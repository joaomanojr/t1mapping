N2  - Abstract The risk ranking exercises related to biological hazards undertaken in fourteen risk assessments of the EFSA/BIOHAZ Panel were reviewed. The aim was to suggest risk ranking tools to be used in future risk assessments and to analyse strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to risk ranking. It was concluded that there is no universal methodology for risk ranking. A conceptual risk ranking framework with nine separate stages is proposed to allow the adoption of the appropriate risk ranking methodology at each stage. Further, nine risk ranking tools developed by other institutions worldwide were described, although none of these could be recommended as the single risk ranking tool for the BIOHAZ Panel. It is recommended that the risk ranking exercise should take a structured approach and be transparently and consistently documented so to be reproducible. The importance of the proper correspondence between the time frame and the requirements of the risk ranking exercise was stressed as well as the interaction between the risk managers and the risk assessors in the definition of the risk ranking purpose and the presentation of the results. Furthermore the development of a risk ranking toolbox based on the proposed framework should be investigated, since such a toolbox would support the construction of consistent and transparent risk ranking models.

N2  - The main objectives of EFSA's activities on emerging risks are:(i) to identify emerging risks in the areas within the remit of EFSA;and (ii) to develop and improve emerging risk identification methodologies and approaches. The current technical report summarises the activities of all groups involved in the emerging risk identification procedure, the issues identified in the course of 2018, a description of methodologies being developed and collaborative activities. EFSA networks of knowledge contributing to the emerging risks identification activity include the Emerging Risks Exchange Network, the StakeholderDiscussion Group on Emerging Risks, EFSA's scientific units, scientific panels and the Scientific Committee and its working groups. Summaries of emerging risk identification procedures in use by different stakeholders are presented.In total, 18 potential emerging issues were discussed in 2018. The issues were classified according to hazard [microbiological hazard (10), chemical hazard (2), other (e.g. antimicrobial resistance and allergies) (1)] and/or the driver underlying the emerging issues identified [illegal activity (2), new consumer trends (2), climate changerelated (1) and new process or technology (3)]. The Standing Working Group Emerging Risks revised the Emerging Risks identification process to better describe the role of EFSA networks of knowledge in identifying potential issues, the drafting and reviewing briefing notes by consultation with different stakeholders and the characterisation of issues by the already established criteria (novelty, soundness severity imminence and scale), but also byproviding clear recommendations to other stakeholders. Communication is a fundamental part of the emerging risk identification procedure. The results of the EU insights study did not indicate that emerging risks triggered significantly greater levels of concern to the public than established risks and suggested that by communicating information about the nature of the risk and the level of uncertainty that surrounds it, a proportionate perception of risk is achieved. Food fraud was of greater concern to consumers than other types of emerging risks. Food fraud can be an important driver for food safety emerging risks and it is important to better integrate risk assessment work on food safety into food fraud investigations. The review of the emerging risk identification (ERI) procedure conducted by the SWG-ER provided conclusions and recommendations that will guide the future developments of the procedure in alignment with EFSA strategic objectives

N2  - The main objectives of EFSA's activities on emerging risks are: (i) to carry out activities to identify emerging risks; and (ii) to develop and improve emerging risk identification (ERI) methodologies and approaches and iii) communicate on identified issues and risks. The outcome of these activities also allows EFSA to prepare for future risk assessment challenges.The current technical report summarises the activities of all groups involved in the emerging risk identification procedure, the issues identified in the course of 2019, a description of methodologies being developed and collaborative activities.EFSA networks of knowledge contributing to the emerging risks identification activity include the Emerging Risks Exchange Network, the StakeholderDiscussion Group on Emerging Risks, EFSA's scientific units, scientific panels and the Scientific Committee and its working groups. In total, 17 potential emerging issues were discussed in 2019. Thirteen were concluded to be emerging issues. The potential issues were classified according to the hazard and/or driver identified. A change in consumer behaviour trends as a driver for emerging issues in food safety was identified for more than half of the issues discussed in 2019. A better understanding of these trends is particularly relevant for EFSA to improve preparedness. In addition, in 2019 EREN network members presented and discussed a total of 28 signals/ potential emerging issues identified by their own horizon scanning activities. Different Member states representatives shared their work on signals identification with the objective to collect additional information that can be used for better characterization. More effective methods to collect and share knowledge need to be implemented. Collaboration was a main feature of the 2019 ERI activities. The number of observers increased, a common session between EREN and StaDGER was organized for the first time and collaboration between institutions is a common feature to all methodological development projects.Such collaboration activities require the development of effective digital collaboration tools and a flexible knowledge management system. Communication is a fundamental part of the ERI procedure, in a more ?open knowledge sharing? context it is of increased importance to clearly communicate on the uncertainty associated with the ERI procedure.

N2  - Abstract The European Food Safety Authority's has established procedures for the identification of emerging risk in food and feed. The main objectives are to: (i) to carry out activities aiming at identifying, assessing and disseminating information on emerging issues and ensure coordination with relevant networks and international organisations; (ii) promote the identification of data sources and data collection and /or data generation in prioritised emerging issues; and the (iii) evaluate of the collected information and identify of emerging risks. The objective(s) of the Standing Working Group on Emerging Risks (SWG-ER) is to collaborate with EFSA on the emerging risks identification (ERI) procedure and provide strategic direction for EFSA work building on past and ongoing projects related to EFSA ERI procedure. The SWG-ER considered the ERI methodologies in place and results obtained by EFSA. It was concluded that a systematic approach to the identification of emerging issues based on experts? networks is the major strength of the procedure but at present, it is mainly focused on single issues, over short to medium time horizons, no consistent weighting or ranking is applied and clear governance of emerging risks with follow-up actions is missing. The analysis highlighted weaknesses with respect to data collection, analysis and integration. No methodology is in place to estimate the value of the procedure outputs in terms of avoided risk and there is urgent need for a communication strategy that addresses the lack of data and knowledge uncertainty and addresses risk perception issues. Recommendations were given in three areas: (i) Further develop a food system-based approach including the integration of social sciences to improve understanding of interactions and dynamics between actors and drivers and the development of horizon scanning protocols; (ii) Improve data processing pipelines to prepare big data analytics, implement a data validation system and develop data sharing agreements to explore mutual benefits; and (iii) Revise the EFSA procedure for emerging risk identification to increase transparency and improve communication.

N2  - Climate change constitutes a relevant driver of emerging risks. While a broad range of forward-looking studies and reports examine the impact of climate change on food security, future challenges for food and feed safety, plant and animal health and nutritional quality are usually not investigated in depth.The CLimate change and Emerging risks for Food SAfety (CLEFSA) project has explored the possibility of: (a) using the specific driver, climate change, for long-term anticipation of multiple emerging risks, using scenarios of climate change; (b) using crowdsourcing and text mining to collect a broad range of signals from a variety of information sources; (c) using a knowledge network of experts from international organisations; (d) designing a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis tool for characterising signals through a participatory process, in which expert knowledge is used to identify relevant issues from the vast and often incomplete information; (e) developing methodologies and indicators for the analysis of the information available, addressing uncertainty.Climate change and its implications for food safety demand complex scientific study, given the number and diversity of hazards to be considered, the large uncertainties involved and the interconnections between the different areas. The effects of climate change are characterised by a multidisciplinary nature (human?plant?animal health and environmental sciences) and go beyond the recognition of specific emerging risks. CLEFSA has identified numerous issues that are driven by climate change and that may affect food safety in Europe. Climate change has the potential of causing, enhancing or modifying the occurrence and intensity of some food-borne diseases and the establishment of invasive alien species harmful to plant and animal health. It has an impact on the occurrence, intensity and toxicity of blooms of potentially toxic marine and freshwater algae and bacteria, on the dominance and persistence of various parasites, fungi, viruses, vectors and invasive species, harmful to plant and animal health. Climate change is likely to drive the (re)emergence of new hazards, increase the exposure or the susceptibility to known hazards and change the levels of micronutrients and macronutrients in food and feed items. By the very nature of the challenge, this list is inevitably incomplete, and undoubtedly unanticipated surprises await us in the future.

N2  - Abstract The Panel has interpreted the Terms of Reference as a stepwise analysis of issues relevant to both the development and the evaluation of models to assess ecological effects of pesticides. The regulatory model should be selected or developed to address the relevant specific protection goal. The basis of good modelling practice must be the knowledge of relevant processes and the availability of data of sufficient quality. The opinion identifies several critical steps in order to set models within risk assessment, namely: problem formulation, considering the specific protection goals for the taxa or functional groups of concern; model domain of applicability, which drives the species and scenarios to model; species (and life stage) selection, considering relevant life history traits and toxicological/toxicokinetics characteristics of the pesticide; selection of the environmental scenario, which is defined by a combination of abiotic, biotic and agronomic parameters to provide a realistic worst-case situation. Model development should follow the modelling cycle, in which every step has to be fully documented: (i) problem definition; (ii) model formulation, i.e. design of a conceptual model; (iii) model formalisation, in which variables and parameters are linked together into mathematical equations or algorithms; (iv) model implementation, in which a computer code is produced and verified; (v) model setup, including sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis and comparison with observed data, that delivers the regulatory model; (vi) prior to actual use in risk assessment, the regulatory model should be evaluated for relevance to the specific protection goals; (vii) feedback from risk assessor with possible recommendations for model improvement. Model evaluation by regulatory authorities should consider each step of the modelling cycle: the opinion identifies points of particular attention for the use of mechanistic effect models in pesticide risk assessment. It is recommended that models be documented in a complete and transparent way, that a feedback platform be established involving risk assessors and model developers, and that a set of agreed models be made available.

N2  - Abstract Since the recent appearance of neutrosophic theory as a generalization of fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy theories, many multicriteria decision methods have adopted this theory to deal with incomplete and indeterminate data. However, it has not yet been applied to the data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology. Therefore, this study presents a DEA model with triangular neutrosophic inputs and outputs that considers the truth, indeterminacy, and falsity degrees of each data value. As an alternative, a parametric approach based on what we term the variation degree of a triangular neutrosophic number is developed. This approach transforms a neutrosophic DEA model into an interval DEA model that can be solved using one of many existing techniques. Interval efficiency scores obtained from our numerical example show the flexibility and authenticity of the proposed approach.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to optimize a microemulsion liquid chromatography method for the simultaneous determination of norfloxacin and tinidazole binary mixture using a chemometric protocol. Optimization experiments were conducted through a process of screening and optimization. A 27-4 fractional factorial design was used as screening design. While the location of optimum conditions was established by applying Derringer's desirability function. The optimal mobile phase composition was predicted to be: 3.5% w/v SDS, 10.03% v/v 1-propanol, 0.5% v/v 1-octanol, and 0.3% triethylamine in 0.02 M phosphoric acid at pH 6.5. The mobile phase was delivered isocratically at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with UV detection at 290 nm. Tinidazole and norfloxacin were eluted with retention times of 1.8 and 5.8 min, respectively. The calibration plots displayed good linear relationships in the concentration ranges of 0.5?50 and 0.75?75 ?g/mL for norfloxacin and tinidazole, respectively. The method was successfully applied for determination of both drugs in pharmaceutical dosage forms and real human plasma. Where the accuracy was proved by the low values of % error and high values of recovery, also the relative standard deviation for the results did not exceed 1.5%, proving the precision of the method.

N2  - AbstractThis paper explores the effects of the correlation model, the trend model, and the number of training points on the accuracy of Kriging metamodels. Gaussian correlation models are found to be superior to exponential and linear correlation models. No particular trend model is found to be better than the other models. The number of training points used in constructing the Kriging metamodels is observed to change the relative performances of the trend and the correlation functions. The leave-one-out cross-validation error is found to become a better surrogate for the actual error, as the number of training points is increased. Finally, the use of an ensemble of metamodels is discussed and it is found that using an ensemble may improve the accuracy.

N2  - Abstract The objective of this study was to develop a methodology to optimize mixtures of natural, noncaloric sweeteners?with the highest sweetness and the lowest bitterness?for carbonated soft drinks. To this end, and with the aid of a trained sensory panel, we first determined the most suitable mixtures of tagatose, sucrose, and stevia in a soft drink matrix, using a three-component simplex lattice mixture design. Then, we developed a multi-objective thermodynamically-based decision model to this purpose. Results indicate that both, sucrose and tagatose, were able to reduce stevia's bitterness. However, an increase of bitterness intensity was found above 0.23?g/L of stevia (sucrose equivalency or SE?>5). Both, sensory analysis and multi-objective decision modeling identified similar optimal mixtures, corresponding to 23?39?g/L sucrose, 0.19?0.34?g/L stevia, and 34?42?g/L tagatose, depending on the desired sweetness/bitterness balance. Within this constrained area, a reduction of almost 60% of sucrose can be achieved in both approaches, keeping bitterness intensity low. Practical applications Current demand of low-calorie beverages has significantly raised as a result of consumer concerns on the negative effects of refined sugars present in carbonated soft drinks. Consequently, natural sweeteners, and their mixtures, are being increasingly used for these product developments. This study provides a methodology to optimize mixtures of natural, noncaloric sweeteners for preparing carbonated soft drinks with the lowest possible caloric content, while maintaining the tastiness?high sweetness and low bitterness?of full caloric ones, containing the bulk sweetener tagatose and the high-intensity sweetener stevia.

N2  - Abstract Obsolescence occurs when system elements become outdated, and it leads to operational, logistical, reliability, and cost implications. In the U.S. military, this problem is a result of the U.S. Department of Defense's (DoD) departure from Military Specification (MILSPEC) standards in 1994 and transition to the use of Commercial Off the Shelf products. Obsolescence costs the DoD more than $750 million annually. The current risk management tools for obsolescence are based on a quantitative approach that uses cost optimization, and expert judgment is not used as a critical criterion. A review of the literature has revealed that during the design phase of technological systems, there is limited knowledge and a lack of training associated with mitigating obsolescence, and multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods are not currently used to mitigate the risk of obsolescence. Thus, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS, which is a MCDM method) and Monte Carlo simulations are proposed as the foundation for this work. This paper adds to the methodology by introducing an expert judgment criterion. A case study was conducted using military and civilian experts. Expert validation showed that the TOPSIS model successfully identified the best system for mitigating obsolescence. This model can be used by system designers and other decision makers to conduct trade studies in obsolescence management.

N2  - Abstract In the conservation of endangered species, suppression of a population of one native species to benefit another poses challenges. Examples include predator control and nest parasite reduction. Less obvious is the control of blood-feeding arthropods. We conducted a case study of the effect of native black flies (Simulium spp.) on reintroduced Whooping Cranes (Grus americana). Our intent was to provide a science-driven approach for determining the effects of blood-feeding arthropods on endangered vertebrates and identifying optimal management actions for managers faced with competing objectives. A multiyear experiment demonstrated that black flies reduce nest success in cranes by driving incubating birds off their nests. We used a decision-analytic approach to develop creative management alternatives and evaluate trade-offs among competing objectives. We identified 4 management objectives: establish a self-sustaining crane population, improve crane well-being, maintain native black flies as functional components of the ecosystem, and minimize costs. We next identified potential management alternatives: do nothing, suppress black flies, force crane renesting to occur after the activity period of black flies, relocate releases of cranes, suppress black flies and relocate releases, or force crane renesting and relocate releases. We then developed predictions on constructed scales of 0 (worst-performing alternative) to 1 (best-performing alternative) to indicate how alternative actions performed in terms of management objectives. The optimal action depended on the relative importance of each objective to a decision maker. Only relocating releases was a dominated alternative, indicating that it was not optimal regardless of the relative importance of objectives. A rational decision maker could choose any other management alternative we considered. Recognizing that decisions involve trade-offs that must be weighed by decision makers is crucial to identifying alternatives that best balance multiple management objectives. Given uncertainty about the population dynamics of blood-feeding arthropods, an adaptive management approach could offer substantial benefits.

N2  - Abstract This qualitative study investigates the structure of the buying centre, the buying process, and the factors that influence buying decisions for perishable-products packaging. This empirical investigation is based on the case study of a major Quebec food retailer. We show that the purchase of packaging changes significantly depending on whether the product is considered more or less strategic for the organization, which determines the required level of packaging customization. Buying centre structure becomes more complex as packaging customization increases. Given the multi-functionality and the interdisciplinarity of packaging, we propose a multi-criteria analysis grid to improve buying decision efficiency and to streamline communication between the various levels of the buying centre.

N2  - Several new aggregation operators are proposed in the context of multicriteria decision making (MCDM) in the linguistic domain. The proposed operators first infer the discrimination index, based on the extent of variability in the various linguistic evaluations against a criterion. This value is then utilized in the actual aggregation step to discriminate among the alternatives. Besides, the proposed operators also take into account the a priori weights associated with the criteria. The proposed concepts are illustrated through an example in group MCDM.

N2  - Abstract Attitudinal Choquet integral (ACI) extends Choquet integral (CI) through a consideration of a decision-maker's (DM's) attitudinal character. In this paper, we generalize ACI, and the resulting operator is termed as generalized ACI (GACI). GACI adds to the efficacy of the ACI in the representation of a DM's unique and complex attitudinal character. It also generates a vast range of exponential ACI operators, such as harmonic ACI, ACI, quadratic ACI, to name a few. We further present induced GACI to consider additional information that may be associated with the arguments of aggregation. The special cases of the proposed operators are investigated. The usefulness of the proposed operators in modelling human decision behavior is shown through a case study.

N2  - Abstract Traditional portfolio management tools and methods are challenging for software companies that use agile and lean approaches, because of the complex pre-planning activities required. In this paper, traditional portfolio management tools and methods that have been conventionally used in industry and presented in literature are reviewed. Findings concerning their use in agile and lean software companies are investigated, on the basis of the literature review and semi-structured interviews conducted in 7 agile and lean software companies in Finland. The findings indicate that the studied companies do not use traditional portfolio management tools and methods in their entirety. The software companies adapted suitable components from traditional portfolio management tools and methods into their practices. They also apply new tools and methods to manage their portfolios of offerings, to cope with the dynamics required by agile and lean methods. The companies' emphasis is on using tools to facilitate immediate feedback from customers, to assess the value of offerings in their portfolio. The results showed a growing interest in using Kanban at the portfolio level to provide a visual overview of offerings.

N2  - Abstract Majority of software development firms are adopting the concepts of global software development (GSD) in order to develop high-quality and low-cost products. However, the requirements change management (RCM) becomes a significant challenge in the GSD environment because of the unavailability of proper RCM framework and taxonomy. The objective of this study is to develop a taxonomy of the challenging factors of the RCM process in GSD. The taxonomy is developed based on the results of the data collected during the survey study and the implementation of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Total 25 challenging factors are identified and mapped into four core categories, ie, ?organizational management,? ?team,? ?technology,? and ?process.? Moreover, the AHP analysis is performed to prioritize the challenging factors and their categories. The prioritization process highlight that ?process? is the most significant category of the RCM challenging factors. The taxonomy developed in this study provides a robust framework to tackle problems associated with RCM activities in GSD environment, which is significant to the success and progression of GSD firms.

This study aims to identify the success factors (SFs) for CSDO and prioritize them based on their significance. To achieve this objective, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) and survey study with industrial and academic experts. Finally, we applied the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to develop the framework based on the prioritization of the identified SFs. We believe that the findings of this study will assist the industry practitioners and researchers in developing effective strategies for the successful implementation of CSDO activities.

N2  - Abstract The main objective of this study is to present a simulation-optimization approach methodology for short-term operation of multi-objective reservoirs during emergency conditions where risk of flooding and overflow from damaged spillways is significant. The paper considers flood risk management through enhancing dam safety as well as long-term objectives of the reservoir for hydropower generation and irrigation water supply simultaneously. In particular, real-time operation of Abbaspour reservoir during an emergency condition is considered where all flood discharging facilities are out of order for repairing the damaged parts. The proposed methodology combines a short-term and a long-term operation strategies to minimize risk of overflow for any possible incoming floods while preserving the long-term objectives of the reservoir. An efficient daily flow forecasting scheme provides the inflow data for the short-term (daily) operation strategy in a deterministic environment which follows the long-term operation policy. A multi-objective stochastic dynamic programming model addresses the long-term operation policy by solving the weekly operation model. The outcomes of the model application to the case study have illustrated its capabilities in developing a compromise between the risk of dam overflow and its long-term objectives.

N2  - Abstract A complex Pythagorean fuzzy set, an extension of Pythagorean fuzzy set, is a powerful tool to handle two dimension phenomenon. Dombi operators with operational parameters have outstanding flexibility. This article presents certain aggregation operators under complex Pythagorean fuzzy environment, including complex Pythagorean Dombi fuzzy weighted arithmetic averaging (CPDFWAA) operator, complex Pythagorean Dombi fuzzy weighted geometric averaging (CPDFWGA) operator, complex Pythagorean Dombi fuzzy ordered weighted arithmetic averaging (CPDFOWAA) operator and complex Pythagorean Dombi fuzzy ordered weighted geometric averaging (CPDFOWGA) operator. Moreover, this paper explores some fundamental properties of these operators with appropriate elaboration. A decision-making numerical example related to the selection of bank to purchase loan is given to demonstrate the significance of our proposed approach. Finally, a comparative analysis with existing operators is given to demonstrate the peculiarity of our proposed operators.

The proposed learning methods consist of two stages: The first stage involves using the discretization techniques to obtain the required parameters for the PROAFTN method, and the second stage is the development of a new inductive approach to construct PROAFTN prototypes for classification. The comparative study is based on the generated classification accuracy of the algorithms on the data sets. For further robust analysis of the experiments, we used the Friedman statistical measure with the corresponding post hoc tests. The proposed approaches significantly improved the performance of the classification method PROAFTN. Based on the generated results on the same data sets, PROAFTN outperforms widely used classification algorithms. Furthermore, the method is simple, no preprocessing is required, and no loss of information during learning. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Abstract Big data adoption (BDA) and its barriers, opportunities, and expected benefits are increasingly attracting researchers' and practitioners' attention. For developing economies, BDA has special importance; however, they have struggled to identify the barriers hindering it. This study aims to identify the barriers to BDA in developing economies and their relative importance across sectors to identify sectors' readiness for BDA. Based on a review of the BDA literature, semi-structured interviews with big data (BD) experts, and a questionnaire-based survey, five barrier sets, and 19 sub-barriers were identified. Thereafter, barrier sets for each sector were identified, analyzed, discussed, and compared. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to identify the relative importance of these barriers across sectors, while the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was used to rank sectors according to their readiness for BDA. This study positions itself as a reference for scholars and practitioners interested in BDA in developing economies.

N2  - Abstract Aquaculture, particularly marine-based production, is one of the fastest growing industries in Indonesia. Indonesia's competitiveness in the trade of aquaculture products is constrained by a lack of research and development (R&D) of new aquaculture species candidates. Mariculture has the greatest potential due to Indonesia's vast marine resources and archipelagic geography. Although there are over 3,000 species of marine fish in Indonesia, only 14 species have been widely cultured, largely finfish. Production is dominated by shrimp, groupers and milkfish. Traditionally, candidate species for mariculture in Indonesia and elsewhere have often been selected on their market value before their biological suitability for culture has been established leading to partially successful R&D efforts or even failure. The present study developed a framework for selecting marine fish species to support mariculture R&D in Indonesia based on an improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The approach combined various quantitative and qualitative data and involved different R&D stakeholder groups in the selection process. Ten species that had not been previously researched for their aquaculture potential were identified. The modified approach addressed the interaction complexity of criteria and different preferences across the stakeholders. The involvement of different stakeholders in the selection process not only ensured acceptance of the selected species for further research, but also tested the validity and consistency of the method used in this study. The methodology has relevance for mariculture globally given that efficient candidate selection can help focus efforts and investment in mariculture R&D.

N2  - A key feature of risk analysis is that risk assessment and risk management should be functionally separated. However, the usefulness of a risk assessment may be limited if the output is not designed to help with risk management decisions. The COMRISK project investigated the communication between risk assessors and risk managers. The overall goal of the project was to identify current practices and challenges in communication between risk assessors and risk managers during the risk analysis process, and thus increase and improve the understanding and the quality of the communication between them. Specific actions to achieve this aim included reviewing of historical food safety cases, analysing risk assessment requests, identifying communication guiding documents, including legislation and agreements, conducting semi-structured interviews with risk assessors and risk managers, and identifying tools for facilitating the communication between risk assessors and risk managers. It was concluded that the usefulness of a risk assessment is strongly dependent on well-defined and mutually recognised risk questions and that scarce or poor communication between risk assessors and risk managers is one of the major reasons when an output from risk assessment fails to support risk management. The communication between risk assessors and risk managers preceding the onset of the risk assessment, when the risk assessment requests with its risk questions are defined, is especially identified as one of the critical points to ensure a risk assessment that is fit for purpose. However, difficulties in understanding were also reported for the communication between risk assessors and risk managers during and after the risk assessment. Lack of communication is seldom a result of formal constraints or agreements nor can it be explained by a wish of the risk assessors or risk managers. Instead, perceived constraints or traditions appear to be possible underlying factors leading to scarce or poor communication between risk assessors and risk managers. It is essential that both risk assessors and risk managers acknowledge the crucial importance of communication between them while at the same time respect their different roles in a risk analysis.According to respondents, the best solution to facilitate the framing of the risk assessment questions isan open dialogue between risk assessors and risk managers to agree on the goal of the assessment and to build trust. Further, the interviewresults indicate that a formal systematic process may facilitate communication during the risk analysis. Where there is uncertainty, e.g due to data gaps or issues related to the methodology and models, it should be acknowledged and described properly by risk assessors to risk managers. Training of risk assessors and risk managers may improve the possibility of a timely and fit-for-purpose output.Such a training should give a deeper insight in the risk management process, give a better understanding of the risk managers role, and especially raise the awareness of the importance of the communication between risk assessors and risk managers.To improve the risk analysis process, it is also important that the risk assessor gets feedback regarding how risk assessments have met the needs of the risk managers.The present study also found that aspects of risk communication studied in this project are not extensively discussed in the guidance documents for risk analysis. More research is needed to identify the barriers for a fit for purpose communication.

N2  - Abstract Chemical complexity of natural products often results in their pharmacological polypotency. However, selecting a natural product with desirable activity profile is not a straightforward task, especially if optimization of one feature results in deterioration of other facets. Recently, in the field of multiobjective optimization, the sum of ranking differences (SRD) has emerged as a simple and statistically sound method for fusion of multiple criteria. However, the data pretreatment seems to strongly influence the ranking outcome, which may lead to ambiguous or even false interpretations. Therefore, in the present study, the data of 55 essential oils originated from different plant species and tested on multiple bacterial and fungal strains as well as 4 antioxidative assays were studied. Essential oils were ranked using the classical Deringer desirability approach, and results were compared with the SRD analysis of primary activity data as well as the previously row-wise standardized data, normalized data, and the data scaled to fit the preferences. Ultimately, the most promising candidate (polypotent) essential oils, as well as the most resilient and most sensitive bacterial and fungal strains, and antioxidative assays were identified. Data transformation based on the Deringer desirability approach, compared with the data that have not been previously transformed or those that transformed using a row-wise standardization or normalization to the unit length vector, seemed to be the crucial step providing the sound and meaningful SRD ranking.

N2  - Abstract This study addresses a problem called cost-minimizing target setting in data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology. The problem is how to make an inefficient decision-making unit efficient by allocating to it as few organizational resources as possible, assuming that the marginal costs of reducing inputs or increasing outputs are known and available, which is different from previous furthest and closest DEA targets setting methods. In this study, an existed cost minimizing target setting heuristics approach based on input-oriented model is examined to show that there exist some limitations. This study develops a simple mixed integer linear programming to determine the desired targets on the strongly efficient frontier based on non-oriented DEA model considering the situation in the presence of known marginal costs of reducing inputs and increasing outputs simultaneously. Some experiments with the simulated datasets are conducted, and results show that the proposed model can obtain more accurate projections with lower costs compared with those from furthest and closest target setting approaches. Besides, the proposed model can be realistic and efficient in solving cost-minimizing target setting problem.

N2  - Abstract The purpose of this paper is to evaluate Turkish banks' multidimensional corporate sustainability performance and whether banks' sustainability efforts are value related. Both qualitative and quantitative data analysis, namely content analysis, entropy based and TOPSIS techniques, have been utilized in order to measure the sustainability performance. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient has been employed to investigate the nexus between overall sustainability performance scores of the banks and market value during the years 2013 and 2015. The results of this study are insignificant in the ongoing debate on whether Turkish banks' sustainability efforts are value related. However, a significant and positive relationship has been found between the financial sustainability performance and the market value in the long run. Additionally, a multidimensional corporate sustainability model that has the five dimensions of economic, environmental, social, governance and financial disclosures has been proposed. This paper is among the first to explore the nexus between sustainability performance and market value in Turkey.

N2  - Objective To develop new classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) jointly supported by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Methods This international initiative had four phases. 1) Evaluation of antinuclear antibody (ANA) as an entry criterion through systematic review and meta-regression of the literature and criteria generation through an international Delphi exercise, an early patient cohort, and a patient survey. 2) Criteria reduction by Delphi and nominal group technique exercises. 3) Criteria definition and weighting based on criterion performance and on results of a multi-criteria decision analysis. 4) Refinement of weights and threshold scores in a new derivation cohort of 1,001 subjects and validation compared with previous criteria in a new validation cohort of 1,270 subjects. Results The 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SLE include positive ANA at least once as obligatory entry criterion; followed by additive weighted criteria grouped in 7 clinical (constitutional, hematologic, neuropsychiatric, mucocutaneous, serosal, musculoskeletal, renal) and 3 immunologic (antiphospholipid antibodies, complement proteins, SLE-specific antibodies) domains, and weighted from 2 to 10. Patients accumulating ≥10 points are classified. In the validation cohort, the new criteria had a sensitivity of 96.1% and specificity of 93.4%, compared with 82.8% sensitivity and 93.4% specificity of the ACR 1997 and 96.7% sensitivity and 83.7% specificity of the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics 2012 criteria. Conclusion These new classification criteria were developed using rigorous methodology with multidisciplinary and international input, and have excellent sensitivity and specificity. Use of ANA entry criterion, hierarchically clustered, and weighted criteria reflects current thinking about SLE and provides an improved foundation for SLE research.

N2  - The rapid growth of new computing paradigms such as Cloud Computing and Big Data has unleashed great opportunities for companies to shift their business model towards a fully digital strategy. A major obstacle in this matter is the requirement of highly specialized ICT infrastructures that are expensive and difficult to manage. It is at this point that the IaaS (infrastructure as a service) model offers an efficient and cost-affordable solution to supply companies with their required computing resources. In the Big Data context, it is often a hard task to design an optimal IaaS solution that meets user requirements. In this context, we propose a methodology to optimize the definition of IaaS cloud models for hosting Big Data platforms, following a threefold criterion: cost, reliability, and computing capacity. Specifically, the proposed methodology hinges on evolutionary heuristics in order to find IaaS configurations in the cloud that optimally balance such objectives. We also define measures to quantify the aforementioned metrics over a Big Data platform hosted within an IaaS cloud model. The proposed method is validated by using real information from three IaaS providers and three Big Data platforms. The obtained results provide an insightful input for system managers when initially designing cloud infrastructures for Big Data applications.

N2  - Summary Sustainable energy production has been one of the contemporary concerns of society. In order to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions while generating the required demand for energy, various energy technologies, and production systems must be considered. In the consideration of different energy technologies, optimization is one of the important tools to optimally design energy systems. This study aims to analyze the progress of current research related to energy and sustainability that utilizes fuzzy optimization approach. Bibliometric methods based on the database of Web of Science core collection are used for the analysis. Of the 96 retrieved publications, 87% were journal articles. Analysis on the patterns for these articles were conducted such as highly cited articles, journals, subject categories, institutions, countries, and impact factor. The articles are evaluated into three categories such as technological, environmental, and economy and are comprehensively reviewed. The results showed a significant increase in publication related to fuzzy optimization in sustainability and energy technologies. The analysis showed China with 26 publications, which has the largest contribution in terms of the number of articles published. North China Electric Power University ranked as the number 1 institution with 10 publications. Based on the comprehensive analysis, fuzzy optimization showed significant results on technological, environmental, and economical factors. These findings help to identify hotspots in energy technology optimization for sustainability research. Similarly, the study gives useful inputs for selecting subtopics and strategy on publication related to fuzzy optimization on energy technologies.

N2  - Summary Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that has caused widespread outbreaks throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, with serious consequences for livestock-based economies and public health. Although there have never been any reports of RVF in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, it is a priority disease in the Maghreb, due to the threat of introduction of the virus through transboundary livestock movements or infected mosquito vectors. However, the implementation of surveillance activities and early warning contingency plans requires better knowledge of the epidemiological situation. We conducted a multicriteria decision analysis, integrating host distribution with a combination of important ecological factors that drive mosquito abundance, to identify hotspots and suitable time periods for RVF enzootic circulation (i.e. stable transmission at a low to moderate level for an extended period of time) and an RVF epizootic event (i.e. a sudden occurrence of a large number of infected animals over a large geographic area) in the Maghreb. We also modelled vector species distribution using available information on vector presence and habitat preference. We found that the northern regions of the Maghreb were moderately suitable for RVF enzootics, but highly suitable for RVF epizootics. The vector species distribution model identified these regions as the most favourable mosquito habitats. Due to the low density of animal hosts and arid conditions, the desert region showed low RVF suitability, except in oases. However, the presence of competent vectors in putative unsuitable areas underlines the need for further assessments of mosquito habitat preference. This study produced monthly RVF suitability maps useful for animal health managers and veterinary services involved in designing risk-based surveillance programmes. The suitability maps can be further enhanced using existing country-specific sources of information and by incorporating knowledge ? as it becomes available ? on the epidemiology of the disease and distribution of vectors in the Maghreb.

N2  - Summary Online argumentation systems enable stakeholders to post their problems under consideration and solution alternatives and to exchange arguments over the alternatives posted in an argumentation tree. In an argumentation process, stakeholders have their own opinions, which very often contrast and conflict with opinions of others. Some of these opinions may be outliers with respect to the mean group opinion. This paper presents a method for identifying stakeholders with outlier opinions in an argumentation process. It detects outlier opinions on the basis of individual stakeholder's opinions, as well as collective opinions on them from other stakeholders. Decision makers and other participants in an argumentation process therefore have an opportunity to explore the outlier opinions within their groups from both individual and group perspectives. In a large argumentation tree, it is often difficult to identify stakeholders with outlier opinions manually. The system presented in this paper identifies them automatically. Experiments are presented to evaluate the proposed method. Their results show that the method detects outlier opinions in an online argumentation process effectively.

N2  - Abstract This paper presents an application of a new methodological framework for undertaking distributional cost-effectiveness analysis to combine the objectives of maximising health and minimising unfair variation in health when evaluating population health interventions. The National Health Service bowel cancer screening programme introduced in 2006 is expected to improve population health on average and to worsen population health inequalities associated with deprivation and ethnicity ? a classic case of ?intervention-generated inequality?. We demonstrate the distributional cost-effectiveness analysis framework by examining two redesign options for the bowel cancer screening programme: (i) the introduction of an enhanced targeted reminder aimed at increasing screening uptake in deprived and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods and (ii) the introduction of a basic universal reminder aimed at increasing screening uptake across the whole population. Our analysis indicates that the universal reminder is the strategy that maximises population health, while the targeted reminder is the screening strategy that minimises unfair variation in health. The framework is used to demonstrate how these two objectives can be traded off against each other, and how alternative social value judgements influence the assessment of which strategy is best, including judgements about which dimensions of health variation are considered unfair and judgements about societal levels of inequality aversion. ? 2014 The Authors.

N2  - Abstract The paper presents an approach to spatially representative depiction for assessing the vulnerability of central Iran's Zayandeh-Rood river basin to drought using multiple indicators. Drought conditions prevailed in the study basin from 2002 to 2007, with an annual rainfall deficiency of 45 to 55%. Multi-attribute decision making (MADM) methods develop a framework to evaluate the relative priorities of drought assessment based on a set of preferences, criteria and indicators. The proposed MADM process uses well-known techniques for product weights analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and order preference (TOPSIS). These indicators include the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), water demand, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Groundwater Balance and Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI). Indicators' spatial information was categorised in layers prepared in the spatial domain using a geographic information system (GIS). The alternatives were ranked and presented using TOPSIS. Results show that the proposed method was highly effective in representing assessments of drought vulnerability.

N2  - Abstract This investigation attempts to understand the eco-hydrology of, and accordingly suggest an option to manage floodwater for agriculture in, the understudied and data-sparse ephemeral Baraka River Basin within the hyper-arid region of Sudan. Reference is made to the major feature of the basin, that is, the Toker Delta spate irrigation scheme. A point-to-pixel comparison of gridded and ground-based data sets is performed to enhance the estimates of rainfall. Analysis of remotely sensed land use/cover data is performed. The results show a significant reduction of the grassland and barren areas explained by a significant expansion of the cropland and open shrubland (invasive mesquite trees) areas in the delta. The cotton sown area is highly dependent on the flooded area and the discharge volume in the delta. However, the area of this major crop has declined since the early 1990s in favour of cultivation of more profitable food crops. Expansion of mesquite in the delta is problematic, taking hold under increased floodwater, and can only be manged by clearance to provide crop cultivation area. There is a great potential for floodwater harvesting during the rainfall season (June to September). A total seasonal runoff volume of around 4.6 and 10.8 billion cubic metres is estimated at 90 and 50% probabilities of exceedance (reliabilities), respectively. Rather than leaving the runoff generated from rainfall events to pass to the Red Sea or be consumed by mesquite trees, a location for runoff harvesting structure in a highly suitable area is proposed. Such a structure will support any policy shifts towards planning and managing the basin water resources for use in irrigating the agricultural scheme.

N2  - Summary In recent years, the credibility of information on social networks has attracted considerable of interest due to its critical role in the spread of information online. In this paper, we argue that the quality of information created on social networks can be analyzed using its provenance data. In particular, we propose an algorithm that assesses information credibility on social networks in order to detect fake or malicious information using a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to assign proper weights to the proposed metrics. In order to test the usability of the proposed algorithm, we introduce a prototype implementation and test it on a large-scale synthetic social provenance dataset. The initial results reveal a proportional relationship between our proposed distance from positivity algorithm and the provenance graph metrics-based user credibility.

N2  - Abstract The selection of skilful players is a complicated process due to the problem criteria consisting of both qualitative and quantitative attributes as well as vague linguistic terms. This study seeks to develop a decision support framework for the selection of candidates eligible to become basketball players through the use of a fuzzy multi-attribute decision making (MADM) algorithm. The proposed model is based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods. The model was employed in the Youth and Sports Center of Mugla, Turkey, with the participation of seven junior basketball players aged between 7 and 14. In the present study, physical fitness measurement values and observation values of technical skills were utilized. FAHP was used to determine the weights of the criteria and the observation values of technical skills by decision makers. Physical fitness measurement values were converted to fuzzy values by using a fuzzy set approach. Subsequently, the overall ranking of the candidate players was determined by the TOPSIS method. Results were compared with human experts? opinions. It is observed that the developed model is more reliable to be used in decision making. The model architecture and experimental results along with illustrative examples are further demonstrated in the study.

N2  - Abstract Soil and its ecosystem functions play a societal role in securing sustainable food production while safeguarding natural resources. A functional land management framework has been proposed to optimize the agro-environmental outputs from the land and specifically the supply and demand of soil functions such as (a) primary productivity, (b) carbon sequestration, (c) water purification and regulation, (d) biodiversity and (e) nutrient cycling, for which soil knowledge is essential. From the outset, the LANDMARK multi-actor research project integrates harvested knowledge from local, national and European stakeholders to develop such guidelines, creating a sense of ownership, trust and reciprocity of the outcomes. About 470 stakeholders from five European countries participated in 32 structured workshops covering multiple land uses in six climatic zones. The harmonized results include stakeholders? priorities and concerns, perceptions on soil quality and functions, implementation of tools, management techniques, indicators and monitoring, activities and policies, knowledge gaps and ideas. Multi-criteria decision analysis was used for data analysis. Two qualitative models were developed using Decision EXpert methodology to evaluate ?knowledge? and ?needs?. Soil quality perceptions differed across workshops, depending on the stakeholder level and regionally established terminologies. Stakeholders had good inherent knowledge about soil functioning, but several gaps were identified. In terms of critical requirements, stakeholders defined high technical, activity and policy needs in (a) financial incentives, (b) credible information on improving more sustainable management practices, (c) locally relevant advice, (d) farmers? discussion groups, (e) training programmes, (f) funding for applied research and monitoring, and (g) strengthening soil science in education.

N2  - Abstract The aim of this study, following a new approach under the irrationality of managers, is to investigate the most effective determinants of capital structure decisions by combining traditional capital structure determinants with managerial-behavioural biases. In line with this objective, considering the capital structure decision as one that employs multicriteria decision making, two of the multicriteria decision-making methods?namely, Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Analytic Network Process (ANP)?are integrated into a hybrid method to analyse the interdependent relationships among traditional capital structure determinants and managerial-behavioural biases and to prioritize them by making dual comparisons. Our findings show that managerial-behavioural biases, not traditional capital structure determinants, are more effective in the capital structure decision and that anchoring is the most influential among managerial-behavioural biases.

N2  - Preliminary analysis of data collected from trained expert facilitators of ad hoc creative teams suggests that complex analytical techniques such as costed function modeling and decision criteria matrix may have far more impact upon a team's creative effectiveness than frequently researched measures such as idea quantity. An intriguing relationship in these data between complex creativity and the amount of time spent in evaluating ideas and planning their implementation seems to suggest that a shift in definitional focus from ideas to the insights which reveal those ideas may facilitate both research into team creativity and planning of more effective team problem solving.

N2  - The statistical analysis of very large data sets, so-called Big Data or Data Analytics, has become enormously popular in Statistical Analysis and Operations Research. In some cases, such as research into the buying habits of online consumers, the results have come quickly and been very significant. Analysis of other data sets, however, is questionable. For example, time-series based statistical analysis, often under the descriptive envelope of ?neural networks? and ?data mining,? of stock market and futures prices, sometimes in combination with historical accounting figures such as earnings and cash flows. The appeal is understandable given the availability of share price data and cheap computer processing power. Nevertheless, the notion that historical data form some sort of repeatable pattern over time, and that complex time series or neural network techniques can be then be used to forecast future prices is hard to justify. Economic modeling necessarily needs to factor in human behavior, unlike modeling in the pure sciences. The authors cite Lancaster University Professor Michael Pidd who summarizes six relevant principles: Model simple, think complicated Be parsimonious, start small and add Divide and conquer, avoid mega models Use metaphors, analogies and similarities Do not fall in love with data Model building may feel like muddling through. Economic modeling must recognize three key components: (i) the incorporation of human cognitive understanding and experience of the underlying systems, (ii) the use of data to validate emerging models, and (iii) the role of mathematics to ensure internal coherence and logic. Decision-makers ought to be very skeptical of models which skimp on any one of these three components. The authors emphasize that, rather than Big Data adding value, per se, people add value by creating models that use it.

N2  - Abstract Nodes in a computer network often require a copy of a message to be delivered to every node in the network. The network layer can provide such a service, referred to as network-wide broadcast routing or simply ?broadcasting?. Broadcasting has many applications, including its role as a service to many routing protocols. In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), simplistic broadcast schemes (such as flooding) inundate the network with redundancy, contention, collision, and unnecessary use of energy resources. This can prevent broadcasts from achieving their primary objective of maximizing delivery ratio, while also considering secondary objectives, such as balancing energy resources or reducing the network's burden on congested or busy nodes. As a solution, we propose multiple-criteria broadcasting (MCB). In MCB, the source of each broadcast specifies the importance assigned to broadcast objectives. Network nodes use these priorities, along with local and neighbor knowledge of distributed factors, to broadcast in accordance with the objective priorities attributed to the message. Using ns2, the performance of MCB is evaluated and compared to that of other broadcast protocols. To present knowledge, MCB constitutes the first reconfigurable, multi-objective approach to broadcasting. Copyright ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract The employment of a decision support system for optimizing fund raising strategies is crucial to the management of non-profit organizations. Commonly considered methodologies utilize the organization's donor database in order to gather and analyse information. However, many organizations, especially small- and medium-sized ones, do not own or efficiently manage a database, and consequently, the usual methods are inapplicable. In this paper, a decision support system is developed that is able to identify the most promising fund raising strategies on the basis of the organization's profile. The profile factors of a non-profit organization are analysed and hierarchically organized in a decision tree in order to effectively employ the Choquet integral methodology, which is recommended in these kinds of multi-criteria decision problems. The results obtained in the real operational context show the effectiveness of the proposed system.

N2  - Abstract Cloud computing has received a lot of attention from both researcher and developer in last decade due to its unique structure of providing services to the user. As the digitalization of world, heterogeneous devices, and with the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), these IoT devices produce different type of data with distinct frequency, which require real-time and latency sensitive services. This provides great challenge to cloud computing framework. Fog computing is a new framework to accompaniment cloud platform and is proposed to extend services to the edge of the network. In fog computing, the entire user's tasks are offloaded to distributed fog nodes to the edge of network to avoid delay sensitivity. We select fog computing network dwell different set of fog nodes to provide required services to the users. Allocation of defined resource to the users in order to achieve optimal result is a big challenge. Therefore, we propose dynamic resource allocation strategy for cloud, fog node, and users. In the framework, we first formulate the ranks of fog node using TOPSIS to identify most suitable fog node for the incoming request. Simultaneously logistic regression calculates the load of individual fog node and updates the result to send back to the broker for next decision. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme undoubtedly improves the performance and give accuracy of 98.25%.

N2  - Summary In Data Grid systems, quick data access is a challenging issue due to the high latency. The failure of requests is one of the most common matters in these systems that has an impact on performance and access delay. Job scheduling and data replication are two main techniques in reducing access latency. In this paper, we propose two new neighborhood-based job scheduling strategies and a novel neighborhood-based dynamic data replication algorithm (NDDR). The proposed algorithms reduce the access latency by considering a variety of practical parameters for decision making and the access delay by considering the failure probability of a node in job scheduling, replica selection, and replica placement. The proposed neighborhood concept in job scheduling includes all the nodes with low data transmission costs. Therefore, we can select the best computational node and reduce the search time by running a hierarchical and parallel search. NDDR reduces the access latency through selecting the best replica by performing a hierarchical search established based on the access time, storage queue workload, storage speed, and failure probability. NDDR improves the load balancing and data locality by selecting the best replication place considering the workload, temporal locality, geographical locality, and spatial locality. We evaluate our proposed algorithms by using Optorsim Simulator in two scenarios. The simulations confirm that the proposed algorithms improve the results compared with similar existing algorithms by 11%, 15%, 12%, and 10% in terms of mean job time, replication frequency, mean data access latency, and effective network usage, respectively.

N2  - Abstract This paper introduces a novel approach based on NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies to early predict financial distress of Tunisian companies using an important number of inputs. Our sample covers the period of the Jasmin Revolution that led to an increase of the number of bankruptcies, making early previsions even more difficult. Furthermore, we aim to identify the factors that explain financial distress as our approach does not need a process of preselection. All the financial ratios will be used as inputs for the model, and only the ratios with the highest threshold value will remain in the final classifier. To test the accuracy of our model, we will compute a linear discriminant analysis to compare the previsions of the two approaches. Results show that our approach outperforms the traditional one.

N2  - Abstract We propose a new generalization of the discrete Choquet integral based on an arbitrary bivariate symmetric averaging function (mean). So far only the means with a natural multivariate extension were used for this purpose. In this paper, we use a general method based on a pruned binary tree to extend symmetric means with no obvious multivariate form, such as the logarithmic, identric, Heronian, Lagrangean, and Cauchy means. The generalized Choquet integral is built by computing the extensions of the bivariate means of the ordered inputs, and includes some existing extensions as special cases. Our construction is illustrated with multiple examples.

For this reason, an emerging important issue is the definition of a new generation of healthcare platforms capable of monitoring people's quality of life. In this article, we propose a new methodology that supports the entire requirement elicitation process starting from the initial phase of gathering the requirements, both clinical, technological, and end-user, up to the choice of the most suitable solution. Our proposal provides a new new iterative model in the smart healthcare field research area. Furthermore we apply our proposal in a real scenario and we report the end-to-end implementation of the proposed methodology.

N2  - Summary The explosion of cloud services over the Internet has raised new challenges in cloud service selection and ranking. The existence of a great variety of offered cloud services made the users think deeply about the most appropriate services that meet their needs and at the same time are adaptable to their context. Nowadays, online reviews are used for the purpose of enhancing the effectiveness of finding useful product information, having impact on the consumers' decision-making process. In this context, the current paper suggests a context-aware cloud service ranking approach using online reviews and based on sentiment analysis (CROSA). Its main objective is to ease the cloud service selection. The CROSA approach analyzes sentiments associated with service measurement index (SMI)?based service properties for each alternative cloud service. Moreover, it enhances the cloud service decision-making by supporting fuzzy sentiments through the intuitionistic fuzzy set theory and PROMETHEE II. The experimental results presented in this paper show that this approach is efficient and performing.

N2  - To facilitate the practical implementation of the guidance on the residue definition for dietary risk assessment, EFSA has organized an evaluation of applicability of existing in silico models for predicting the genotoxicity of pesticides and their metabolites, including analysis of the impact on genotoxicity of the metabolic structural changes. The prediction ability of (Q)SARs for in vitro and in vivo tests were evaluated. For the Ames test, all (Q)SAR models generated statistically significant predictions, comparable with the experimental variability of the test; instead, the reliability of the (Q)SAR models for assays / endpoints different from in vitro bacterial mutagenicity appears to be quite far from optimality. Secondly, two new Read Across approaches were applied to predict Ames mutagenicity and in vitro Chromosomal Aberrations: Read Across was largely successful for predicting the Ames test results, but much less for in vitro Chromosomal Aberrations. The worse results for endpoints different from Ames may be attributable to the several revisions of experimental protocols and evaluation criteria of results that have made the databases qualitatively non-homogeneous, and poorly suitable for modelling. A third dimension of this research is the evaluation of the impact of the structural changes-in result of metabolic or degradation processes-on the genotoxic potential of the substances. Parent/Metabolite structural differences (beyond the known Structural Alerts) that may, or may not cause changes in the Ames mutagenicity were identified and catalogued. In addition, Structural Alerts analysis applied under human expert supervision permitted the rationalization of the large majority of the changes of patterns of genotoxicity. The findings from this work are suitable for being integrated into Weight-of-Evidence and Tiered evaluation schemes. The importance of the human expert knowledge is particularly emphasized.

N2  - This article presents research aimed at developing and testing an online, multistakeholder decision-aiding framework for informing multiattribute risk management choices associated with energy development and climate change. The framework was designed to provide necessary background information and facilitate internally consistent choices, or choices that are in line with users? prioritized objectives. In order to test different components of the decision-aiding framework, a six-part, 2 ? 2 ? 2 factorial experiment was conducted, yielding eight treatment scenarios. The three factors included: (1) whether or not users could construct their own alternatives; (2) the level of detail regarding the composition of alternatives users would evaluate; and (3) the way in which a final choice between users? own constructed (or highest-ranked) portfolio and an internally consistent portfolio was presented. Participants? self-reports revealed the framework was easy to use and providing an opportunity to develop one's own risk-management alternatives (Factor 1) led to the highest knowledge gains. Empirical measures showed the internal consistency of users? decisions across all treatments to be lower than expected and confirmed that providing information about alternatives? composition (Factor 2) resulted in the least internally consistent choices. At the same time, those users who did not develop their own alternatives and were not shown detailed information about the composition of alternatives believed their choices to be the most internally consistent. These results raise concerns about how the amount of information provided and the ability to construct alternatives may inversely affect users? real and perceived internal consistency.

N2  - Abstract Goal Programming (GP) is applied to modelling the decision making processes in the well-known Ultimatum Game and some of its variations. The decision model for a player is a Chebychev GP model that balances her individual desires with the mental model she has of the desires of other relevant players. Fairness is modelled as a universal mechanism, allowing players to differ in their belief of what a fair solution should be in any particular game. The model's conceptual framework draws upon elements considered of importance in the field of cognitive neuroscience, and results from the field of psychology are used to further specify the types of goals in the model. Computer simulations of the GP models, testing a number of Ultimatum, Dictator and Double-Blind Dictator Games, lead to distributions of proposals made and accepted that correspond reasonably well with experimental findings.

N2  - Abstract This article describes an open source web-based visualization tool for exploring stakeholder conflicts in land-use planning. It implements a multi-criteria, decision-analytic framework which solves a conflict-constrained knapsack problem in order to find Pareto efficient combinations of actions which maximize public value, given the conflict constraint. The user interface is centered around an interactive map in which geographical subareas are color-shaded in proportion to the mean strength of preference for a particular chosen action within the population in the selected area. The aim of this work is to investigate the use of web technologies and formal problem-solving methods for improving public participation in land-use planning and support local governments in the pursuit of improved decision-making. The tool was developed using the free statistical programming language R and the web application framework Shiny. Its usefulness is demonstrated through a case study in Upplands Väsby municipality in Stockholm County, Sweden. The article ends with a summary together with some ideas for future research and development.

N2  - ABSTRACT Conservation decisions are challenging, not only because they often involve difficult conflicts among outcomes that people value, but because our understanding of the natural world and our effects on it is fraught with uncertainty. Value of Information (VoI) methods provide an approach for understanding and managing uncertainty from the standpoint of the decision maker. These methods are commonly used in other fields (e.g. economics, public health) and are increasingly used in biodiversity conservation. This decision-analytical approach can identify the best management alternative to select where the effectiveness of interventions is uncertain, and can help to decide when to act and when to delay action until after further research. We review the use of VoI in the environmental domain, reflect on the need for greater uptake of VoI, particularly for strategic conservation planning, and suggest promising areas for new research. We also suggest common reporting standards as a means of increasing the leverage of this powerful tool. The environmental science, ecology and biodiversity categories of the Web of Knowledge were searched using the terms ?Value of Information,? ?Expected Value of Perfect Information,? and the abbreviation ?EVPI.? Google Scholar was searched with the same terms, and additionally the terms decision and biology, biodiversity conservation, fish, or ecology. We identified 1225 papers from these searches. Included studies were limited to those that showed an application of VoI in biodiversity conservation rather than simply describing the method. All examples of use of VOI were summarised regarding the application of VoI, the management objectives, the uncertainties, the models used, how the objectives were measured, and the type of VoI. While the use of VoI appears to be on the increase in biodiversity conservation, the reporting of results is highly variable, which can make it difficult to understand the decision context and which uncertainties were considered. Moreover, it was unclear if, and how, the papers informed management and policy interventions, which is why we suggest a range of reporting standards that would aid the use of VoI. The use of VoI in conservation settings is at an early stage. There are opportunities for broader applications, not only for species-focussed management problems, but also for setting local or global research priorities for biodiversity conservation, making funding decisions, or designing or improving protected area networks and management. The long-term benefits of applying VoI methods to biodiversity conservation include a more structured and decision-focused allocation of resources to research.

N2  - Abstract System obsolescence issues are a routine occurrence, especially for systems with a high utilization of commercial electronic components or software applications with a long operational life. The extended length of a system's development can often result in obsolescence well before system production and fielding begins. Obsolescence affects individual electronic components and availability of materials, as well as access to experienced personnel, processes, and software. Legacy application software obsolescence is influenced by multiple factors. Included in these factors are hardware obsolescence, increased software maintenance, commercial off-the-shelf software obsolescence, growth in technical debt, growth in complexity, and a lack of embedded business rule documentation. These criteria influence subjective management decisions in the remediation of current or future obsolescence risk. A multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed to evaluate the impact of multiple obsolescence elements over the life cycle of a software application with consideration for the knowledge, preference, and subjectivity of experts to better inform the risk assessment and timing of future mitigation strategies. The resulting MCDM score provides a break point for a quantifiable increase in obsolescence risk.

N2  - Abstract Scenario planning has become detached from its roots in strategic management. The dominance of strategy process research and the search for links to performance and impact have pushed researchers away from strategy perspectives. While the cognitive stream of research has provided many insights, a practice approach is presented as an alternative theoretical perspective that reestablishes the role of strategy in a scenario planning process. Within a strategy-as-practice perspective, three areas of significance to practice-orientated scenario planning research emerge: situated practice, macro influences, and micro activities. Scholarly attention to these areas can enhance current theoretical and practical understanding of scenario planning.

N2  - The objective of this study is to analyse further the governance?performance relationship while improving on two methodological issues: control for endogeneity and firm performance measurement. To mitigate the endogeneity problem, we first focus on subsamples of firms for which we ex ante expect better corporate governance to cause better performance. Second, we use generalized least squares regressions for panel data. To control for potential measurement bias, we measure firm performance using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The research is conducted in Canada over a five-year period from 2001 to 2005. Corporate governance is measured based on the Report on Business corporate governance index published by the Globe and Mail. Overall, the results show that better governed firms are more efficient. This study is in line with a growing number of recent studies that propose alternative measures of firm performance. By using DEA, this study brings together the corporate finance and productivity literature.

N2  - ABSTRACT Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a methodology for prioritizing actions to mitigate the effects of failures in products and processes. Although originally used by product designers, FMEA is currently more widely used in industry in Six Sigma quality improvement efforts. Two prominent criticisms of the traditional application of FMEA are that the risk priority number (RPN) used to rank failure modes is an invalid measure according to measurement theory, and that the RPN does not weight the three decision criteria used in FMEA. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate these concerns, including many using fuzzy logic. We develop a new ranking method in this article using a data-elicitation technique. Furthermore, we develop an efficient means of eliciting data to reduce the effort associated with the new method. Subsequently, we conduct an experimental study to evaluate that proposed method against the traditional method using RPN and against an approach using fuzzy logic.

N2  - ABSTRACT This paper proposes an additive measure on the basis of compromise programming to evaluate fund performance from multiple criteria, of which the most usual are profitability and risk. This proposal is motivated by the fact that compromise programming is a sound decision support model to obtain scores of alternatives by minimizing weighted distances to an ideal point, the weights reflecting the investor's preferences for the criteria. To define the distance objective function, the linear-quadratic composite metric is used, which combines advantages of linear and non-linear objective functions. A critical advantage of compromise programming for fund performance evaluation is that the model can be extended to more than two financial criteria while other measures currently used (either ratio-based or leverage-based measures) only consider two criteria, say, profitability and risk. In the application, three investor's profiles are defined, which involve different weighting systems and lead to different fund rankings. These rankings are compared with domination relationships, the latter formulating if a fund is dominated or non-dominated by convex combinations of other funds. Numerical tables are provided with data, computational process and results, which are analysed. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Canada is the world's largest producer of maple syrup. Syrup production depends on weather and climatic conditions of the sugarbush. However, forest ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change. The effect of rapidly changing precipitation and temperature patterns on tree species is of concern as these long-lived organisms cannot quickly adapt to the new environmental conditions in which they find themselves. As temperatures increase it is expected that there will be a change in species' ranges poleward. This study uses Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and Geographic Information System (GIS) weighted sum analysis to project near future (2050) and distant future (2100) suitability maps of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) habitat in Ontario associated with three different Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) scenarios. Our maps project an overall decrease in the amount of suitable habitat within the current sugar maple range under the scenarios modelled, which intensifies in the later time period. Furthermore there is a projected shift in central and southern Ontario from a region dominated by suitable habitat to one dominated by unsuitable habitat.

N2  - Modelling and simulation (M&S) is increasingly being applied in (clinical) drug development. It provides an opportune area for the community of pharmaceutical statisticians to pursue. In this article, we highlight useful principles behind the application of M&S. We claim that M&S should be focussed on decisions, tailored to its purpose and based in applied sciences, not relying entirely on data-driven statistical analysis. Further, M&S should be a continuous process making use of diverse information sources and applying Bayesian and frequentist methodology, as appropriate. In addition to forming a basis for analysing decision options, M&S provides a framework that can facilitate communication between stakeholders. Besides the discussion on modelling philosophy, we also describe how standard simulation practice can be ineffective and how simulation efficiency can often be greatly improved.

N2  - Objective To generate a core set of items to develop classification criteria for scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) using consensus methodology. Methods An international, multidisciplinary panel of experts was invited to participate in a 3-round Delphi exercise developed using a survey based on items identified by a scoping review. In round 1, participants were asked to identify omissions and clarify ambiguities regarding the items in the survey. In round 2, participants were asked to rate the validity and feasibility of the items using Likert-type scales ranging from 1 to 9 (where 1 = very invalid/unfeasible, 5 = uncertain, and 9 = very valid/feasible). In round 3, participants reviewed the results and comments from round 2 and were asked to provide final ratings. Items rated as highly valid and feasible (median scores ≥7 for each) in round 3 were selected as the provisional core set of items. A consensus meeting using a nominal group technique was conducted to further reduce the core set of items. Results Ninety-nine experts from 16 countries participated in the Delphi exercise. Of the 31 items in the survey, consensus was achieved on 13, in the categories hypertension, renal insufficiency, proteinuria, and hemolysis. Eleven experts took part in the nominal group technique discussion, where consensus was achieved in 5 domains: blood pressure, acute kidney injury, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, target organ dysfunction, and renal histopathology. Conclusion A core set of items that characterize SRC was identified using consensus methodology. This core set will be used in future data-driven phases of this project to develop classification criteria for SRC.

N2  - SummaryIn this paper, we formalize the defect-prediction problem as a multiobjective optimization problem. Specifically, we propose an approach, coined as multiobjective defect predictor (MODEP), based on multiobjective forms of machine learning techniques?logistic regression and decision trees specifically?trained using a genetic algorithm. The multiobjective approach allows software engineers to choose predictors achieving a specific compromise between the number of likely defect-prone classes or the number of defects that the analysis would likely discover (effectiveness), and lines of code to be analysed/tested (which can be considered as a proxy of the cost of code inspection). Results of an empirical evaluation on 10 datasets from the PROMISE repository indicate the quantitative superiority of MODEP with respect to single-objective predictors, and with respect to trivial baseline ranking classes by size in ascending or descending order. Also, MODEP outperforms an alternative approach for cross-project prediction, based on local prediction upon clusters of similar classes. Copyright ? 2015?John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract Some of the existing park-level integrated energy systems (PIESs) experience problems such as mismatch between energy supply and demand, high operation costs, and low renewable energy consumption capacity. To improve the energy supply level of the existing PIES, the multi-scene upgrade and renovation method of the existing PIES based on comprehensive analysis is proposed. First, the physical model of the existing PIES for renovation is constructed, including expansion of existing equipment and newly added candidate equipment. Second, to determine the deficiencies, the current situation of the existing PIES is analysed based on the planning and operation data as well as indexes including economy, photovoltaic consumption capacity, and so on. On this basis, multiple renovation scenes are set up, and the upgrade and renovation model is constructed, assuming minimal investment, operation, and maintenance costs to be the objective function. Thereafter, the equipment allocation scheme of each scene is solved, for which comprehensive evaluation is performed. Finally, considering an existing PIES as an example, the weak energy storage and heating links are upgraded and renovated, effectively improving the performance of the existing PIES in reducing costs and carbon emissions, and improving energy utilisation efficiency.

N2  - Abstract Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used to study geographic distributions of taxa in response to natural and anthropogenic environmental conditions. For a community, common approaches include fitting individual SDMs (iSDMs) to all taxa or directly modelling community properties such as richness. However, the parameters of iSDMs are difficult to identify for rare taxa, and community properties do not reveal taxon-specific responses. Individual models can be combined into a hierarchical multispecies distribution model (mSDM) that constrains taxon-specific parameters according to overarching community parameters, or a joint model (jSDM) in which interdependencies between taxa are jointly inferred. We compare how individual, hierarchical multispecies and joint SDMs differ in quality of fit, explanatory power and predictive performance, and analyse how these properties depend on the prevalence of taxa. Taxa Presence?absence observations of 245 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa identified at a mixed taxonomic resolution. Location Four hundred and ninety-two sites in rivers throughout Switzerland. Methods Individual, hierarchical and joint hierarchical generalized linear models (GLM) were developed for all taxa. Parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian inference with Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. Predictive performance was assessed with cross-validation. In addition, the predicted family and species richness of the models was compared with a GLM for richness. Results Individual models show a slightly higher quality of fit largely due to overfitting for rare taxa. The mSDM achieves a similar quality of fit and explanatory power, mitigates overfitting for rare taxa and considerably improves predictive performance over the whole community. The joint models further improve the quality of fit, but decrease predictive performance and increase predictive uncertainty. Main conclusions We show that even a relatively simple mSDM combines many of the analytical capabilities of iSDMs and improves predictive performance. Increasingly complex mSDMs and jSDMs provide additional analytical possibilities, but depending on the data and research questions, different levels of complexity may be appropriate.

N2  - Often from multi-indicator system (MIS), a composite indicator is derived by applying weighted sums of the single indicators. The eventual ranking being based on composite indicator yields a total (linear) ranking. In contrast, partial order ranking constitutes an alternative approach where assumptions about linearity or distribution of the indicators are not needed and indicators are in general used without quantification of mutual preferences. The present paper describes analyses of MIS based on a series of partial order techniques as offered by the PyHasse software. The paper describes how important information on an MIS can be obtained without lengthy and often controversial and possible subjective discussions about indicator weights and thus avoiding both covering up valuable information contained in the single indicators as well as unwanted compensation effects. The application of partial order for obtaining chemometric information is illustrated by a study of 12 chloro-organic pesticides. All calculation has been carried out applying the experimental software PyHasse. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract Evidence (?data?) is at the heart of EFSA's 2020 Strategy and is addressed in three of its operational objectives: (1) adopt an open data approach, (2) improve data interoperability to facilitate data exchange, and (3) migrate towards structured scientific data. As the generation and availability of data have increased exponentially in the last decade, potentially providing a much larger evidence base for risk assessments, it is envisaged that the acquisition and management of evidence to support future food safety risk assessments will be a dominant feature of EFSA's future strategy. During the breakout session on ?Managing evidence? of EFSA's third Scientific Conference ?Science, Food, Society?, current challenges and future developments were discussed in evidence management applied to food safety risk assessment, accounting for the increased volume of evidence available as well as the increased IT capabilities to access and analyse it. This paper reports on presentations given and discussions held during the session, which were centred around the following three main topics: (1) (big) data availability and (big) data connection, (2) problem formulation and (3) evidence integration.

N2  - Abstract Health 3.0 is a health-related extension of the Web 3.0 concept. It is based on the semantic Web which provides for semantically organizing electronic health records of individuals. Health 3.0 is rapidly gaining ground as a new research topic in many academic and industrial disciplines. Due to the recent rapid spread of wearable sensors and smart devices with access to social media, migrating health services from the traditional centre-based health system to personal health care is inevitable. In this current era of greater personalization, treating patients' health problems according to their profile and medical data gathered is possible using the latest information technologies. Consequently, personalized health recommender systems have gained importance. Empowering the utility of advanced Web technology in personalized health systems is still challenging due to pressing issues, such as lack of low cost and accurate smart medical sensors and wearable devices, existing investment in legacy Web system architecture in health sector, heterogeneity of medical data gathered by myriad health care institutions and isolated health services, and interoperability issues as well as multi-dimensionality of medical data. By tracing recent developments, this paper offers a systematic review through recent research on semantic Web-enabled personalized health systems, namely, semanticized personalized health recommender systems with the key enabling technologies, major applications, and successful case studies. Critical questions derived from the research studies were discussed, and main directions of open issues were identified leading to recommendations for future study in the field of personalized health recommender systems.

The compatible (Noise F, Input VSWR Vi, Gain GT) triplets and their (ZS, ZL) terminations of a microwave transistor are exploited for an amplifier design with the minimum noise Fmin(f), required gain GTreq(f), and a low input VSWR Vi over the available bandwidth. The multi-objective design procedure is obtained from ZS(f), ZL(f) terminations with the unit-elements and short-circuited stubs in the L+L configurations and memetic optimization algorithm is successfully implemented as an optimization tool. A typical design example is given with its challenging performance in the simple L+L configurations realizable by the microstrip line technology. ? 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - In the last decade, social media platforms have become important communication channels between businesses and consumers. As a result, a lot of consumer-generated data are available online. Unfortunately, they are not fully utilized, partly because of their nature: they are unstructured, subjective, and exist in massive databases. To make use of these data, more than one research method is needed. This study proposes a new, multiple approach to social media data analysis, which counteracts the aforementioned characteristics of social media data. In this new approach the data are first extracted systematically and coded following the principles of content analysis, after a comprehensive literature review has been conducted to guide the coding strategy. Next, the relationships between codes are identified by statistical cluster analysis. These relationships are used in the next step of the analysis, where evaluation criteria weights are derived on the basis of the social media data through probability weighting function. A case study is employed to test the proposed approach.

N2  - ABSTRACT The key successful factors (KSFs) of knowledge management for university students using e-portfolio were established in the present study based on the Fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). According to experts, the KSFs of KM using e-portfolio included knowledge sharing, innovation, acquisition, application, and accumulation. Detailed sub-KSFs were developed based on the activities of the e-portfolios including reflection, work revision, self-assessment on works, arrangement of learning content, teacher feedback, modeling, communication, and discussion. Each KSF and sub-KSF was weighted and ranked and had an acceptable reliability and validity. Among these sub-KSFs, reflection had the highest weight, followed by work revision, implying that reflection had the greatest impact on knowledge management. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Comput.

N2  - Abstract Investors generally learn from historical data and use it to improve future investment decisions. However, existing portfolio selection research rarely considers such a concept. This paper proposes a novel approach to the combinatorial portfolio selection problem. Our solution employs the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) approach with ELECTRE III, based on the Industry Classification Benchmark standards. The target stocks are ranked based on their similarities to a reference case, allowing specified selection criteria. Similarities are calculated based on selected ELECTRE III metrics. Experimental results with the Stock Exchange of Thailand data show that our CBR approach with ELECTRE III outperforms the traditional method.

N2  - Layered defenses are necessary for protecting the public from terrorist attacks. Designing a system of such defensive measures requires consideration of the interaction of these countermeasures. In this article, we present an analysis of a layered security system within the lower Manhattan area. It shows how portfolios of security measures can be evaluated through portfolio decision analysis. Consideration is given to the total benefits and costs of the system. Portfolio diagrams are created that help communicate alternatives among stakeholders who have differing views on the tradeoffs between security and economic activity.

N2  - Abstract To obtain greater profit, insurance firms not only need to provide attractive insurance products but also effectively promote their products. A growing number of insurance companies have thus heavily invested in marketing. Therefore, the proposed assessment framework integrates the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process and the improved fuzzy modified technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (improved fuzzy modified TOPSIS) to acquire the efficiency scores of the alternatives (i.e. insurance companies) being evaluated. The improved fuzzy modified TOPSIS computes efficiency scores of insurance companies based on the Mahalanobis distances, taking into account the fuzzy correlations between the indicators and the weighted distance of fuzzy modified TOPSIS. The advantage of calculating the Mahalanobis distances over the Euclidean distances, which are typically used in the literature, is that the undulation of efficiency scores can be decreased. The assessment criteria have high correlations with each other. This assessment framework is applied to appraise the marketing performance of four major insurance companies in Taiwan. The assessment and comparison results are proved to be consistent with those published by an independent business survey institute.

N2  - ABSTRACT The group ranking problem involves constructing coherent aggregated results from users? preference data. The goal of most group ranking problems is to generate an ordered list of all items that represents the user consensus. There are, however, two weaknesses to this approach. First, a complete list of ranked items is always output even when there is no consensus or only a slight consensus. Second, due to similarity of performance, in many practical situations, it is very difficult to differentiate whether one item is really better than another within a set. These weaknesses have motivated us to apply the clustering concept to the group ranking problem, to output an ordered list of segments containing a set of similarly preferred items, called consensus ordered segments. The advantages of our approach are that (i) the list of segments is based on the users? consensuses, (ii) the items with similar preferences are grouped together in the same segment, and (iii) the relationships between items can be easily seen. An algorithm is developed to construct the consensus of the ordered segments from the users? total ranking data. Finally, the experimental results indicate that the proposed method is computationally efficient, and can effectively identify consensus ordered segments.

N2  - Abstract In today's highly competitive air transportation environment, the quality of airport service is an important issue. In this paper, we present a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method for the evaluation of the quality of airport service. The data are collected from the passengers who depart from two international airports in Taiwan. The fuzzy MCDM model is defuzzied using the inverse function arithmetic representation method. The results show that the average quality of the Taoyuan International Airport service is better than that of the Kaohsiung International Airport service. This paper also analyses the quality of airport service using the fuzzy expert system to improve the performance of airport service. The analysis results show that the Kaohsiung International Airport and the Taoyuan International Airports' improvement efforts should be concentrated on seven and five specific service items, respectively. The findings of this paper are to help the decision-makers and the managers of airports improve the quality of airport service.

N2  - The strategic use of intellectual property (IP) is crucial for technology-based companies to gain competitive advantage. The recent transformation of the US patent system brings new challenges and opportunities in this arena. In this regard, this study attempts to identify techniques which can help with IP evaluation and selection in the fuzzy front end (FFE) of new product development (NPD) process. This study combines data collection methods such as mining the literature, conducting in-depth interviews, surveying questionnaires, and analyzing cases. This research serves as an analysis of modern literature and identifies a multicriteria weighted scoring model that can be employed to help with the patent decision process. The criterion to discern patent eligibility is a contended discussion. For this survey administration, 300 companies, as the targeted sample, were randomly selected to be reached from LexisNexis database. Consequently, this paper identifies the key decision criteria to incorporate into this model and obtains weights gathered from surveying IP professionals and R&D managers in US-based electronics manufacturing firms (SIC code: 36). This study proposes a structured approach to identify ideas that should be patented in the FFE of NPD process by way of an analysis of pertaining literature and case studies. The technique we present in this paper could be essential for many firms to achieve IP success as their strategic means. Moreover, this tool can help R&D managers not only speed up the FFE of NPD process but also make more informed and target-worthy decisions for IP filing.

N2  - Abstract Context Technical debt refers to the consequences of taking shortcuts when developing software. These consequences can impede the software growth and have financial implications. The software engineering research community needs to explore technical debt further from a practitioner standpoint. Objective This study gathers insights from practitioners on key components of technical debt such as its definition, characterization, consequences, benefits, and how it is communicated. Method We conducted semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 17 practitioners and a survey of 67 participants. Results Despite the lack of consensus, we identified the most commonly accepted definition, method to measure technical debt (as person hours), and method to reduce debt (by allocating time in iterations to address the debt). Defects were also identified as type of debt and the cost of technical debt is more than the cost to make changes to source code. Three distinct company profiles emerged. Conclusion Despite increasing research on technical debt, the field lacks consensus on its many facets. One interesting outcome of this study is how to assess the risks of technical debt by evaluating liabilities beyond costs of directly handling debt.

N2  - Abstract EFSA requested the Scientific Committee to develop a guidance document on the use of the weight of evidence approach in scientific assessments for use in all areas under EFSA's remit. The guidance document addresses the use of weight of evidence approaches in scientific assessments using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Several case studies covering the various areas under EFSA's remit are annexed to the guidance document to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Weight of evidence assessment is defined in this guidance as a process in which evidence is integrated to determine the relative support for possible answers to a question. This document considers the weight of evidence assessment as comprising three basic steps: (1) assembling the evidence into lines of evidence of similar type, (2) weighing the evidence, (3) integrating the evidence. The present document identifies reliability, relevance and consistency as three basic considerations for weighing evidence.

N2  - Summary One of the most important factors to determine the success of an organization is the quality of decisions made. Supporting a decision-making process is a complex task, mainly when decision-makers are dispersed. Group decision support systems (GDSSs) have been studied over the last decades with the goal of providing support to decision-makers; however, their acceptance by organizations has been difficult. This happens mostly due to usability problems, loss of interaction between decision-makers, and consequently, loss of information. In this work, we present a web-based GDSS developed to support groups of decision-makers, regardless of their geographic location. The system allows the creation of multicriteria problems and the configuration of the preferences, intentions, and interests of each decision-maker. The presented system uses a multiagent system to combine and process this information, using virtual agents that represent each decision-maker. We believe that, with this approach, we will proceed in the refinements of a successful GDSS to correctly support decision-makers while preserving the valuable intelligence and knowledge that can be generated in face-to-face meetings. Furthermore, the high level of usability that the system provides will contribute to an easier acceptance and adoption of this kind of systems.

N2  - The rapid growth of ?big data? provides tremendous opportunities for making better decisions, where ?better? can be defined using any combination of economic, environmental, or social metrics. This essay provides a few examples of how the use of big data can precipitate more sustainable decision-making. However, as with any technology, the use of big data on a large scale will have some undesirable consequences. Some of these are foreseeable, while others are entirely unpredictable. This essay highlights some of the sustainability-related challenges posed by the use of big data. It does not intend to suggest that the advent of big data is an undesirable development. However, it is not too early to start asking what the unwanted repercussions of the big data revolution might be.

N2  - Abstract This study presents a literature analysis using a semiautomated text mining and topic modelling approach of the body of knowledge encompassed in 17 years (2000?2016) of literature published in the Wiley's Expert Systems journal, a key reference in Expert Systems (ESs) research, in a total of 488 research articles. The methodological approach included analysing countries from authors' affiliations, with results emphasizing the relevance of both U.S. and U.K. researchers, with Chinese, Turkish, and Spanish holding also a significant relevance. As a result of the sparsity found on the keywords, one of our goals became to devise a taxonomy for future submissions under 2 core dimensions: ESs' methods and ESs' applications. Finally, through topic modelling, data-driven methods were unveiled as the most relevant, pairing with evaluation methods in its application to managerial sciences, arts, and humanities. Findings also show that most of the application domains are well represented, including health, engineering, energy, and social sciences.

N2  - Summary The positive impact of the complementarity between renewable generation sources has been presented in several studies, but this concept has been neglected in many studies of expansion planning. This paper presents a new approach to introduce the complementarity between renewable energy resources and regions into the expansion planning for 100% renewable energy systems. A novel objective function is proposed to optimize the electricity mix and the water flow of hydropower reservoirs, considering the daily and yearly variations. A case study is presented with the objective of assessing the optimum mix (for the complementarity perspective) between solar, wind, hydro, and biomass power to ensure the expected monthly and hourly energy demand for Brazil in 2050. In the Brazilian case, when the complementarity between regions was considered, it was possible to ensure the electricity demand increase without new large reservoirs and with a high contribution from all renewable generation sources. A mix to ensure the daily and annual demand in 2050, which promotes the best complementarity, is presented, resulting in a share of 27%, 16%, 34%, and 23% for photovoltaic, wind, hydro, and biomass power, respectively.

N2  - It is often necessary to compose a team consisting of experts with diverse competencies to accomplish complex tasks. However, for its proper functioning, it is also preferable that a team be socially cohesive. A team recommendation system, which facilitates the search for potential team members, can be of great help both for (a) individuals who need to seek out collaborators and for (b) managers who need to build a team for some specific tasks. Such a decision support system that readily helps summarize multiple metrics indicating a team (and its members) quality, and possibly rank the teams in a personalized manner according to the end users' preferences, thus serves as a tool to cope with what would otherwise be an information avalanche. In this work, we present Social Web Application for Team Recommendation, a general-purpose framework to compose various information retrieval and social graph mining and visualization subsystems together to build a composite team recommendation system, and instantiate it for a case study of academic teams.

N2  - Summary The Internet of Things is underpinned by the global penetration of network-connected smart devices continuously generating extreme amounts of raw data to be processed in a timely manner. Supported by Cloud and Fog/Edge infrastructures ? on the one hand, and Big Data processing techniques ? on the other, existing approaches, however, primarily adopt a vertical offloading model that is heavily dependent on the underlying network bandwidth. That is, (constrained) network communication remains the main limitation to achieve truly agile IoT data management and processing. This paper aims to bridge this gap by defining Clustered Edge Computing ? a new approach to enable rapid data processing at the very edge of the IoT network by clustering edge devices into fully functional decentralized ensembles, capable of workload distribution and balancing to accomplish relatively complex computational tasks. This paper also proposes ECStream Processing that implements Clustered Edge Computing using Stream Processing techniques to enable dynamic in-memory computation close to the data source. By spreading the workload among a cluster of collocated edge devices to process data in parallel, the proposed approach aims to improve performance, thereby supporting agile data management. The experimental results confirm that such a distributed in-memory approach to data processing at the very edge of an IoT network can outperform currently adopted Cloud-enabled architectures, and has the potential to address a wide range of IoT-related data-intensive time-critical scenarios.

N2  - ABSTRACT An experiment compared asynchronous versus synchronous instruction in an online quantitative course. Mann-Whitley U-tests, correlation, analysis of variance, t tests, and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) were utilized to test the hypothesis that more high-quality online experiential learning interactions would increase grade. Quasi-experimental controls included prior ability and demographic factors (gender, age). The control group used asynchronous discussion forums while the test group held synchronous sessions in Skype (chat, audio, and document sharing). A statistically significant MANCOVA model was created, using teaching method as a factor, and a count of online interactions (as a covariate), with assessment timing (as a blocking factor), to measure effect on grade.

N2  - The exhaustive nature of fossil fuels and environmental concerns associated with greenhouse gases are the major causes of the paradigm shift from conventional vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs). The electrification of the transportation sector and the increasing popularity of the EVs have driven scientists and researchers to delve into charging stations. Underdeveloped charging infrastructure, optimal placement of charging stations, and charge scheduling in the charging stations are the major concerns for the large-scale deployment of EVs. Even few questions related to EVs, such as the vehicle price and driving range, can be partially solved with a well-developed charging infrastructure. Existing old infrastructure may bring severe limitations in the realization of the optimal placement of charging stations as EVs have not existed when the road and grid infrastructure have been developed. For the past few years, the studies associated with the optimal placement and sizing of EV charging stations have drawn the consideration of the researchers. The researchers have used different approaches, objective functions, and applied different optimization algorithms while dealing with the problem of charging station placement. The complex and dynamic nature of the problem has led researchers to apply different optimization algorithms for the solution of the problem. In this particular review study, the research works bearing on the charging infrastructure planning for the EVs are considered. Thus, this review work will endow the research community with the latest developments and research findings in the paradigm of charging infrastructure planning for EVs.

N2  - Abstract Vector-borne diseases inflict a heavy health burden. Numerous vector species have expanded their ranges while some vector-borne diseases have emerged in new geographic areas or reemerged in former endemic areas, potentially due to global climate change. The continued health burden and the expansion in vector and vector-borne disease ranges have led to an increased need for understanding and predicting in space and time the potential abundance and distribution of vectors and the transmission of vector-borne diseases. Advances in computing technologies, increased spatial data availability, and greater understanding of ecological drivers have made it commonplace to attempt to understand and estimate, in time and space, vector populations and vector-borne disease incidence. Although there have been great advances there are still limitations due to complex and varying ecologies and epidemiological contexts of vector-borne diseases as well as data limitations. In this paper, we will provide an overview of and examine advances and limitations in the use of geospatial technologies for understanding and prediction of the drivers of vector populations and vector-borne diseases.

N2  - Abstract Industry 4.0, the new vision of our age has forced companies to transform their processes. In the process of transition to Industry 4.0, one of the most crucial success factors is to select the project portfolio that best fits their objectives. The uncertainty included in the projects, the interproject priority, and various interdependence relations, interactions between project evaluation criteria, decision makers with different perspectives, and preferences make Industry 4.0 project portfolio selection decision considerably complicated. In this study, a two-stage fuzzy approach is proposed to address this complex problem. In the first stage of the approach, the main criteria and subcriteria to be used in evaluating the Industry 4.0 projects have been determined based on the literature review and expert opinions. Following this, a network structure representing outer and inner dependencies has been formed, and the priority weights of the criteria have been obtained by taking into consideration these dependencies. Then, each of the project alternatives has been evaluated under subcriteria, and desirability indexes of project alternatives have been calculated. Fuzzy analytic network process has been applied in this stage. In the second stage, fuzzy multi-objective nonlinear programming has been used to select a project portfolio. In the application of the first stage of the proposed methodology, experts from three firms, which have made significant progress in the Industry 4.0 implementation process, are the decision makers. In the application of the second stage, hypothetically created project alternatives and their dataset have been used.

N2  - Abstract An important issue in lake and reservoir management is to prevent algal proliferation and its problematic symptom: the algal blooms that deteriorate water quality and ruin its use. The aim of this study was to obtain a predictive model able to perform an early detection of algal abnormal proliferation using as a predictor the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration of previous days. For this purpose, some biological parameters (phytoplankton species expressed in biovolume) in addition to the most important chemical and physical?chemical parameters were considered. The implementation of the statistical learning method known as support vector machines (SVMs) allowed us to predict the Chl a concentration, one of the most frequently used estimators of algal biomass, and to study its evolution in the Trasona reservoir (Principality of Asturias, Northern Spain). In the first place, the main goal was to obtain the dependence relationship of chlorophyll concentration as a function of not only several chemical and physical?chemical variables but also the biological ones. This dependence relationship was useful in setting the significance order of the variables involved in the Chl a prediction. Secondly, a model for forecasting the algal abnormal proliferation is obtained. The agreement between experimental data and the model confirmed the good performance of the latter. Finally, conclusions of this innovative research work are exposed. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract The primary goal of this study was to propose an algorithm using mathematical programming to detect earnings management practices. In order to evaluate the ability of this proposed algorithm, the traditional statistical models are used as a benchmark vis-à-vis their time series counterparts. As emerging techniques in the area of mathematical programming yield better results, application of suitable models is expected to result in highly performed forecasts. The motivation behind this paper is to develop an algorithm which will succeed in detecting companies that appeal to financial manipulation. The methodology is based on cutting plane formulation using mathematical programming. A sample of 126 Turkish manufacturing firms described over 10 financial ratios and indexes are used for detecting factors associated with false financial statements. The results indicate that the proposed three-phase cutting plane algorithm outperforms the traditional statistical techniques which are widely used for false financial statement detections. Furthermore, the results indicate that the investigation of financial information can be helpful towards the identification of false financial statements and highlight the importance of financial ratios/indexes such as Days' Sales in Receivables Index (DSRI), Gross Margin Index (GMI), Working Capital Accruals to Total Assets (TATA) and Days to Inventory Index (DINV).?Copyright ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract Timely and effective emergency decision making (EDM) is the key to control the spread of disasters and reduce the casualties and property losses caused by emergencies. However, due to limited time and insufficient data, it is difficult for decision makers to provide accurate information about emergency incidents. Moreover, the EDM problems become complicated and unstructured requiring the deployment of advanced mathematical techniques to derive the most acceptable response. In this paper, we propose a new EDM approach by using picture fuzzy sets and axiomatic design technique for determining the optimal rescue plan to reduce the damages of emergencies. The contribution of this paper is to apply the picture fuzzy sets to handle the uncertainty and ambiguity of decision makers' assessments on emergency alternatives, apply the picture fuzzy hybrid averaging operator to aggregate decision makers' opinions into a group evaluation matrix and extend the axiomatic design technique to identify the best emergency solution for EDM. Finally, a real example is provided, and the result is compared with existing methods to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of our proposed EDM approach.

N2  - Abstract: This is a pioneer study that presents two branches of computational intelligence techniques, namely linear genetic programming (LGP) and radial basis function (RBF) neural network to build models for bankruptcy prediction. The main goal is to classify samples of 140 bankrupt and non-bankrupt Iranian corporations by means LGP and RBF. Another important contribution of this paper is to identify the effective predictive financial ratios based on an extensive bankruptcy prediction literature review and a sequential feature selection analysis. In order to benchmark the proposed models, a log?log regression analysis is further performed. A comparative study on the classification accuracy of the LGP, RBF and regression-based models is conducted. The results indicate that the proposed models effectively let estimate any enterprise in the aspect of bankruptcy. The LGP models have a significantly better prediction performance in comparison with the RBF and regression models.

N2  - The Earth's future depends on how we manage the manifold risks of climate change (CC). It is state-of-the-art to assume that risk reduction requires participatory management involving a broad range of stakeholders and scientists. However, there is still little knowledge about the optimal design of participatory climate change risk management processes (PRMPs), in particular with respect to considering the multitude of substantial uncertainties that are relevant for PRMPs. To support the many local to regional PRMPs that are necessary for a successful global-scale reduction of CC risks, we present a roadmap for designing such transdisciplinary knowledge integration processes. The roadmap suggests ways in which uncertainties can be comprehensively addressed within a PRMP. We discuss the concept of CC risks and their management and propose an uncertainty framework that distinguishes epistemic, ontological, and linguistic uncertainty as well as ambiguity. Uncertainties relevant for CC risk management are identified. Communicative and modeling methods that support social learning as well as the development of risk management strategies are proposed for each of six phases of a PRMP. Finally, we recommend how to evaluate PRMPs as such evaluations and their publication are paramount for achieving a reduction of CC risks.

N2  - Abstract Purpose Currently, there is no qualified understanding of the influences, behaviours and other factors that impact the decision-making of individuals and organisations involved in the development of new medicines. The aim of this qualitative study was to investigate and identify the important issues that influence quality decision-making. Methods Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 29 senior decision-makers from the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities. The study participants were invited to discuss and review their perception of decision-making within their organisation, its role in drug development and the regulatory review and their awareness and use of decision-making techniques and the impact and monitoring of decisions. Results The analyses (using NVivo 8? software) resulted in the identification of 32 major and 97 sub-themes that were consolidated into 19 overarching themes. These included items such as quality and validity of data, time considerations, organisational and cultural influences, analytical and logical approach, qualification and experience, subjective and personal considerations, political influences, precedents for similar previous decisions, understanding of the decision in question, impact analyses, audit trail, education and awareness, individual versus corporate decision-making and frameworks. Relationships between themes were identified. The 19 overarching decision-making themes were integrated into a framework for quality decision-making. Conclusion This study has achieved its aim of exploring decision-making from the perspective of the individual and the organisation working in drug development and the regulatory review and has identified issues and considerations relating to making good quality decisions and allowed for the generation of a framework to aid quality decision-making.

N2  - Abstract This paper addresses one of the key objectives of the supply chain strategic design phase, that is, the optimal selection of suppliers. A methodology for supplier selection under uncertainty is proposed, integrating the cross-efficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA) and Monte Carlo approach. The combination of these two techniques allows overcoming the deterministic feature of the classical cross-efficiency DEA approach. Moreover, we define an indicator of the robustness of the determined supplier ranking. The technique is able to manage the supplier selection problem considering nondeterministic input and output data. It allows the evaluation of suppliers under uncertainty, a particularly significant circumstance for the assessment of potential suppliers. The novel approach helps buyers in choosing the right partners under uncertainty and ranking suppliers upon a multiple sourcing strategy, even when considering complex evaluations with a high number of suppliers and many input and output criteria.

N2  - Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia occurring in 2% of the general population, while the assuming projected incidence in 2050 will rise to 4.3%. This paper presents a multicriteria methodology for the development of a model for monitoring the post-operative behaviour of patients who have received treatment for AF. The model classifies the patients in seven categories according to their relapse risk, on the basis of seven criteria related to the AF type and pathology conditions, the treatment received by the patients and their medical history. The analysis is based on an extension of the UTilités Additives DIScriminantes (UTADIS) method, through the introduction of a two-stage model development procedure that minimizes the number and the magnitude of the misclassifications. The analysis is based on a sample of 116 patients who had pulmonary veins isolation in a Greek public hospital. The classification accuracy of the best fitted models scores between 71% and 84%.

N2  - ABSTRACT Rating models are widely used by credit institutions to obtain estimates for the probabilities of default for their clients (firms, organizations, individuals) and to assess the risk of credit portfolios. Several statistical and data mining methods are used to develop such models. In this article, the potential of an outranking multicriteria decision-aiding approach is explored. An evolutionary algorithm is used to fit a credit rating model on the basis of the ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la REalité trichotomique method. The methodology is applied to a large sample of Greek firms. The results indicate that outranking models are well suited to credit rating, providing good classification results and useful insight on the relative importance of the evaluation criteria.

N2  - Summary Policy decisions about the approval and funding of new cancer drugs must often be made in an environment of complex uncertainty about clinical and cost-effectiveness data. The focus of this article is on the results from qualitative interviews with senior officials (n = 16) who make decisions about or influence cancer drug policy in various organizations in the Canadian cancer control system. Most participants identified the use of a limited number of informal approaches to address uncertainty, such as grounding decisions in evidence and advice from expert groups. People tended to focus on evidence informed decisions including price negotiations, the ability to implement policy changes, and stakeholder values. Lessons from the Canadian context related to continuing efforts to build a public culture of understanding into how policy decisions like cancer drug funding are made may result in greater acceptance and increased confidence in health policy decision-making processes across multiple sectors internationally.

N2  - Abstract Studies of sustainable urban infrastructure are expanding since the United Nations proposed the concept of sustainability in 1982. The need for more sustainable urban infrastructures led to many research efforts on innovative technologies and development strategies. We analyzed research progress on sustainable urban infrastructure from 1991 to 2017 using bibliometric, keyword co-occurrence and document cocitation network analysis. An increasing publication number suggests a rapid development of the sustainable urban infrastructure research area, but the development is still in an emerging stage. With respect to the analysis of research themes, we analyzed keyword co-occurrence networks in the three stages of 1991-1999, 2000-2008, and 2009-2017. We observed substantial expansions and intensive interconnections of research theme clusters on sustainable urban infrastructure. The themes from 2009 to 2017 include ?critical infrastructure,? ?urban planning and design,? ?development need,? ?technology innovation,? and ?cyber-physical system.? The United States produced 28.93% of the publications and played a core role in the international collaboration network. We further compared national interests among top productive countries, which highlights different priorities of investing more sustainable urban infrastructures. Finally, we presented an in-depth analysis of four emerging technology innovations, namely, renewable energy, smart grid, green infrastructure, and cloud computing regarding research directions and challenges. Our results not only provide a valuable reference for researchers who are interested in sustainable urban infrastructures but also put forward the emphasis and orientations of future studies.

N2  - Abstract: Decision makers always lay great emphasis on performance evaluation upon a group of peer business units to pick out the best performer. Standard data envelopment analysis models can evaluate the relative efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) and distinguish efficient ones from inefficient ones. However, when there are more than one efficient DMU, it is impossible to rank all of them solely according to standard efficiency scores. In this paper, a new method for fully ranking all DMUs is proposed, which is based on the combination of each efficient DMU's influence on all the other DMUs and the standard efficiency scores. This method is effective in helping decision makers differentiate all units' performance thoroughly and select the best performer.

N2  - Abstract Generalized orthopair fuzzy sets are extensions of ordinary fuzzy sets by relaxing restrictions on the degrees of support for and support against. Correlation analysis is to measure the statistical relationships between two samples or variables. In this paper, we propose a function measuring the interrelation of two -rung orthopair fuzzy sets, whose range is the unit interval . First, the correlation and correlation coefficient of -rung orthopair membership grades are presented, and their basic properties are investigated. Second, these concepts are extended to -rung orthopair fuzzy sets on discrete universes. Then, we discuss their applications in cluster analysis under generalized orthopair fuzzy environments. And, a real-world problem involving the evaluation of companies is used to illustrate the detailed processes of the clustering algorithm. Finally, we introduce the correlation and correlation coefficient of -rung orthopair fuzzy sets on both bounded and unbounded continuous universes and provide some numerical examples to substantiate such arguments.

N2  - Abstract Background The lack of a value set allowing the calculation of QALY is an important limitation when establishing the value of emerging therapies to treat food allergy. The aim of this study was to develop a Short-Form Six-Dimension version 2 (SF-6Dv2) preference value set for the calculation of health utility from the Canadian food-allergic population. Methods Two hundred ninety-five parents of patients aged 0-17 years old and 154 patients aged 12 years old and above with food allergy were recruited in clinic and online. Participants were asked to complete a self-administered online questionnaire including generic health-related quality of life questionnaires. Various health states described by the SF-6Dv2 were valued with time-trade-off and discrete choice experiments. Data from elicitation techniques were combined using the hybrid regression model. Results A total of 241 parents and 125 patients performed 3904 time-trade-off and 5112 discrete choice experiments. Utility decrements were estimated for each level of each SF-6Dv2 dimension. Utility values calculated based on the validated preference set were in average 0.15 lower (95%CI: 0.12-0.18) and were poorly correlated (R2 = 0.46) with those derived from the EQ-5D-5L generic questionnaire in the same cohort. Conclusion A representative preference value set for patients with food allergy was determined using the SF-6Dv2 generic questionnaire. This adapted preference set will contribute to improve the validity of future utility estimates in this population for the appraisal of upcoming potentially impactful but sometimes costly therapies.

Specifically, this research investigates antecedents of social network usage in SMEs and respective performance outcomes. The results show that entrepreneurial orientation is positively related to social network usage in SMEs, whereas responsive market orientation shows no effect. Social network usage is not directly related to SME growth; yet it mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and SME growth. Interestingly, large firms show the opposite effects regarding antecedents and performance-related consequences of social network usage.

N2  - Abstract The increasing growth of the economy in each country necessitates a great amount of investment in infrastructure. The belief that projects involve various uncertainties, such as technical skills, management quality, and the like, indicates that most projects fail to achieve their aims, interests, costs, as well as their timeframes and space requirements. As the environment can pose significant uncertainty to any project, environmental risks should be deeply studied by project management departments. This study intends to analyze as a case the environmental risk management system within a consulting firm. From this analysis, each aspect of a project's environmental risk management is ranked using a fuzzy analytical network process (ANP), a neural network algorithm, and a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology. From the organizational aspect, budget risk is the most significant. From the technical aspect, the risk of regulations is the most important one. Finally, the risk of project failure from poor communication is another identified main risk in this research. By studying high-ranking items in this hierarchy, it can be understood that these criteria exist in different aspects; therefore, all aspects of the risk should be taken into account to cover and assess risk. A neural network algorithm for validating and reassessment of ranking is employed. Results of this application showed that, based on Spearman's rank correlation method, two different approaches resulted in similar rankings. Finally, some practical implications for responding to the most highly ranked risks are proposed.

N2  - Summary Installing new energy sources as redundant black-start (BS) units is an efficient way to enhance the speed of power system restoration, especially when there is a high risk that the available power plants considered as BS units fail to operate. In this regard, this paper provides a new optimal design for the placement of the gas turbine as the redundant energy source considering N-1 contingency analysis to improve the BS capability during restoration conditions. In doing so, there will be 2 contradictory objective functions of minimizing the maximum unavailable energy capacity and maximizing the minimum cranking path reliability. Therefore, a multiobjective problem, as a mixed integer nonlinear programming, is defined. The Pareto optimal solutions of the multiobjective problem are obtained by using a population-based meta-heuristic technique, called crow search algorithm. Two power systems are used for the validation of the proposed method. The simulation results show that the system can benefit from this method not only to increase the capability of BS generation but also to enhance the reliability of generators start-up. During the restoration process, the optimal start-up sequences of nonblack-start units and the most reliable transmission paths are also provided.

N2  - Abstract Most of the software development projects have traditionally been faced with severe problems in terms of quality, cost, and time. Researchers and practitioners have focused on agile software development methods (ASDMs) as an alternative to overcome these problems. Agile methods employ iterative development cycles, interspersed by user feedback. Agile methods were basically developed for small development teams. Scaling agile methods is a big issue from different perspectives. De-motivators play a key role in project management as it allows early identification and prompt management of threats that may arise during project execution. The objective of this paper is to identify the de-motivators while scaling agile at large, from management perspectives. We have adapted SLR and applied contrived search criteria derived from the research questions, followed by selecting the required research papers, data extraction, and data synthesis, which resulted in 15 de-motivators from 58 relevant papers. Some of the identified de-motivators are ?traditional organizational culture?, ?lack of agile experts?, ?reluctance to adopt?, and ?lack of management and commitment support?. The identified factors have been compared from various perspectives, such as continents, digital libraries, organization size, and so forth.

N2  - Abstract Rationale, aims, and objectives The application of resilience in health care requires the shift from a cause-effect approach to a systemic approach, yet few tools have been developed to measure resilience potential in this specific context. This study tests a resilience assessment grid (RAG) questionnaire to measure the resilience of anaesthesiologists, with a cross-country survey. Method A study was conducted with an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) questionnaire containing 57 detailed questions; 16 nations and 172 respondents were involved in the study. The data were statistically analysed to identify insights from the questionnaire, main improvements for further assessment, and confirmation of the design of the questionnaire. The questionnaire reliability was assessed by Cronbach analysis. Weak items were identified by a detailed correlations analysis and through a weight-polarization matrix. Construct validity was confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). Results The α level of Cronbach analysis is 0.910. PCA and FA confirmed the absence of underlying unexpected factors, with less than 8% from the first factor and a total of just 54% of variability explained by 17 factors. Suggestions for revising the questionnaire ensue from the analysis, with improvements for the questionnaire's significance. Conclusion The questionnaire shows the potential to assess proxy measures of resilience, even confirming the relevance of a structured weighting approach based on the AHP. The exemplar statistical cross-country analyses encourage the widespread use of a centralized resilience questionnaire to support standardized analyses and the diffusion of best practices among organizations.

N2  - In this paper, we describe a methodology for improving homeland security investment decisions. The objective is to evaluate multitechnology, multiyear investment choices and the associated development and deployment risks associated with new technologies. The budgeting process in the Homeland Security Department is a complex multicriteria decision problem involving a distributed network of decision makers with diverse areas of expertise. The decision problem in Homeland Security involves game-theoretic aspects as the terrorists are likely to alter their strategies depending on the defensive counter measures selected in the budget. We propose a two-phased systems approach. The first phase employs a visualization tool based on Quality Function Deployment to develop an initial budget allocation. The second phase involves an iterative approach to project selection that dynamically adjusts the investment portfolio based on anticipated reactions taken by the terrorists. This paper is based on a study done as part of a research project for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). We present a high-level view of the methodology and illustrate it with examples.

N2  - Abstract In 2009, the Sustainable Remediation Forum released a white paper entitled ?Integrating sustainable principles, practices, and metrics into remediation projects? (Ellis & Hadley, 2009, Remediation, 19, pp. 5?114). Sustainable remediation was a relatively new concept, and the white paper explored a range of approaches on how sustainability could be integrated into traditional remediation projects. This paper revisits the 2009 white paper, providing an overview of the early days of the evolving sustainable remediation practice and an assessment of the progress of sustainable remediation over the last 10 years with a primary focus on the United States. The current state of the sustainable remediation practice includes published literature, current practices and resources, applications, room for improvement, international progress, the virtuous cycle that applying sustainable remediation creates, and the status of the objectives cited in the 2009 white paper. Over the last decade, several sustainable remediation frontiers have emerged that will likely be a focus in advancing the practice. These frontiers include climate change and resiliency, weighting and valuation to help better consolidate different sustainable remediation metrics, programmatic implementation, and better integration of the societal impacts of sustainable remediation. Finally, as was the case for the 2009 white paper, this paper explores how sustainable remediation may evolve over the next 10 years and focuses on the events and drivers that can be significant in the pace of further development of the practice. The events and drivers include transformation impacts, societal influences, and the continued development of new technologies, approaches, and tools by remediation practitioners. The remediation industry has made significant progress in developing the practice of sustainable remediation and has implemented it successfully into hundreds of projects. While progress has been significant, an opportunity exists to implement the tenets of sustainable remediation on many more projects and explore new frontiers to help improve the communication, integration, and derived benefits from implementing sustainable remediation into future remediation projects.

N2  - Abstract Ecosystem services and economic returns from semi-arid rangelands are threatened by land degradation. Policies to improve ecosystem service delivery often fail to consider uncertainty in economic returns gained through different land uses and management practices. We apply an analytical framework using stochastic simulation to estimate the range of potential monetary outcomes of rangeland ecosystem services under different land uses, including consideration of the uncertainty and variability of model parameters. We assess monetary and non-monetary dimensions, including those ecosystem services with uncertain and missing information, for communal rangelands, commercial ranches, game farms and Wildlife Management Areas in southern Kgalagadi District, Botswana. Public land uses (communal grazing areas and protected conservation land in Wildlife Management Areas) provide higher economic value than private land uses (commercial ranches and game farms), despite private land uses being more profitable in their returns from meat production. Communal rangelands and protected areas are important for a broader range of ecosystem services (cultural/spiritual services, recreation, firewood, construction material and wild food), which play a key role in sustaining the livelihoods of the largest share of society. The full range of ecosystem services should therefore be considered in economic assessments, while policies targeting sustainable land management should value and support their provision and utilisation. By forecasting the range of plausible ecosystem values of different rangeland land uses in monetary terms, our analysis provides policymakers with a tool to assess outcomes of land use and management decisions and policies.

N2  - Abstract In an increasingly competitive market, small and medium enterprises have the temporarily option to divide their core competencies in sub-competences. In fact, this is the purpose of so-called virtual organizations (VOs), which aim to attend a particular goal joining partner forces. However, when these VOs are created, it is necessary to deal with the maximum number of participants involved in the process and the risk involved in these relationships, which should be measured through a well-defined process. This paper aims to present an approach to dimensioning the maximum number of participants involved in the formation of a VO composed of several service providers. This approach is based on the overall risk level of the participants and uses different risk analysis methods to assess the suitable number of participants to be part of a VO.

N2  - Summary The paper describes a comprehensive approach to problems of performance measurement that can be used to tackle a wide range of situations, including designing monthly board and leadership reports in enterprises, assessing research quality and monitoring the efficiency and effectiveness of government programmes. It provides a review of various methods for tackling these problems and outlines some current areas of research. Although technical statistical issues are buried somewhat below the surface, statistical thinking is very much part of the main line of argument, meaning that performance measurement should be an area attracting serious attention from statisticians.

N2  - The primary aim of this paper is to present a fuzzy probabilistic approach for optimal design and rehabilitation of water distribution systems, combining aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in a unified framework. The randomness and imprecision in future water consumption are characterized using fuzzy random variables whose realizations are not real but fuzzy numbers, and the nodal head requirements are represented by fuzzy sets, reflecting the imprecision in customers' requirements. The optimal design problem is formulated as a two-objective optimization problem, with minimization of total design cost and maximization of system performance as objectives. The system performance is measured by the fuzzy random reliability, defined as the probability that the fuzzy head requirements are satisfied across all network nodes. The satisfactory degree is represented by necessity measure or belief measure in the sense of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. An efficient algorithm is proposed, within a Monte Carlo procedure, to calculate the fuzzy random system reliability and is effectively combined with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) to derive the Pareto optimal design solutions. The newly proposed methodology is demonstrated with two case studies: the New York tunnels network and Hanoi network. The results from both cases indicate that the new methodology can effectively accommodate and handle various aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty sources arising from the design process and can provide optimal design solutions that are not only cost-effective but also have higher reliability to cope with severe future uncertainties.

N2  - Abstract This article proposes a new method of project performance evaluation, by which project performance data can be better understood. This article combines principal component analysis (PCA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) to enhance the efficiency of decision-making units more accurately. The data used was based on energy projects promoted by the Bureau of Energy at the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taiwan. The results of this article show that by combining PCA and DEA in evaluating the performance of energy projects, there was an improved evaluation of projects over simply using DEA data alone.

N2  - Abstract Corporate social responsibility (CSR) can be measured by a number of different criteria, some of which are similar to each other, while others can be manifestly contrary to the general tendency. This means that some companies can obtain a good valuation in some criteria but a bad valuation in others, which makes it difficult to assess the company's overall CSR valuation. It is not easy to find a single measure that covers all aspects of corporate social performance. This paper aims to estimate multicriteria CSR performance through different models of goal programming and by taking into account all the dimensions that make up CSR. An illustrative example shows the result of applying these models to a database composed of 212 European companies, which enabled us to identify the most socially responsible group, regardless of the approach considered in the construction of the multicriteria performance. The results show that environmental and corporate governance dimensions are the most important elements in measuring this performance.

N2  - Abstract The interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (IVq-ROFS) and complex fuzzy set (CFS) are two generalizations of the fuzzy set (FS) to cope with uncertain information in real decision making problems. The aim of the present work is to develop the concept of complex interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (CIVq-ROFS) as a generalization of interval-valued complex fuzzy set (IVCFS) and q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS), which can better express the time-periodic problems and two-dimensional information in a single set. In this article not only basic properties of CIVq-ROFSs are discussed but also averaging aggregation operator (AAO) and geometric aggregation operator (GAO) with some desirable properties and operations on CIVq-ROFSs are discussed. The proposed operations are the extension of the operations of IVq-ROFS, q-ROFS, interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy, Pythagorean fuzzy (PF), interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy, intuitionistic fuzzy, complex q-ROFS, complex PF, and complex intuitionistic fuzzy theories. Further, the Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method are also examine based on CIVq-ROFS to explore the reliability and proficiency of the work. Moreover, we discussed the advantages of CIVq-ROFS and showed that the concepts of IVCFS and q-ROFS are the special cases of CIVq-ROFS. Moreover, the flexibility of proposed averaging aggregation operator and geometric aggregation operator in a multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problem are also discussed. Finally, a comparative study of CIVq-ROFSs with pre-existing work is discussed in detail.

N2  - Abstract Decision making in food safety is a complex process that involves several criteria of different nature like the expected reduction in the number of illnesses, the potential economic or health-related cost, or even the environmental impact of a given policy or intervention. Several multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) algorithms are currently used, mostly individually, in food safety to rank different options in a multifactorial environment. However, the selection of the MCDA algorithm is a decision problem on its own because different methods calculate different rankings. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of different uncertainty sources on the rankings of MCDA problems in the context of food safety. For that purpose, a previously published data set on emerging zoonoses in the Netherlands was used to compare different MCDA algorithms: MMOORA, TOPSIS, VIKOR, WASPAS, and ELECTRE III. The rankings were calculated with and without considering uncertainty (using fuzzy sets), to assess the importance of this factor. The rankings obtained differed between algorithms, emphasizing that the selection of the MCDA method had a relevant impact in the rankings. Furthermore, considering uncertainty in the ranking had a high influence on the results. Both factors were more relevant than the weights associated with each criterion in this case study. A hierarchical clustering method was suggested to aggregate results obtained by the different algorithms. This complementary step seems to be a promising way to decrease extreme difference among algorithms and could provide a strong added value in the decision-making process.

N2  - Abstract Lack of sufficient knowledge of the project environment can increase investment risks. Accordingly, the identification, grading, and management of risks are essential to project success. Risk identification is an accurate, detailed, and probing process that identifies risks during project life cycle by interacting with individuals and experts. Because risks constantly recur and change during project life cycle, risk identification is an essential and iterative process in all project phases. So, this study aims to identify and prioritise construction projects risks using a hybrid quantitative approach, namely, Fuzzy Decision Making and Trial Evaluation Laboratory (FDEMATEL) and Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) techniques. After review of the relevant literature and classification of the identified investment risks into three main risks, the above-mentioned techniques were applied. Results revealed that systemic risk is the most influential factor whereas environmental risk is the most permeable factor among the main criteria. The highest weight belongs to the business risk factor whereas the lowest weight belongs to systemic risk. These were the most and least important factors of the risks involved in construction projects from the perspective of the experts.

N2  - Abstract This study contributes a decision analytic framework to overcome policy inertia and myopia in complex river basin management contexts. The framework combines reservoir policy identification, many-objective optimization under uncertainty, and visual analytics to characterize current operations and discover key trade-offs between alternative policies for balancing competing demands and system uncertainties. The approach is demonstrated on the Conowingo Dam, located within the Lower Susquehanna River, USA. The Lower Susquehanna River is an interstate water body that has been subject to intensive water management efforts due to competing demands from urban water supply, atomic power plant cooling, hydropower production, and federally regulated environmental flows. We have identified a baseline operating policy for the Conowingo Dam that closely reproduces the dynamics of current releases and flows for the Lower Susquehanna and thus can be used to represent the preferences structure guiding current operations. Starting from this baseline policy, our proposed decision analytic framework then combines evolutionary many-objective optimization with visual analytics to discover new operating policies that better balance the trade-offs within the Lower Susquehanna. Our results confirm that the baseline operating policy, which only considers deterministic historical inflows, significantly overestimates the system's reliability in meeting the reservoir's competing demands. Our proposed framework removes this bias by successfully identifying alternative reservoir policies that are more robust to hydroclimatic uncertainties while also better addressing the trade-offs across the Conowingo Dam's multisector services.

N2  - Summary Rice is an important cereal crop, being a staple food for over half of the world's population, and sexual reproduction resulting in grain formation underpins global food security. However, despite considerable research efforts, many of the genes, especially long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) genes, involved in sexual reproduction in rice remain uncharacterized. With an increasing number of public resources becoming available, information from different sources can be combined to perform gene functional annotation. We report the development of MCRiceRepGP, a machine learning framework which integrates heterogeneous evidence and employs multicriteria decision analysis and machine learning to predict coding and lincRNA genes involved in sexual reproduction in rice. The rice genome was reannotated using deep-sequencing transcriptomic data from reproduction-associated tissue/cell types identifying previously unannotated putative protein-coding genes and lincRNAs. MCRiceRepGP was used for genome-wide discovery of sexual reproduction associated coding and lincRNA genes. The protein-coding and lincRNA genes identified have distinct expression profiles, with a large proportion of lincRNAs reaching maximum expression levels in the sperm cells. Some of the genes are potentially linked to male- and female-specific fertility and heat stress tolerance during the reproductive stage. MCRiceRepGP can be used in combination with other genome-wide studies, such as genome-wide association studies, giving greater confidence that the genes identified are associated with the biological process of interest. As more data, especially about mutant plant phenotypes, become available, the power of MCRiceRepGP will grow, providing researchers with a tool to identify candidate genes for future experiments. MCRiceRepGP is available as a web application (http://mcgplannotator.com/MCRiceRepGP/).

N2  - The study of experimental design in conjunction with artificial neural networks for optimization of isocratic ultra performance liquid chromatography method for separation of mycophenolate mofetil and its degradation products has been reported. Experimental design showed to be suitable for selection of experimental scheme, while Kennard-Stone algorithm was used for selection of training data set. The input variables were column temperature and composition of mobile phase including percentage of acetonitrile, concentration of ammonium acetate in buffer, and its pH value. The retention factor of the most retentive component and selectivity factors were used as the dependent variables (outputs). In this way, artificial neural network has been applied as a predictable tool in solving a method optimization problem using small number of experiments. Network architecture and training parameters were optimized to the lowest root-mean-square error values, and the network with 5-4-4-4 topology has been selected as the most predictable one. Predicted data were in good agreement with experimental data, and regression statistics confirmed good ability of trained network to predict compounds retention. The optimal chromatographic conditions included column temperature of 40°C, flow rate of 700?µl?min?1, 26% of acetonitrile and 9?mM ammonium acetate in mobile phase, and buffer pH of 5.87. The chromatographic analysis has been achieved within 5.2?min. The validation of the proposed method was also performed considering selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection, and limit of quantification, and the results indicated that the method fulfilled all required criteria. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of commercial dosage form. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract To determine the weights of the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator, a new approach that is termed as rank-based analysis method with subjective information is developed. Available information called importance ratio that is obtained by subjective judgment of expert(s) is used in the OWA weights determination. The proposed approach is further extended to the situation of group decision making and is also used to obtain the weights of experts in this situation. In this case, the final OWA weights are obtained through a complete consistent group judgment matrix. Finally, a numerical example regarding the selection of the optimal R&D personnel is given to illustrate the application of the new method in group decision making.

N2  - Abstract A Raman-based, strain-independent, semi-automated method is presented that allows the rapid (<3 hours) determination of antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from clinical samples. Applying a priori knowledge about the mode of action of the respective antibiotic, we identified characteristic Raman marker bands in the spectrum and calculated batch-wise weighted sum scores from standardized Raman intensity differences between spectra of antibiotic exposed and nonexposed samples of the same strains. The lead substances for three relevant antibiotic classes (fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin, third-generation cephalosporin cefotaxime, ureidopenicillin piperacillin) against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MRGN) revealed a high sensitivity and specificity for the susceptibility testing of two Escherichia coli laboratory strains and 12 clinical isolates. The method benefits from the parallel incubation of control and treated samples, which reduces the variance due to alterations in cultivation conditions and the standardization of differences between batches leading to long-term comparability of Raman measurements.

N2  - The purpose of this paper is to present an index that assesses the contribution of the intellectual capital (IC) to the value creation process of an organization. The index combines into a single measure the contributions of the individual IC elements on the basis of their strategic importance, their performance, and their reciprocal influence. Five steps, based on the Assessment and Management of Intellectual Capital (AMIC), are considered as essential to build up the index. First, a theoretical framework is developed to underpin the process of selection of the different IC categories. Then, further steps suggest how to aggregate, weigh, and normalize the value of the IC categories in order to build the AMIC index. The index has been implemented into the ?Software? community of innovation of Finmeccanica, which is the leading Italian group in Aerospace, Defence, and Security. We argue that the AMIC index can be successfully used to assess and verify the performance of the value creation process and to explain the behaviour of each specific IC category and its contribution to the combined unit value. Furthermore, the analysis of each category contribution to the value creation can be carried out both in terms of stock and flow in order to highlight the quantitative and qualitative interrelations among the categories.

N2  - Physical infrastructure systems are commonly composed of interconnected and interdependent subsystems, which in their essence constitute system of systems (S-o-S). System owners and policy researchers need tools to foresee potential emergent forced changes and to understand their impact so that effective risk management strategies can be developed. We develop a systemic framework for precursor analysis to support the design of an effective and efficient precursor monitoring and decision support system with the ability to (i) identify and prioritize indicators of evolving risks of system failure; and (ii) evaluate uncertainties in precursor analysis to support informed and rational decision making. This integrated precursor analysis framework is comprised of three processes: precursor identification, prioritization, and evaluation. We use an example of a highway bridge S-o-S to demonstrate the theories and methodologies of the framework. Bridge maintenance processes involve many interconnected and interdependent functional subsystems and decision-making entities and bridge failure can have broad social and economic consequences. The precursor analysis framework, which constitutes an essential part of risk analysis, examines the impact of various bridge inspection and maintenance scenarios. It enables policy researchers and analysts who are seeking a risk perspective on bridge infrastructure in a policy setting to develop more risk informed policies and create guidelines to efficiently allocate limited risk management resources and mitigate severe consequences resulting from bridge failures.

N2  - Web mining is the process of extracting useful information from Web resources. Handling outliers is one of the primary challenges of present Web mining techniques. The complex nature of the Web, by virtue of both data and users, makes it very difficult to mine the information and convert to knowledge base with little outlier values. In this paper, a framework for reducing outliers in regression analysis with the help of ordered weighted operators (OWA) as a multicriteria decision-making problem is being formulated. First, a regression problem with a real-time Web data set will be formulated followed by solving the same with the help of a variant of OWA operators. Results, thus obtained are able to prove that outliers can be reduced significantly with the help of proposed approach.

N2  - The study aims to rank the performance of Indian private sector banks on the basis of their financial capability. The study is focussed on those banks which are listed in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), for the period from 2014?15 to 2018?19. The financial performance of selected Indian private banks is ranked using a hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique, that is, AHP-TOPSIS. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to determine the weights of 10 financial performance pointers, and further Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used to provide rankings and benchmarking of the private sector banks. Thereafter, overall ranking is given to the selected banks using interval-valued TOPSIS (IV-TOPSIS) for a combined period of 5?years. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to check the robustness of the method and its impact on the final ranking of the banks. Results showed that HDFC bank is the top performer and is ranked first for all the years consecutively during the period 2014?2019 and has set a financial indicator benchmark for other competitor banks. South Indian Bank showed the worst results in each year and stood last in the overall ranking. The IndusInd bank is followed after HDFC bank by improving its performance from 2014?19. With a slight margin, Kotak Mahindra Bank ranked after IndusInd. Through the AHP-TOPSIS technique, each year the private sector banks ranking differs among themselves depending upon the financial performance pointers. Based on interval-valued TOPSIS (IV-TOPSIS), it was found that the overall HDFC was the top-performing bank and South Indian Bank was the worst-performing bank among all other banks. The results obtained from sensitivity analysis were found to be consistent with IV-TOPSIS. The paper used the AHP technique, which is subjective in nature, and the results depend on the opinion of the experts. This study will assist the investors who want to channelize their funds in private banks having shares enlisted in BSE. It will accommodate banks to compare and judge their financial performance along with improving their performance and planning their future strategy. AHP-TOPSIS utilized by past researchers is unable to bring out the cumulative performance for banks, but in this paper, IV-TOPSIS is utilized, which can be effectively used to evaluate the cumulative performance of banks. The study tries to fill the gap in the literature by providing the overall ranking to private sector banks in India on the basis of financial indicators.

N2  - In this study, we review POM-based research related to prevention of terrorism. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) terrorist attacks have the potential to be prevented. Consequently, the focus of this study is on security enhancement and improving the resiliency of a nation to prevent terrorist attacks. Accordingly, we review articles from the 25 top journals, [following procedures developed by Gupta et al. (2016)], in the fields of Production and Operations Management, Operations Research, Management Science, and Supply Chain Management. In addition, we searched some selected journals in the fields of Information Sciences, Political Science, and Economics. This literature is organized and reviewed under the following seven core capabilities defined by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS): (1) Intelligence and Information Sharing, (2) Planning, (3) Interdiction and Disruption, (4) Screening, Search, and Detection, (5) Forensics and Attribution, (6) Public Information and Warning, and (7) Operational Coordination. We found that POM research on terrorism is primarily driven by the type of information that a defending country and a terrorist have about each other. Game theory is the main technique that is used in most research papers. Possible directions for future research are discussed.

N2  - Abstract This study identifies and addresses an important gap in the nascent literature on big data analytics, using a longitudinal case study to investigate the implementation and application of big data analytics into a small firm specialized in transport logistics. Our research is rooted in Practice Theory, considering the implementation of new technologies in organizations as a result of multiple social negotiations, interpretations, and interactions. Our findings indicate the importance and centrality of human factors in decision-making and operational implementation, technology representing only a means to a clearly specified and collectively assumed objective. Big data analytics adoption and use in the case-study firm represents a gradual process, with each stage justified by the need to solve the problems caused by heavy and unpredictable road traffic. This approach validates the entrepreneurial effectuation model, which defines a firm's strategy as a fragmented but continuous effort to find and implement effective solutions to the market challenges encountered.

N2  - Summary There is an increasing worldwide concern about the problem of dealing with the waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), given the high volume of appliances that are disposed of every day. In this article, an environmental evaluation of WEEE is performed that combines life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology and multivariate statistical techniques. Because LCA handles a large number of data in its different phases, when one is trying to uncover the structure of large multidimensional data sets, multivariate statistical techniques can provide useful information. In particular, principal-component analysis and multidimensional scaling are two important dimension-reducing tools that have been shown to be of help in understanding this type of complex multivariate data set. In this article, we use a variable selection method that reduces the number of categories for which the environmental impacts have to be computed; this step is especially useful when the number of impact categories or the number of products or processes to benchmark increases. We provide a detailed illustration showing how we have used the proposed approach to analyze and interpret the environmental impacts of different domestic appliances.

N2  - The objective of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the clinical benefits and harms of prasugrel, clopidogrel, and a CYP2C19 genotype-guided drug selection strategy for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and planned percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We used decision-analytic techniques to model the risks and benefits of alternative antiplatelet strategies. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the results. Prasugrel demonstrated little difference in net benefit as compared with clopidogrel (+0.02 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs); 95% confidence range (CR), ?0.23 to 0.21). The genotype-guided strategy had a 93% probability of greater net benefit as compared with clopidogrel (+0.05 QALYs; 95% CR, ?0.02 to 0.11), and 66% probability of greater net benefit as compared with prasugrel (+0.03 QALYs; 95% CR, ?0.13 to 0.24). Prasugrel and clopidogrel differ in their risk?benefit profiles but appear to offer similar net benefit on average. Use of patient-specific factors such as CYP2C19 genotype offers promise for developing a personalized medicine approach to antiplatelet treatment regimens.

N2  - Abstract We have developed an expert system comprising a self-aware framework for resource-efficient and accurate data transmission within a low-power lossy sensor network (LLN) deployed for indoor monitoring. We derived both individual and group awareness, which could ensure the awareness of each sensor regarding its resources, neighbours and network environment. The proposed expert system facilitates decision-making under dynamic environmental conditions and employs a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model to determine the selection of the best path towards the sink node with awareness of the existing network environment. The proposed system is validated by constructing a 6LoWPAN network in the Contiki Cooja simulator. MCDM is applied to generate an adaptive objective function for the IPv6 routing protocol for the LLN (RPL) and to aid in ranking the nodes to select the best available neighbouring node, while the data accuracy is ensured by the cluster head through data correlation among its associated members. The network performance is assessed by analyzing the packet delivery rate, throughput and energy consumption against varying sensors and by comparing our proposed MCDM-RPL with a standard RPL and a fuzzy-based RPL, where the results show that our framework is found to be better with gains of 13, 25 and 13%, respectively.

N2  - AbstractAutomated decision systems have shown the potential to increase data yields from field experiments in atmospheric science. The present paper describes the construction and performance of a flight decision system designed for a case in which investigators pursued multiple, potentially competing objectives. The Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) campaign in 2012 sought in situ airborne measurements of isolated deep convection in three study regions: northeast Colorado, north Alabama, and a larger region extending from central Oklahoma through northwest Texas. As they confronted daily flight launch decisions, campaign investigators sought to achieve two mission objectives that stood in potential tension to each other: to maximize the total amount of data collected while also collecting approximately equal amounts of data from each of the three study regions. Creating an automated decision system involved understanding how investigators would themselves negotiate the trade-offs between these potentially competing goals, and representing those preferences formally using a utility function that served to rank-order the perceived value of alternative data portfolios. The decision system incorporated a custom-built method for generating probabilistic forecasts of isolated deep convection and estimated climatologies calibrated to historical observations. Monte Carlo simulations of alternative future conditions were used to generate flight decision recommendations dynamically consistent with the expected future progress of the campaign. Results show that a strict adherence to the recommendations generated by the automated system would have boosted the data yield of the campaign by between 10 and 57%, depending on the metrics used to score success, while improving portfolio balance.

N2  - Abstract Mathematical formulations of reliability-based design and robust design have been developed for addressing the presence of uncertainty during optimization. When reliability is introduced in the design process, the constraints that are influenced by uncertainty are converted into probabilistic constraints. This ensures that the optimal solution will satisfy the constraints in the presence of uncertainty within a prescribed reliability level. Robustness is introduced by modifying the objective function to depend on the mean and variance of the response of the objective function. This paper presents a formulation for applying reliability-based design and robust design within a network of parallel optimizations in order to account for uncertainty in multidiscipline design optimization. The method for multidiscipline design optimization under uncertainty is applied to a conceptual ship design. The model of a bulk carrier from the literature is used in this analysis. The optimization results are compared with previous data and they demonstrate that reliable and robust optimization can be applied effectively to ship design, and that it is important to consider uncertainty during the multidiscipline ship design process.

N2  - Sustainable remediation guidance, frameworks, and case studies have been published at an international level illustrating established sustainability assessment methodologies and successful implementation. Though the terminology and indicators evaluated may differ, one common theme among international organizations and regulatory bodies is more comprehensive and transparent methods are needed to evaluate the social sphere of sustainable remediation. Based on a literature review and stakeholder input, this paper focused on three main areas: (1) status quo of how the social element of sustainable remediation is assessed among various countries and organizations; (2) methodologies to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate societal impacts; and (3) findings from this research, including challenges, obstacles, and a path forward. In conclusion, several existing social impact assessment techniques are readily available for use by the remediation community, including rating and scoring system evaluations, enhanced cost benefit analysis, surveys/interviews, social network analysis, and multicriteria decision analysis. In addition, a list of 10 main social indicator categories were developed: health and safety, economic stimulation, stakeholder collaboration, benefits community at large, alleviate undesirable community impacts, equality issues, value of ecosystem services and natural resources, risk-based land management and remedial solutions, regional and global societal impacts, and contributions to other policies. Evaluation of the social element of remedial activities is not without challenges and knowledge gaps. Identification of obstacles and gaps during the project planning process is essential to defining sustainability objectives and choosing the appropriate tool and methodology to conduct an assessment. Challenges identified include meaningful stakeholder engagement, risk perception of stakeholders, and trade-offs among the various triple bottom line dimensions. ?2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - ABSTRACT Given the veterinary and public health impact of vector-borne diseases, there is a clear need to assess the suitability of landscapes for the emergence and spread of these diseases. Current approaches for predicting disease risks neglect key features of the landscape as components of the functional habitat of vectors or hosts, and hence of the pathogen. Empirical?statistical methods do not explicitly incorporate biological mechanisms, whereas current mechanistic models are rarely spatially explicit; both methods ignore the way animals use the landscape (i.e. movement ecology). We argue that applying a functional concept for habitat, i.e. the resource-based habitat concept (RBHC), can solve these issues. The RBHC offers a framework to identify systematically the different ecological resources that are necessary for the completion of the transmission cycle and to relate these resources to (combinations of) landscape features and other environmental factors. The potential of the RBHC as a framework for identifying suitable habitats for vector-borne pathogens is explored and illustrated with the case of bluetongue virus, a midge-transmitted virus affecting ruminants. The concept facilitates the study of functional habitats of the interacting species (vectors as well as hosts) and provides new insight into spatial and temporal variation in transmission opportunities and exposure that ultimately determine disease risks. It may help to identify knowledge gaps and control options arising from changes in the spatial configuration of key resources across the landscape. The RBHC framework may act as a bridge between existing mechanistic and statistical modelling approaches.

N2  - Abstract Ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator has been received increasingly widespread interest since its appearance in 1988.

N2  - Summary Now, with the development of modern business, the traditional competition between enterprises has been displaced by the competition between supply chains. Any incorrect decision from supply chain member may have negative influences on other members or the whole supply chain. Therefore, choosing the appropriate supply chain partners is quite necessary and significant to the supply chain performance improvement because the partners can share risks and benefits with proper contract. Concentrating on the agricultural products supply chain, the supply chain partner selection model and indexes system are put forward in this paper, the clustering and classification analyses of potential supply chain partners are made by data mining technology, and the empirical analysis is made for agricultural products supply chain. This study may provide some insights into supply chain longitudinal governance and guidance for the Chinese agriculture economic development. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Multiple response simultaneous optimization employing Derringer's desirability function was used for the development of a capillary electrophoresis method for the simultaneous determination of rosiglitazone (RSG) and glimepiride (GLM) in plasma and formulations. Twenty experiments, taking the two resolutions, the analysis time, and the capillary current as the responses with three important factors?buffer morality, volte and column temperature?were used to design mathematical models. The experimental responses were fitted into a second order polynomial and the six responses were simultaneously optimized to predict the optimum conditions for the effective separation of the studied compounds. The separation was carried out by using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) with a silica capillary column and diode array detector at 210 nm. The optimum assay conditions were 52 mmol l?1 phosphate buffer, pH 7, and voltage of 22 kV at 29 °C. The method showed good agreement between the experimental data and predictive value throughout the studied parameter space. The assay limit of detection was 0.02 µgml?1 and the effective working range at relative standard deviation (RSD) of ≤ 5% was 0.05?16 µgml?1 (r = 0.999) for both drugs. Analytical recoveries of the studied drugs from spiked plasma were 97.2?101.9 ± 0.31?3.0%. The precision of the assay was satisfactory; RSD was 1.07 and 1.14 for intra- and inter-assay precision, respectively. The proposed method has a great value in routine analysis of RSG and GLM for its therapeutic monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract This study explores the application of a civic perception analysis in the context of stream restoration as a social-ecological system (SES). Analysing such a SES is useful for understanding correlations between civic interests and environmental conditions in river restoration. An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis was used to quantify the demand for restoration objectives. Additionally, an image-based survey was used to precisely capture residents' perceptions of urban stream restoration by comparing aesthetic images, hydrologic functions, and environmental quality. Based on the AHP results, a hierarchical multiple regression was derived. A total of 181 participants responded to our survey, and the results were summarized by each subwatershed in the An'Yang watershed. The results demonstrated that the perceptions of residents who live in various environmental and regional conditions may manifoldly reflect their personal visual and aesthetic preferences by subwatershed. The upstream subwatershed values (SW1 = 7.86 and SW2 = 7.39) were higher than those in the downstream areas (SW5 = 5.28 and SW6 = 5.15). Consequently, this hierarchical multilevel model showed that individual environmental perception was highly associated with visual preference regarding stream restoration at the subwatershed level (p < 0.001). Urban environmental and spatial planners could use such information when restoring and designing waterfront spaces.

N2  - The big data revolution is making vast amounts of information available in all sectors of the economy including health care. One important type of data that is particularly relevant to medicine is observational data from actual practice. In comparison to experimental data from clinical studies, observational data offers much larger sample sizes and much broader coverage of patient variables. Properly combining observational data with experimental data can facilitate precision medicine by enabling detection of heterogeneity in patient responses to treatments and tailoring of health care to the specific needs of individuals. However, because it is high-dimensional and uncontrolled, observational data presents unique methodological challenges. The modeling and analysis tools of the production and operations management field are well-suited to these challenges and hence POM scholars are critical to the realization of precision medicine with its many benefits to society.

N2  - In power distribution systems, with their great vastness and various outage causes, one of the most important problems of power distribution companies is to select a suitable maintenance strategy of system elements and method of financial planning for the maintenance of system elements with the two objectives of decrease in outage costs and improvement of system reliability. In this article, a practical method is introduced for the selection of a suitable system elements maintenance strategy; moreover, to plan the preventive maintenance budget for the system elements, two methods are offered: the cost optimization method and the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. In the former method, a new model of system maintenance cost is offered. This model, based on system outage information, the elements maintenance costs are determined as functions of system reliability indices and preventive maintenance budget. The latter method, too, a new guideline is introduced for considering the cost and reliability criteria in the trend of preventive maintenance budget planning. In this method, the preventive maintenance budget for the elements is determined based on relative priority of elements with reliability criteria. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Abstract Nowadays, we can use different websites that help us make decisions about various aspects of our lives. However, privacy protection prevents websites from providing personalised guidelines to users. We propose a novel doctor-ranking system (DRS) based on multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) method to address the problems of privacy protection. The following aspects differentiate our proposed DRS model from previous works: (a) textual information reviews are used to identify user preferences and complementary criteria, (b) criteria weights are determined by term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) instead of Delphi method or expert opinion, (c) intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) are used to replace sentiment analysis to express subjective user criteria, and (d) VIsekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranjie (VIKOR) method for MCGDM with IFSs is used to solve the doctor-ranking problem. We apply our proposed model to datasets from Haodf.com to compare the performance of our method with that of sentiment analysis and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods. The experimental results show that our method provides accurate ranking and increases the reliability of DRS.

N2  - Abstract Eutrophication and sporadic algal blooms occurring in the tributary bays of the Three Gorges Reservoir in Hubei, China, have become major environmental issues following impoundment. However, predicting eutrophication with traditional methods based on monthly monitoring data remains challenging. In order to explore the potential of data-driven models in eutrophication prediction and establish reliable prediction data-driven model based on monthly monitoring data. In this study, two ensemble-learning models, random forests (RF) and gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT), were used to predict eutrophication in Zhuyi Bay. To address the target, three objectives were solved. First, RF and GBDT used to regress chlorophyll-a concentrations showed good model fit across two monitoring data sets, with R2 values of 0.809 and 0.822 for RF and 0.824 and 0.828 for GBDT. Second, the relative variable importance plots computed by ensemble-learning models was calculated for selecting monitoring parameters and identify drivers of eutrophication. To improve model fit, it was more important to monitor key parameters of eutrophication (such as water transparency) than to increase sample size. Third, K-Means++ modelling was used to partition eutrophication data into discrete levels. For three eutrophication levels, the classification accuracies of RF and GBDT were 0.8936 and 0.9064, respectively. When using only two eutrophication levels, accuracies for both models increased to 0.9617. This study suggests that ensemble-learning models, and in particular GBDT (firstly used in eutrophication), show excellent fitting ability for eutrophication compared with other machine-learning models and provided reliable eutrophication prediction method based on monthly monitoring data.

N2  - Abstract Two methods based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) and PageRank are proposed to rank college athletic coaches. The DEA-based method uses four processes: first, the input factors must undergo the Kendall Consistency Check to ensure the feasibility and consistency of the result; second, the Data Reduction Factor epitomizes the input?output factors; third, the Range Transfer Approach standardizes the parameters and fourth, Efficiency Assessment Values for each coach are computed using a DEA model. The PageRank-based method involves building a network for matching coaches whose algorithms are used for the ranking. Sensitivity analysis and general analysing methods are applied to examine and analyse the ranking results for baseball, basketball and football coaches. The PageRank-based method also considers dynamic and diffusion relationships among coaches. The results are analysed to reveal possible features to improve the method.

N2  - A single-valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) is an instance of a neutrosophic set, which can be used to handle uncertainty, imprecise, indeterminate, and inconsistent information in real life. In this paper, a new distance measure between two SVNSs is defined by the full consideration of truth-membership function, indeterminacy-membership function, and falsity-membership function for the forward and backward differences. Then the similarity measure, the entropy measure, and the index of distance are also presented. Finally, two illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed clustering method and multicriteria decision-making method based on the distance (similarity) measure between SVNSs.

N2  - Abstract Objectives In the context of the gradual development of artificial intelligence in health care, the clinical decision support systems (CDSS) play an increasing crucial role in improving the quality of the therapeutic and diagnostic efficiency in health care. The fuzzy logic (FL) provides an effective means for dealing with uncertainties in the health decision-making process; therefore, FL-based CDSS becomes a very powerful tool for data and knowledge management, being able to think like an expert clinician. This work proposes an FL-based CDSS for the evaluation of renal function in posttransplant patients. Method Based on the data provided by the Department of Nephrology of the University Hospital Federico II of Naples, a statistical sample is selected according to appropriate inclusion criteria. Four fuzzy inference systems are implemented monitoring the renal function by the level of proteinuria and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Results The systems show an accuracy of more than 90% and the outputs are provided through easy to read graphics, so that physicians can intuitively monitor the patient's clinical status, with the objective to improve drugs dosage and reduce medication errors. Conclusions We propose that the CDSSs for the assessment and follow-up of kidney-transplanted patients built in this study are applicable to clinical practice.

N2  - Abstract The concept of technological ecosystems has been increasingly applied across different domains but rarely in the area of capability development. This paper contributes to addressing this knowledge gap by demonstrating the potential value of applying the technological ecosystems perspective to support technology investment decisions. We present a practical step-by-step approach to show how this approach can be used in practice and illustrate it using two case studies in the military domain. Case A looks at emerging technologies in health support; and Case B is concerned with driverless vehicles in dangerous environments. In both instances, the concepts are developed via facilitated workshops and the technological ecosystem maps are derived by analyzing the enabling technological elements and the relationships between them. Subsequent analysis shows how the technological ecosystem framing assists in gaining a holistic picture of the potential impacts of technology adoption and how it can be used to reframe capability options in terms of technology groupings. Technological ecosystem analysis across the two cases is used to identify common capability enablers and multidomain capability enhancing elements. We discuss the types of components within the generated technological ecosystem maps and point to directions for future work enabled by technological ecosystem mapping in capability development.

Decision-making is used to motivate students towards applying, understanding, and appreciating linear algebra in a diversity of projects. this experience introduces students to the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a multi-attribute, decision-making technique that is rooted in linear algebra. Through a simulation scenario, each team of students develops a project about any real-world problem consisting of a decision-making process in the presence of multiple intangibles. At the same time, the algebraic fundamentals that make the process valid and consistent are clarified. The students showed great interest in the experience; and the results obtained confirmed that the activities helped them understand several complex concepts related to linear algebra, and fostered a significant interest in a subject traditionally considered frighteningly abstract. Finally, the students appreciated the stimulating insights provided by linear algebra that are crucial in decision-making. This multi-disciplinary experience enables the evaluation of several cross skills and competencies such as critical thinking and ethical leadership. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - SummaryIn the design process of computer systems or processor architectures, typically many different parameters are exposed to configure, tune, and optimize every component of a system. For evaluations and before production, it is desirable to know the best setting for all parameters. Processing speed is no longer the only objective that needs to be optimized; power consumption, area, and so on have become very important. Thus, the best configurations have to be found in respect to multiple objectives. In this article, we use a multi-objective design space exploration tool called Framework for Automatic Design Space Exploration (FADSE) to automatically find near-optimal configurations in the vast design space of a processor architecture together with a tool for code optimizations and hence evaluate both automatically. As example, we use the Grid ALU Processor (GAP) and its postlink optimizer called GAPtimize, which can apply feedback-directed and platform-specific code optimizations. Our results show that FADSE is able to cope with both design spaces. Less than 25% of the maximal reasonable hardware effort for the scalable elements of the GAP is enough to achieve the processor's performance maximum. With a performance reduction tolerance of 10%, the necessary hardware complexity can be further reduced by about two-thirds. The found high-quality configurations are analyzed, exhibiting strong relationships between the parameters of the GAP, the distribution of complexity, and the total performance. These performance numbers can be improved by applying code optimizations concurrently to optimizing the hardware parameters. FADSE can find near-optimal configurations by effectively combining and selecting parameters for hardware and code optimizations in a short time. The maximum observed speedup is 15%. With the use of code optimizations, the maximum possible reduction of the hardware resources, while sustaining the same performance level, is 50%.Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Summary Purpose The study aims to evaluate the comprehensive relationship between patient satisfaction and five dimensions of health care service quality in Pakistani public/private health care sectors, using a novel grey relational analysis (GRA) models and the Hurwicz criteria of decision making under uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from private and public health care facilities of Pakistan through an improved SERVQUAL instrument. Deng's GRA, absolute GRA, and the second synthetic GRA models were applied to address the problem under study. Findings Grey relational analysis models revealed that reliability and responsiveness are most strongly predicting patient satisfaction in public and private health care sectors, respectively. The Hurwicz criteria showed that patients are more likely to be satisfied from private health care facilities. Limitations/implications Limitations of SERVQUAL model are also the limitations of the study; eg, the study suggests that because of the absence of ?cost,? which is a key quality indicator of Pakistani public sector health care facilities, the model was unable to comprehensively evaluate the health care situation in light of the observations of price-focused Pakistani patients. The study recommends tailoring of SERVQUAL model for the resource-scant and underdeveloped countries where people's evaluation of the quality of the hospitals is likely to be influenced by the price of services. Originality/value The study is a pioneer in health care evaluation of public and private sectors of Lahore and Rawalpindi while using GRA models, in general, and the second synthetic GRA model, in particular. It presents an alternative method to the statistical way of analyzing data by successfully demonstrating the use of grey methods, which can make reasonable decisions even through small samples.

N2  - In order to improve the efficiency of climate change initiatives China launched its national carbon market in December 2017. Initial CO2 quota allocations are a matter of significant concern. How should we allocate CO2 emissions reduction responsibilities among Chinese provinces, assuming that provinces will not or cannot trade these responsibilities among themselves? In this paper, we allocate CO2 quota from the perspective of cost minimisation. First, we estimate the national CO2 marginal abatement cost (MAC) function and deduce the interprovincial MAC functions. Second, we build an allocation model with nonlinear programming for cost minimisation. Finally, we obtain the allocation results under the emissions reduction target by 2030. The results are as follows. (i) The national MAC was 134.3 Yuan/t (at the constant price of 1978) in 2011, with an overall upward trend from 1990 to 2011. (ii) The interprovincial MACs differ significantly and decline gradually from east to west. Hebei has the largest emissions reduction quota, and Shandong has the largest emissions quota by 2030. (iii) Compared with other criteria of per capita, gross domestic product (GDP), grandfathering and carbon intensity, the proposed approach is the most cost-effective in achieving the reduction target, with cost savings of 37.7, 34.5, 47.9 and 33.87 per cent, respectively.

N2  - ABSTRACT In this article the financial/ownership structures of agribusiness cooperatives are analyzed to examine whether new cooperative models perform better than the more traditional ones. The assessment procedure introduces a new financial decision-aid approach, which is based on data-analysis techniques in combination with a preference ranking organization method of enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE II). The application of this multicriteria decision-aid approach allows the rank ordering of cooperatives based on the most prominent financial ratios. The financial ratios were selected using principal component analysis. This analytical procedure reduces the dimensionality of large numbers of interrelated financial performance measures. We assess the financial success of Dutch agribusiness cooperatives for the period 1999?2010. Results show that there is no clear-cut evidence that cooperative models used to attract extra members? investments and/or outside equity perform better than the more traditional models. This suggests that ownership structure of cooperatives is not always a decisive factor for their financial success. [EconLit citations: Q130, G320, C440].

N2  - Summary The waste heat management of the data center cooling systems has a significant share in the energy-efficient operations of the data centers. In this study, a new hybrid desalination-data center cooling system is proposed to reduce the cost drawback of the waste heat in the data center cooling operations. A two-phase liquid-immersion cooling unit is selected as the data center cooling method with the cooling load range of 0.7 to 1.5 kW. It is a promising solution thanks to the high heat flux removal performance but there is still a lack of research about waste heat management. The waste heat of the immersion cooling system is used to heat up the feed side of the desalination module. A direct contact membrane distillation system as preferred as the desalination module with the membrane area range of 5 to 75 cm2. The proposed hybrid system is investigated according to the thermodynamic, economic, and thermoeconomic aspects. The thermoeconomic assessment is done concerning the unique exergy-cost matrix of the original design. The maximum thermal and exergy efficiencies are found as 64.5% and 53.7%, respectively. The daily distilled water rate can reach 6.13?kg at the highest cooling load and membrane area. Compared to the stand-alone data center cooling operation, the hybrid system has higher capital and operation costs. The payback period is found 3.72?years that means the proposed system is economically feasible for real applications. Also, the levelized product cost of the hybrid design is calculated in the range of 2.69 to 5.33 SGD/h. In the multiobjective optimization study, the best trade-off point is decided at the cooling load of 1.1 kW whilst the membrane area varies between 5.12 and 5.19 cm2.

N2  - Abstract Making decisions by integrating social and environmental concerns beyond the financial dimension involves complex decision-making processes in which innovative approaches and best practices need to be implemented. Recently, the literature on decision-making related to sustainable development has grown rapidly, and multiple criteria decision making or analysis (MCDM/A) methods appear to be the most widely used approaches. The general objective of this paper is to provide a systematic review of the literature on the use of MCDM/A in a sustainable development context. We carefully analysed 343 papers dealing with decision-making in sustainable development contexts published in the last 7 years (2010-2017) using MCDM/A methods. Descriptive statistics were provided to highlight the main trends and gaps in the literature, and future research avenues were presented. The results show that although sustainable development strives to achieve a balance between the short and the long term, most articles surveyed did not investigate either the long-term perspective related to sustainable development or the unforeseen events that could impact future project evaluations. Indeed, the need for temporal MCDM/A methods under uncertainty emerges as an important research challenge. In addition, results show that the social dimension was the most frequently ignored dimension. In future research, decision-making processes should closely investigate social well-being and encourage the participation of stakeholders (including the communities affected). Finally, the recent research on sustainability is relatively easy to implement but may not lead to the desired outcome. Future research needs to develop methods that promote sustainability without being overly difficult to implement in practice.

N2  - Abstract Monitoring and managing the rapid growth of cities, especially in developing countries, highlights the need for appropriate spatio-temporal models to predict urban growth. The parameters affecting the spatio-temporal analysis of urban growth play a key role in the prediction results. This study proposes an urban growth simulation model by integrating local subjective?objective weights and decision risk values (ORness) into a CA?Markov model. This involves the use of ordered weighting averaging as one of the multicriteria decision analysis methods to combine the weights and degree of risk for generating a variety of risk-averse and/or risk-taking urban growth prediction scenarios. The proposed model has been applied to predict the physical growth of Babol city, located in Mazandaran, Iran. The results indicate that the degrees of ORness = 0.3 and ORness = 0.9 yield better prediction results in the case of using the local and global weighting strategies, respectively. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of local and global weighting strategies at different degrees of risk was 87.6 and 86.8, respectively. This implies that the use of local subjective?objective weights leads to more accurate results than the global weights for simulating urban growth.

N2  - Abstract To decide for the approval or rejection of a business loan application, banks are following a rating procedure. However, in many cases this procedure is not simply and properly structured. This may lead to unpleasant results so, for a long time, banks are struggling to find quite flexible and simple rating methods, widely applicable, easily comprehensible, and modifiable from their analysts. This study presents an empirical model of mass business rating with the use of multicriteria analysis (AHP method) and other techniques. Two main scenarios of a two-stage evaluation procedure will be analysed that demonstrate its flexibility, stability, and simplicity. The performance of this method is measured for both presented scenarios showing its capability. Furthermore, this method saves time and sources while ensuring the quality of the produced results. The outcome will be a list of rated businesses which, depending on the score they succeed in each of the two scenarios, will be approved or rejected for a business loan.

N2  - Appraising and improving the quality of teaching is a central issue all over the world. Using the Course Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), the current study examined the relationship between teaching quality dimensions and student satisfaction. The study evaluates the post-graduate students' perception of teaching quality and its relation with overall student satisfaction in context to state public universities of Punjab, India. Data were collected from 348 post-graduate in management students. Confirmatory factor analysis was applied to evaluate the measurement model, and a further Structured Equation Model was applied to test the proposed research hypotheses. The results reveal that clear goals and standards, generic skills, and appropriate assessment have a direct impact on the overall student satisfaction, whereas appropriate workload and good teaching skills have an indirect effect on the overall satisfaction. The female structural model replicated the findings of the overall model and showed that generic skills and clear goals are more important in student satisfaction. In contrast, the male structural model was quite different; only appropriate assessment has a direct impact on student satisfaction. Several implications for the improvement of post-graduate management teaching quality and quality assurance in terms of lecture delivery and course planning in-state public universities of India were further discussed.

N2  - Abstract Circular economy is a contemporary concept including usage of renewable materials and technologies. The transition to the circular economy creates value through closed-loop systems, reverse logistics, eco-design, product life cycle management, and clean production. The aim of the study was to propose a holistic conceptual framework for barriers of circular supply chain for sustainability in the textile industry. Within this aim, an in-depth literature review on barriers was conducted by covering all supply chain stages and circular initiatives in textile industry. Then, a focus group study was implemented. In the focus group study, barriers related to supply chains that prevent companies to implement the circular economy were discussed and validated. As a result, a total of 25 barriers were classified under nine main categories such as (a) management and decision-making, (b) labour, (c) design challenges, (d) materials, (e) rules and regulations, (f) lack of knowledge and awareness, (g) lack of integration and collaboration, (h) cost, and (i) technical infrastructure.

N2  - Abstract The concept of sustainability consists of three main dimensions: environmental, techno-economic, and social. Measuring the sustainability status of a system or technology is a significant challenge, especially when it needs to consider a large number of attributes in each dimension of sustainability. In this study, we first propose a hybrid approach, involving data envelopment analysis (DEA) and a multi-attribute decision making (MADM) methodologies, for computing an index for each dimension of sustainability, and then we define the overall sustainability index as the mean of the three measured indexes. Towards this end, we define new concepts of efficiency and cross-efficiency of order (p,?q) where p and q are the number of inputs and outputs, respectively. For a given (p,?q), we address the problem of finding efficiency of order (p,?q) by developing a novel DEA-based selecting method. Finally, we define the sustainability index as a weighted sum of all possible cross-efficiencies of order (p,?q). Form a computational viewpoint, the proposed selecting model significantly decreases the computational burden in comparison with the successive solving of traditional DEA models. A case study of the electricity-generation technologies in the United Kingdom is taken as a real-world example to illustrate the potential application of our method.

N2  - ABSTRACT Project selection problems are inherently complex problems with multiple and often conflicting objectives. The complexity of project selection problems is due to the high number of projects from which a subset (portfolio) has to be chosen. Various analytical methods, ranging from the simple weighted sum to complex mathematical programming have been proposed to solving these problems. We propose an integrated approach for strategic and sustainable project portfolio selection, which is composed of two distinct but interrelated modules. In the first module, we use the strategic planning and sustainability concepts to select a set of promising projects. In the second module, we use a project portfolio selection procedure to choose among the promising projects identified in the first module. A structural equation model is used to analyze and explain the relationships among different factors in the proposed framework. More specifically, we investigate the effects of: (1) strategic level performance on sustainability, post-implementation, and overall performance; (2) implementation performance on post-implementation and overall performance; (3) portfolio selection performance on implementation and overall performance; and (4) post-implementation performance on overall performance. A case study in investment banking is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and exhibit the efficacy of the procedures and algorithms.

N2  - One of the most important objectives of electricity distribution companies is to improve the reliability of the distribution networks. To this end, the electricity distribution companies try to optimally use the existing financial resources in the planning of preventive maintenance (PM) programs to reduce the imposed costs on the system due to the failure of network components and to improve the network reliability. In fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (fuzzy AHP) method, the degree of network reliability and the effectiveness of PM budget in the improvement of network reliability are selected as decision criteria in the budget allocation procedure. The areas served by the power distribution network are prioritized relative to each other and are assigned weights based on these priorities. The PM budget is determined based on the obtained weights. The medium voltage distribution network of seven areas in the city of Tehran have been selected for the implementation of the proposed method and the analysis of the obtained results. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Summary Recent advancements in web-based application, especially in cloud computing environment, allows cloud service providers to deploy and provide web-based services in the form of multitier applications. One of the most suitable infrastructure for the running of multitier applications is a cloud computing infrastructure. Since the arrival rate of users to the multitier applications varies over the time, deciding about the right amount of resources required to handle the each tier of multitier applications is not trivial, and it depends on the current workload of its each tier. Therefore, it is necessary to automatically provision resources to deal with fluctuating demands of the multitier applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid resource provisioning approach for multitier applications based on a combination of the concept of the autonomic computing and the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process approach. Moreover, we present a framework based on MAPE-k control loop for autonomous resource provisioning of multitier applications in cloud computing environments. The effectiveness of the proposed approach under real and synthetic workloads was evaluated. The experimental results indicate that the proposed solution outperforms in terms of allocated virtual machines, response time, and cost compared with the other approaches.

N2  - Abstract Beaches are an important recreational setting due to their provision of ideal open spaces for diverse water- and land-based recreation opportunities. Despite the importance of assessing the environmental justice of public beach access, few empirical studies have been conducted in community recreation. Using an environmental justice framework, this study examined whether inequities exist for certain racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups with respect to the distribution of public beach access in the Detroit Metropolitan Area. Results indicated that inequitable public beach access is associated with population density, median housing value, elderly population, and nonvehicle ownership. Such findings can help public leisure agencies to assess environmental justice, a first step in developing more effective community recreation planning and management policies. Study implications, limitations, and recommendations for further research are also discussed.

N2  - Abstract We propose a method for geometric areal object matching based on multi-criteria decision making. To enable this method, we focused on determining the matched areal object pairs that have all relations, one-to-one relationships to many-to-many relationships, in different spatial data sets by fusing geometric criteria without user invention. First, we identified candidate corresponding areal object pairs with a graph-based approach in training data. Second, three matching criteria (areal hausdorff distance, intersection ratio, and turning function distance) were calculated in candidate corresponding pairs and these criteria were normalized. Third, the shape similarity was calculated by weighted linear combination using the normalized matching criteria (similarities) with the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation method. Fourth, a threshold (0.738) of the shape similarity estimated in the plot of precision versus recall versus all possible thresholds of training data was applied, and the matched pairs were determined and identified. Finally, we visually validated the detection of similar areal feature pairs and conducted statistical evaluation using precision, recall, and F-measure values from a confusion matrix. Their values were 0.905, 0.848, and 0.876, respectively. These results validate that the proposed classifier, which detects 87.6% of matched areal pairs, is highly accurate.

N2  - Abstract This study proposes a robust prioritization framework for climate change adaptation strategies under uncertain climate change scenarios, using the VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method, a multi-criteria decision-making approach, together with the Shannon entropy-based weights. The VIKOR method allows us to find a compromise solution between two decision strategies of maximizing group utility and minimizing individual regret, and the Shannon entropy is used to determine objective weights among multiple climate change scenarios. The proposed methodology was applied to the problem of selecting locations of subwatersheds for reusing treated wastewater (TWW) in a Korean urban watershed. Selected based on the sustainability concept, hydro-environmental and socioeconomic indicators were used to evaluate the sustainability of TWW reuse under multiple climate change scenarios, using the hydrologic simulation model results and statistical data. Finally, sustainability scores under multiple scenarios were aggregated using the VIKOR together with the Shannon entropy-based weights for the robust prioritization of adaptation strategies. According to the different levels of regret aversion or affinity, our results for water quality showed different sets of adaptation strategies as the best options, suggesting that our framework would help stakeholders seeking the robust options considering both the utility and regret.

N2  - Abstract Using a case from the healthcare delivery sector, we demonstrate how a structured evaluation approach can facilitate the measurement of actual ICT contributions in various contexts. Typically, such are intricate due to the complexities inherent in the environments, making it difficult to evaluate the relationship between ICT and the benefits it intends to achieve to a reasonable degree. The approach suggested in this paper tries to partly remedy some of these complications, by facilitating qualitative data elicitations, aggregation, analysis and evaluation. To make this computationally meaningful, a decision support tool for handling numerically imprecise information is used for the data analysis and evaluation details. The results of this indicate that such an approach makes at least some meaningful input for practitioners and policymakers. In comparison to the qualitative in-depth approaches this approach facilitates a one-point in time assessment, which is less resource intensive, but provides prompt and substantial insight on the development performance of ICT4D initiatives. A similar approach would also be applicable to different sectors, and can utilize a broader scope of criteria, as well as incorporate views from several categories of stakeholders.

N2  - Abstract Course planning is one of the important problems in the education systems of universities. The processes cannot continue efficiently without planning, and various interruptions can appear in the system. This way decisions concerning which courses, when, how, and for what purposes should be answered by considering the available resources and stakeholders? preferences. Besides, universities aiming to be in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) have to adapt their systems to the Bologna process in order to create a lifelong student-centered, learning-oriented area based on quality assurance. In this study, an integrated approach based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and multichoice goal programming (MCGP) model was proposed to construct an efficient course plan following the Bologna process. The proposed approach was applied in an industrial engineering department.

N2  - Abstract This paper presents a new approach to multicriteria decision analysis. They were named as processing technique of ratings for ranking of alternatives (PROTERRA). The consecutive steps of the process include normalization of the ratings, calculating of the ratings ratios within each pair of the alternatives, creating a component matrix for each of the criteria, and creating a total matrix that is the sum of the weighted component matrices. Aggregated ratings of individual alternatives result from the sums of all the values of the corresponding rows and columns of the total matrix elements. A practical application of the PROTERRA has been illustrated with an example of a decision problem concerning the choice of a shopping centre location. The analysis results of the PROTERRA are compared with other results obtained using the most popular methods, that is, analytic hierarchy process, preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations, and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution. In order to assess the stability of the ranking order obtained by the PROTERRA algorithm, the influence of weights variations on the final ranking results were tested. The sensitivity analysis was also carried out for the other methods, that is, preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations, analytic hierarchy process, and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution. On this basis, a stability of rankings resulting from all analysed methods were compared.

N2  - Recently, a grid compatible Simplex variant has been demonstrated to identify optima consistently and rapidly in challenging high throughput (HT) applications in early bioprocess development. Here, this method is extended by deploying it to multi-objective optimization problems. Three HT chromatography case studies are presented, each posing challenging early development situations and including three responses which were amalgamated by the adoption of the desirability approach. The suitability of a design of experiments (DoE) methodology per case study, using regression analysis in addition to the desirability approach, was evaluated for a large number of weights and in the presence of stringent and lenient performance requirements. Despite the adoption of high-order models, this approach had low success in identification of the optimal conditions. For the deployment of the Simplex approach, the deterministic specification of the weights of the merged responses was avoided by including them as inputs in the formulated multi-objective optimization problem, facilitating this way the decision making process. This, and the ability of the Simplex method to locate optima, rendered the presented approach highly successful in delivering rapidly operating conditions, which belonged to the Pareto set and offered a superior and balanced performance across all outputs compared to alternatives. Moreover, its performance was relatively independent of the starting conditions and required sub-minute computations despite its higher order mathematical functionality compared to DoE techniques. These evidences support the suitability of the grid compatible Simplex method for early bioprocess development studies involving complex data trends over multiple responses. ? 2018 The Authors Biotechnology Progress published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

N2  - Abstract Due to the technological developments around the world, the amount of information that researchers work on increases continuously. This information density contains incomplete and uncertain data that cannot be fully expressed with crisp numbers. Fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and neutrosophic sets are useful tools to manage such information, but these concepts use a symmetrical and uniform scale to express data, whereas real-life problems contain nonsymmetrical and non-uniform information. Intuitionistic multiplicative sets (IMSs) are effective tools for dealing with these real-life problems. However, IMSs cannot handle real-life problems completely because indeterminate information depends on membership and non-membership information of IMSs, which is a restriction for decision makers and also for decision problems. To overcome this limitation, this paper generalizes the IMSs by using simplified neutrosophic set and introduces a novel approach that is called simplified neutrosophic multiplicative sets (SNMSs). Firstly, we define SNMS, show their set-based operations, and then give a description of simplified neutrosophic multiplicative numbers (SNMNs). Based on SNMNs, we develop two simplified neutrosophic multiplicative aggregation operators on SNMNs that are called simplified neutrosophic multiplicative weighted arithmetic average operator and simplified neutrosophic multiplicative weighted geometric average operator. Furthermore, we define some simplified neutrosophic multiplicative distance measures. Finally, using a model based on water-filling algorithm for determining criteria weights, we give a numerical example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the introduced concept with the proposed simplified neutrosophic multiplicative simplified neutrosophic multiplicative-TODIM method.

N2  - ABSTRACT With the rapid development of urbanization, urban environmental problems become a big challenge for urban socio-economic development planning. In this paper, a new Dynamic Assessment method, which integrates technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution, Entropy weight for time series data analysis, Grey relational analysis and Clustering, is proposed for urban eco-environmental quality assessment of the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta in China. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to identify the influence of weight or value changes of factors. The urban eco-environmental quality ranking by the proposed method is consistent with the Chinese city competitiveness rankings in 2009 by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. It is much easier and more efficient to obtain the urban eco-environmental quality ranking by the proposed method than by field studies and surveys. Copyright ? 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract Practical engineering design problems are inherently multiobjective, that is, require simultaneous control of several (and often conflicting) criteria. In many situations, genuine multiobjective optimization is required to acquire comprehensive information about the system of interest. The most popular solution techniques are population-based metaheuristics, however, they are not practical for handling expensive electromagnetic (EM)-simulation models in microwave and antenna engineering. A workaround is to use auxiliary response surface approximation surrogates but it is challenging for higher-dimensional problems. Recently, a deterministic approach has been proposed for expedited multiobjective design optimization of expensive models in computational EMs. The method relies on variable-fidelity EM simulations, tracking the Pareto front geometry, as well as response correction. The algorithm sequentially generates Pareto-optimal designs using a series of constrained single-objective optimizations. The previously obtained design is used as a starting point for the next iteration. In this work, we review this technique and its modification based on space mapping surrogates. We also propose new variations exploiting adjoint sensitivities, as well as response features, which can be attractive depending on availability of derivatives or the characteristics of the system responses that need to be handled. We also discuss several case studies involving various antenna and microwave components.

N2  - Abstract This survey reviews the growing literature on pairs trading frameworks, i.e., relative-value arbitrage strategies involving two or more securities. Research is categorized into five groups: The distance approach uses nonparametric distance metrics to identify pairs trading opportunities. The cointegration approach relies on formal cointegration testing to unveil stationary spread time series. The time-series approach focuses on finding optimal trading rules for mean-reverting spreads. The stochastic control approach aims at identifying optimal portfolio holdings in the legs of a pairs trade relative to other available securities. The category ?other approaches? contains further relevant pairs trading frameworks with only a limited set of supporting literature. Finally, pairs trading profitability is reviewed in the light of market frictions. Drawing from a large set of research consisting of over 100 references, an in-depth assessment of each approach is performed, ultimately revealing strengths and weaknesses relevant for further research and for implementation.

N2  - Summary The emergence of data engineering along with the support of Online Social Networks is growing by millions every day due to the introduction of wireless systems and Internet of Things. The rapid growth of usage of smart devices helps to create new generation knowledge sharing platforms. Data Analytics has a major role to play in the growth and success of wireless and IoT applications. The growth of data has become exponential and is difficult to analyze. Many researchers depend on the data available on Wireless Systems and IoT for developing new generation services and applications. With the opportunity of information and communication technologies like heterogeneous networking, cloud computing, web services, crowd sensing and data mining, ubiquitous and asynchronous information sharing is feasible. But this also brings out a lot of provocations with respect to conflicting standards, data portability, data aggregation, data distribution, differential context and communication overhead. The smart information and communication technology has changed many features of human lifestyle: personal and work places.

N2  - Abstract The sustainability impact of air transportation has become crucial to communities. Airports around the world are forced to be transparent with the society and to declare their sustainability results. As the sustainability goals and objectives and due to its multi-dimension aspects that are needed to be decided of and subsequently improved, the decision has been taken, and the parameters have been selected due to its significance in this field. This research presents a managerial approach combining the optimization-based frontier approach with the Global Report Initiative's comprehensive sustainability database for selected 30 major international airports based on data availability. In this regard, eco-efficiency analysis is carried out with four different models using input-oriented modeling with multiple undesirable environmental inputs (energy, carbon, water, and waste) and desirable outputs (revenue, passenger and employment) to compare efficiency and sustainability levels of airports in different contexts. Finally, performance improvement targets of each environmental indicators are presented for the airports. These comparative models reveal different frontier airports, which provide the opportunity to analyze diversified reference points for the same decision-making unit. The presented statistical study has shown that San Francisco, Hong Kong, Hamad International Airport are the most efficient airports in terms of overall sustainability performance based on collected data and selected indicators. The authors also concluded that there is a discrepancy in sustainability data reporting between airports, and there is a need for collecting complete, consistent and real-time social, environmental, economic, and governance data, to better compare and evaluate the performance of each airport from a sustainability perspective.

N2  - Architectured beam lattice materials whose anisotropy can be tuned by varying the composition of their elementary cell are investigated. As an exemplary prototype of such material architecture, a regular triangular lattice with an elementary cell composed of 12 beams is considered. One out of three possible values of the elastic modulus is assigned to each beam. The structure is fully defined by a vector in the 12D composition-structure space whose components are given by the elastic modulus values of the beams comprising the elementary cell. The elastic properties of this 2D material are represented by the compliance elasticity tensor with six independent compliance coefficients. Aiming at a specific set of properties thus involves finding the point in the 12D composition-structure space that corresponds to a given point in the 6D property space. This is a problem of large dimensionality. To solve it, the neural network approach is used. This enables creation of architectured materials with tunable elastic anisotropy. A chiral element combining large twist with additional anisotropy requirements is presented as an example of successful machine-learning-based optimization of beam lattices proposed.

N2  - Energy is one of the main factors that must be considered in the discussions of sustainable development. Renewable, clean and cost effective energy sources are preferred but unfortunately no one of the alternative energy sources can meet these demands solely. So, the problem of determining the appropriate energy policy is a multiple criteria decision making problem. In this study, firstly sustainability indicators for energy planning are determined. Then dependencies and feedbacks between indicators and the values of the indicators were investigated and it was seen that Analytic Network Process with benefits, opportunities, costs and risks merits is a suitable method for this complex problem. Both the objective values and group decision of experts were used in the model to cover the quantitative and qualitative judgments. The results indicated that the energy system of Turkey is not sustainable and the sustainable energy scenario of Turkey must increase the share of renewables. This article is an important framework for the sustainable development pathway of Turkey. ? 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 36: 627?637, 2017

N2  - Abstract Perishable food supply chains (PFSCs) are characterized with rising food quality and safety concerns, alarming food wastages and losses, and poor economic sustainability. Because of the perishable nature of products and limited shelf life, management of sustainability in PFSCs is critical. Many studies on sustainability in PFSCs have considered developed countries; however, developing countries have not gathered the required research attention in this domain. In this paper, a decision theory-based framework is adopted, where a prescriptive decision analysis methodology is used to generate preferences among the challenges to sustainability in PFSC. An integrated interpretive structural modelling?analytic network process (ISM?ANP) decision framework is formulated to identify and model key challenges to sustainability in PFSCs, keeping a developing economy like India under consideration. The contextual relationships amongst the extracted challenges are analyzed using the ISM methodology. The relationships identified from ISM are used as inputs in the ANP methodology, to generate the priority weights of the challenges. The findings of the integrated methodology show that ?lack of horizontal integration of farmers,? ?poor pre-harvest management,? and ?lack of government regulation and support? are the most critical challenges for sustainability in PFSCs. The results show that organizations must work on aggregation of farm produce and integration of farmers with the market. Development of infrastructures and cold chain facilities at the farm level is necessary to mitigate these challenges to reduce wastages in PFSC. The study facilitates managers and planners to understand and enable sustainable practices in PFSCs.

N2  - Summary In this paper, the multiple objectives optimization problem in a finite-state model predictive control (FS-MPC) is formulated using fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making. Conventionally, to optimize the multiple objectives in a FS-MPC, the aggregate objective function or a single cost function is constructed, which requires the weighting factor tuning to select the appropriate switching state. Determination of these weighting factors for a particular objective function is a complex and time-consuming task as no systematic procedure is available in literature. The main aim of this paper is to replace the time-consuming task of weighting factor tuning by a simple and systematic procedure, which relies on the relative importance of the individual objective functions. The relative importance of objective functions derived from the expert's knowledge and the desired control objectives is used for appropriate switching state selection. The method is validated with the help of simulation results of a neutral point clamped inverter for the multiple objectives viz. reference current tracking, capacitor voltage balance and switching frequency minimization. The result outcomes of the proposed methodology are compared with the conventional FS-MPC and space vector pulse width modulation based current control schemes.

N2  - Abstract The value creation wheel (VCW) is the decision-making meta-framework recommended to address innovation, collaboration, and change challenges in formal relationships. The VCW can integrate, complement, or be joined with other frameworks, tools, and theories to address the challenges of formal relationships. The VCW's ability to incorporate intra- and interorganizational insights emerging from internal and external stakeholders is especially useful in solving the challenges of collaborative arrangements. VCW solutions are often more realistic than Design Thinking, Creative Problem-Solving, and Lean because they accommodate the views of various stakeholders about ideas and filters, and because key decision makers must be involved in the main stages of the decision-making process.

N2  - Abstract Flooding is a major natural disaster that has brought tremendous losses to mankind throughout the ages. Even so, floods can be controlled by appropriate measures to minimize loss and damage. Flood risk assessment is an essential analytic step in preventing floods and reducing losses. Identifying previous flood risk and predicting future features are conducive to understanding the changing patterns and laws of flood risk. Taking the Dongjiang River basin as a study case, we assessed and regionalized flood risk in 1990, 2000, and 2010 from the past perspective and explored dynamic expansion during 1990?2010. Then, we projected land-use type, population, and gross domestic product in 2030 and 2050 and finally assessed and regionalized the risk from a future perspective. Results show that areas with very high risk accounted for 14.98?18.08% during 1990?2010; approximately 13.90% areas of the basin transformed from lower-level risk to higher-level risk whereas 9.07% fell from a higher level to a lower level during the period. For the future scenario, areas with very high and high risk in 2030 and 2050 are expected to account for 21.55% and 24.84%, respectively. Generally, our study can better identify changes in flood risk at a spatial scale and reveal the dynamic evolution rule, which provides a synthetical means of flood prevention and reduction, flood insurance, urban planning, and water resource management in the future under global climate change, especially for developing or high-speed urbanization regions.

N2  - Intuitionistic fuzzy set plays a vital role in decision making, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. Many decision-making problems consist of different types of datum, where fuzzy set theoretical approaches may fail to obtain the optimal decision. Numerous approaches for intuitionistic fuzzy decision-making problem have been introduced in the literature to overcome these short comings. But there is no single approach that can be used to solve all kinds of problems because of the partial ordering defined on the collection of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs). Even though ranking of fuzzy numbers have been studied from early seventies in the last century, a total order on the entire class of fuzzy numbers has been introduced by Wang and Wang (Fuzzy Sets Syst 2014, 243, 131?141) only on 2014. A total order on the collection of all IFN is an open problem till today. In this article, a total order on the entire class of IFN using upper lower dense sequence in the interval [0, 1] is proposed and compared with existing techniques using illustrative examples, further an algorithm (which is problem independent) for solving any intuitionistic fuzzy multicriteria decision-making problem (Intuitionistic fuzzy MCDM) is introduced. This new total ordering on IFNs generalizes the total ordering defined in Wang and Wang () for fuzzy numbers. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Complexity 21: 54?66, 2016

N2  - Abstract Freshwater ecosystems are under a constant risk of being irreversibly damaged by human pressures that threaten their biodiversity, the sustainability of ecosystem services (ESs), and human well-being. Despite the implementation of various environmental regulations, the challenges of safeguarding freshwater assets have so far not been tackled successfully. A promising way forward to stop the loss of freshwater biodiversity and to sustain freshwater-based ESs is by implementing ecosystem-based management (EBM), an environmental planning and adaptive management approach that jointly considers social and ecological needs. Responsible for considerable recent success in sustainably managing and conserving marine ecosystems, EBM has not yet been championed for fresh waters. A major reason for the delayed uptake of EBM in fresh waters is likely to be its complexity, requiring planners to be familiar with the latest developments in a range of different research areas. EBM would therefore benefit from becoming more tangible to receive attention on the ground. To facilitate uptake, eight core research areas for EBM and their innovations are introduced, and the way in which they feed into the workflow that guides the EBM planning stage is explained. The workflow links biodiversity distributions with ES supply-and-demand modelling and SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely) target planning, including scenario- and cross-realm perspectives, the prioritization of management alternatives, spatial prioritization of biodiversity conservation and ES areas, and the quantification of uncertainties. Given the extensive resources, time, and technical capacity required to implement the full workflow, a light and an ultralight version of the workflow are also provided. Applied in concert, the eight well-known research areas allow for better planning and operationalizing, and eventually for implementing EBM in freshwater ecosystems. EBM has great potential to increase public acceptance by introducing the consideration of human needs and aspirations into typically biodiversity-driven conservation and management approaches. This will ultimately improve the integrity of freshwater ecosystems.

N2  - With the rapid increase of component outsourcing, suppliers play more important roles in New Product Development (NPD) projects. Previous research has shown that the selection of the appropriate supplier, as well as the choice of both the time and the degree of its involvement, have a major impact on NPD performance. However, the customer firms involved in this activity of collaborative design with suppliers express a need for methods and tools in order to effectively manage these particular relations. This paper presents a framework for the measurement of supplier's performance in the context of NPD projects. This framework has been supported by evidence from the literature and feedbacks from practitioners. It has been developed iteratively by application of an action research approach conducted within six industrial French companies. This development enabled the generation of a robust framework that allows: (a) identifying four main areas of performance expected by the customer in collaborative setting and (b) evaluating suppliers' development efforts throughout the NPD project with appropriate criteria for each stage of the project.

N2  - Abstract:? This article introduces a system called Construction Quality Management Audit (CQMA) Expert that assesses the performance of a quality management system (QMS) implemented in a construction firm. CQMA Expert is programmed by using MATLAB's GUI components and its Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. CQMA Expert's rule base is constructed using information obtained from auditors of QMSs. CQMA Expert imports the quality requirements relative to the many quality management processes specified in ISO 9000, processes audit inputs, and generates consistent decisions relative to conformance to standards. It provides an interactive user interface for recording evidence collected during the audit and clearly states the reasons for the conclusions. It contributes to continuous quality improvement because (1) it enhances the maintenance of a QMS by quantifying its performance, (2) it assists with and facilitates the implementation of the duties of auditors in charge of assessing the performance of a QMS, (3) it simplifies the burdensome process involved in keeping track of the audit results of the many quality management processes investigated, and (4) it reduces the impact of the variability caused by the use of different auditors assessing different quality management processes. Case studies based on Section 4.11 of the ISO 9000 standard entitled ?Control of inspection, measuring and test equipment? are used to illustrate the system and verify its usability and validity.

N2  - If a rubber fender, whose purpose is to absorb the shock energy that is generated when a ship is berthing, fails because of deterioration and vulcanization, the ship and the pier structure may incur serious damage. In this paper, we introduce a fuzzy rule-based decision-making system to predict the maintenance timing of rubber fenders by diagnosing their faults and evaluating their lifetimes on the basis of the knowledge and experience of experts. First, we built a case library containing information concerning fender lifetimes and points in these lifetimes when faults occurred. This was gathered on the basis of the results of testing the lifetime of rubber materials under accelerated conditions and a knowledge base of the physical properties of fenders in order to evaluate the deterioration in a rubber fender. Moreover, after representing the key factors affecting the deterioration of rubber fenders as a fuzzy cognitive map that reflects the knowledge and experience of domain experts, we drew inferences regarding the heuristic factors of the lifetime of rubber, the conceptual centrality of which is relatively high according to the cause-and-effect relationship between key factors. Finally, we propose a diagnostic process for the performance deterioration of rubber fenders based on the various factors that affect the lifetime of rubber and its multiple physical properties in the form of a decision-making tree. We then applied it to rule-based and case-based reasoning. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is now a key contributor worldwide in the transition towards low-carbon electricity systems. To date, PV commonly receives subsidies in order to accelerate adoption rates by increasing investor returns. However, many aleatory and epistemic uncertainties exist with regard to these potential returns. In order to manage these uncertainties, an innovative probabilistic approach using Bayesian networks has been applied to the techno-economic analysis of domestic solar PV. Empirical datasets from over 600 domestic PV systems, together with national domestic electricity usage datasets, have been used to generate and calibrate prior probability distributions for PV yield and domestic electricity consumption, respectively, for typical urban housing stock. Subsequently, conditional dependencies of PV self-consumption with regard to PV generation and household electricity consumption have been simulated via stochastic modelling using high temporal resolution demand and PV generation data. A Bayesian network model is subsequently applied to deliver posterior probability distributions of key parameters as part of a discounted cash flow analysis. The results illustrate the sensitivity of PV investment returns to parameters such as PV self-consumption, PV degradation rates and geographical location and quantify inherent uncertainties when evaluating the impact of sector-specific PV adoption upon economic indicators. The outcomes are discussed in terms of the value and impact of this new Bayesian approach in terms of supporting robust and rigorous policy and investment decision-making, especially in post-subsidy contexts globally. ? 2016 The Authors.

N2  - Summary In recent years, critical infrastructures and power systems in particular have been subjected to sophisticated cyberthreats, including targeted attacks and advanced persistent threats. A promising response to this challenging situation is building up enhanced threat intelligence (TI) that interlinks information sharing and fine-grained situation awareness. In this paper, a framework that integrates all levels of TI, ie, strategic, tactical, operational, and technical, is presented. The platform implements the centralized model of information exchange with peer-to-peer interactions between partners as an option. Several supportive solutions were introduced, including anonymity mechanisms or data processing and correlation algorithms. A data model that enables communication of cyberincident information, both in natural language and machine-readable formats, was defined. Similarly, security requirements for critical components were devised. A pilot implementation of the platform was developed and deployed in the operational environment, which enabled practical evaluation of the design. Also, the security of the anonymity architecture was analyzed.

N2  - AbstractA major drawback associated with the use of classical statistical methods for business failure prediction on top of financial distress is their lack of high accuracy rate. This work analyses the use of the two-stage ensemble of multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) and logit to improve predictive performance of classical statistical methods. All possible ratios are firstly built from the quantities involved and then the three common filters, that is stepwise MDA, stepwise logit, and t-test, are used to choose another three convenient subsets of ratios. Four principal components spaces (PCSs) are, respectively, produced on the four different feature spaces by using principal components analysis. MDA and logit are used to produce predictions on the four PCSs. After that, two levels of ensemble are implemented: one based on predictions inside each of the same type of model (i.e. MDA or logit) and another based on the former two ensembles and one best model. Each of the eight models is weighted on the base of ranking order information of its predictive accuracy in ensemble by majority voting. MDA and logit and the new challenge model of support vector machine respectively in their best standalone modes are used for comparisons. Empirical results indicate that the two-stage ensemble of MDA and logit compares favourably with the three comparative models and all its component models.

N2  - Abstract Defects of hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) manifest in actual decision-making process, so adding probabilities to the values in HFS is necessary. The probabilistic HFS (PHFS) is a useful tool to describe the uncertainty of elements in HFS by introducing occurrence probabilities. However, some important issues in PHFS utilization remain to be addressed. In this study, an outranking method for multicriteria decision making (MCDM) with probabilistic hesitant information is presented. First, the binary relations between two probabilistic hesitant fuzzy elements (PHFEs) are defined on the basis of the elimination and choice translating reality method. Some outranking relations between the alternatives are then introduced. Second, we provide a Hausdorff distance between two PHFEs. The main characteristic of the proposed Hausdorff distance is that it does not require the same length and arrangement of the PHFEs. Third, a maximizing Hausdorff distance deviation method is developed to obtain the evaluation criteria weights under a probabilistic hesitant fuzzy environment. Finally, an illustrative example in conjunction with comparative analysis is used to demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible for practical MCDM problems.

N2  - An approach for rapid optimization of ultra-high-performance supercritical fluid chromatographic (UHPSFC) gradient by response surface methodology was developed for fast separation of complex crude extracts of the leaves of Rosa sericea. The optimization was performed with Box?Behnken designs and the multicriteria response variables were described using Derringer's desirability. Based on factorial design experiments, five factors were selected for Box?Behnken designs to optimize the UHPSFC conditions, which led to 46 experiments being performed within 8 h. An evaporative light-scattering detector (ELSD) was used, and quantitative analysis of main components in R. sericea samples was employed to evaluate the statistical significance of the parameters on UHPSFC-ELSD analytes response. The results indicated that the optimized UHPSFC-ELSD method is very sensitive with LODs and LOQs below 1.19 and 4.55 ?g/mL, respectively. The overall intra- and interday variations were less than 3.91 and 6.41%, respectively. The recovery of the method ranged from 95.66 to 104.22%, with RSD < 5.91%. This newly developed UHPSFC-ELSD method was demonstrated to be fast and sensitive in analyzing complex herbal extracts of Traditional Chinese Medicines.

N2  - ABSTRACT Firms are seeking ways to improve managerial decision making in order to enhance operational performance. However, the complexities underlying business processes often mean that operational performance depends on a multitude of factors. Yet, at times the number of empirical cases is rather limited. This presents the challenge of discerning meaningful patterns among a large number of variables that can then be used to derive generalized frameworks and mental models for decision making. In this article, we tackle this challenge with an extension of Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation (SICE), a novel data mining technique, to address decisions in Operations and Supply Chain Management. We conduct a simulation study to validate the effectiveness of this extension in improving the accuracy and stability of pattern detection. We then apply it to an empirical dataset that is characterized by high dimension, low sample size, and lack of multivariate normal distribution. Our study pioneers the application of SICE in Operations and Supply Chain research. We also extend SICE with bootstrapping. The extended SICE is an effective technique for mining a complex empirical dataset and is a valuable aid for decision support.

N2  - Abstract Evaluating the information quality of cQA (community question-answering) websites helps users select a cQA website with high-quality information and improves the information quality. In this paper, an approach to evaluating the information quality of cQA based on a novel hybrid multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) model is proposed. First, the source, content, expression and usefulness criteria for evaluating the information quality of the cQA are established. Then, considering the ambiguity and inner correlations of the criteria, DANP ([DEMATEL]-based Analytic Network Process) and TODIM (interactive and multiple attribute decision making, in Portuguese) methods are combined in a two-dimensional linguistic environment to process linguistic evaluation information. Lastly, the proposed approach is applied to evaluate the quality of five popular cQA websites. The key criteria are identified, and the evaluation results are derived comprehensively. The key factors consist of reputation, coverage, politeness, usability, helpfulness, clarity, readability and conciseness. The websites, Know almost and Baidu knows, perform better in terms of information quality. The application, along with the sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis, shows the effectiveness of the proposed model. The proposed approach has both practical and research implications. It provides an approach for users to choose websites, and, for operators, to improve the information quality of their website. The evaluation criteria and their relations provide a reference for research on the information quality. The evaluation method considers the user's psychological information to provide a more accurate MCDM approach. The comprehensive aspects of the experiment can be used to verify the other MCDM methods.

N2  - The traditional reliability demonstration testing based on statistical method requires a large number of samples and long testing time, failing to satisfy the demand for short cycle and low cost. This paper proposes a new accelerated approach for determining reliability target of each environment stress, accelerated test profile, and comprehensive acceleration factor for multi-failure mode product to conduct assembly level accelerated demonstration testing under multiple stresses and levels. By decomposing the product from four levels, namely function, structure, mechanism, and stress, the products' weaknesses can be identified. The main failure modes and sensitive environmental stresses are determined based on environmental profile and FMMEA. In this design, the reliability is apportioned to each actual environmental stress by AHP. And the SSI model is used to establish accelerated stress profile. The overall acceleration factor can be derived from the model of assembly level accelerated testing. Combined with a statistical plan, the accelerated reliability demonstration testing plan and test profile is built. A case example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Aiming at the counterintuitive phenomena of the Dempster?Shafer method in combining the highly conflictive evidences, a combination method of evidences based on the clustering analysis is proposed in this paper. At first, the cause of conflicts is disclosed from the point of view of the internal and external contradiction. And then, a new similarity measure based on it is proposed by comprehensively considering the Pignistic distance and the sequence according to the size of the basic belief assignments over focal elements. This measure is used to calculate the commonality function of evidences to amend the evidence sources; Meanwhile, the Iterative Self-organizing Data Analysis Techniques Algorithm (ISODATA) method based on the new measure is used for clustering according to the clustering characters of the original evidences. The Dempster rule is applied to combining all the evidences in each clustering into an evidential representative, and the reliability is calculated based on the commonality and the occurrence frequency of the evidences in the clustering. At last, Murphy's method is used to combine these evidential representatives of the different clusterings. The experimental results through a series of numeric examples show that the method proposed in this paper is more effective and superior to others.

N2  - Abstract This paper introduces a new procedure for handling the multicriteria ABC inventory classification problem using stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis. All possible preferences among the evaluation criteria have been considered. Due to the fact that even under certain preference, it is difficult to reach a group consensus on the exact weight values along with each criterion, we calculate preference-specific intervals under each preference and then formulate a stochastic decision-making problem. To tackle this problem, we consider different distribution functions of the intervals and then compute the holistic acceptability indices to classify stock-keeping units. The results derived from our method are compared to the previous results to show the robustness and superiority of our method.

N2  - Abstract In this paper, we study the well-known Bonferroni mean and develop its generalized aggregation operators in the Pythagorean fuzzy environment. More specifically, by considering the interrelationship between arguments with Pythagorean fuzzy information, we develop the Pythagorean fuzzy Bonferroni mean (PFBM) and some special properties and cases of them are also discussed. Furthermore, taking the multicriteria decision making environment into consideration, we extend the results of PFBM and develop the weighted Pythagorean fuzzy Bonferroni mean (WPFBM). Meanwhile, we also propose an approach for the application of WPFBM. However, during the application of the WPFBM operator, the calculation is very complex and time consuming. Hence, we introduce the multithreading into the application of the WPFBM operator and develop an accelerative calculating algorithm for it. To validate the performance of the accelerative calculating algorithm, we further design the corresponding experimental analysis.

A pulsed Nd:YAG laser welding machine was employed herein. The welding parameters that in?uence the pulsed Nd:YAG laser welding quality was evaluated by measuring the tensile-shear strength. In this study, the Taguchi method was used to perform the initial optimization of the process parameters. A neural network (NN) with the Levenberg?Marquardt back-propagation algorithm was adopted to develop the nonlinear relationship between factors and the response. Then, a genetic algorithm based on a well-trained NN model was applied to determine the optimal factor settings. Experimental results illustrated the proposed approach.

N2  - Abstract Since Apple merged with AuthenTec, a leading fingerprint recognition company, in 2012, biometrics has widely been considered to strengthen security and privacy in the network security field. Although biometrics has been applied in specific areas for decades, it has gradually proliferated in customer and mobile electronic products to enhance security and privacy. This study aims to evaluate biometrics through conventional technology assessment considerations combined with viewpoints on the specifics of biometric technologies and then to provide suggestions for selection. To conduct the biometric technology assessment, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and non-fuzzy best performance approaches are used. Although the outcomes first indicate that technology assessment should be the key object in selecting biometric technologies, that object is followed by biometric competence and key elements of biometrics. The outcomes also indicate that features of the target technologies should be considered when evaluating them. Additionally, fingerprint recognition, iris recognition, and face recognition are the preferred biometrics in evaluation and selection. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract The cold-chain information has characterized by the loss and dispersion according to the different collecting methods. The description for the quality decay factors of aquatic products can be defined as the multidimensional information. A series of nodes with multidimensional information are assembled to be hierarchies aiming at describing the environment conditions and locations in the supply chain. Each of the single hierarchy levels constitutes a sequence of node information in a network, which is applied as internal information analysis. The cross-layer information structure is defined as ?bridge? information which is able to record the information transmissions among every hierarchy from the point of view of the whole chain. The study has established a novel structured modeling to describe the cold chain of aquatic products based on a network-hierarchy framework. An organized and sustainable transmission process can be built and recorded by the multidimensional attributes for the whole course of cold chain of aquatic products. In addition, seamless connections among every hierarchy are attainable by the environmental information records continuously to monitor the quality of aquatic products. The quality assessments and shelf life predictions are estimated properly as the risk control in order to monitor and trace the safety of aquatic products under the supply chain perspective.

N2  - On the basis of the normal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (NIFNs), we proposed the normal interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (NIVIFNs) in which the values of the membership and nonmembership were extended to interval numbers. First, the definition, the properties, the score function and accuracy function of the NIVIFNs are briefly introduced, and the operational laws are defined. Second, some aggregation operators based on the NIVIFNs are proposed, such as normal interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted arithmetic averaging operator, normal interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted arithmetic averaging operator, normal interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid weighted arithmetic averaging operator, normal interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric averaging operator, normal interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted geometric averaging operator, normal interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid weighted geometric averaging operator, and normal interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy generalized weighted averaging operator, normal interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy generalized ordered weighted averaging operator, normal interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy generalized hybrid weighted averaging operator, and some properties of these operators, such as idempotency, monotonicity, boundedness, commutativity, are studied. Further, an approach to the decision making problems with the NIVIFNs is established. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Complexity 21: 277?290, 2016

N2  - Abstract Water shortage is a common problem around the world, especially in developing countries. Water shortage is closely linked to natural and social conditions, but the linkages between these natural and social conditions and their underlying temporal and spatial variation are less well explored. This paper details an application of the Driving-Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model, a holistic and sustainable tool for resources planning and management, and uses comprehensive weights to evaluate the water poverty (wp) in China from 1997 to 2014. This study applies the Kernel density estimation model to analyze the temporal variation trend and uses the least square error model to analyze the spatial pattern of wp. The results show the level of wp is gradually declining over time and the improvements in the coastal and inland wp situation are not spatially harmonious, and there are four primary types of wp in China based on drivers and causal mechanisms: D-P-I, D-P-I-R, D-P-S-I, and D-P-S-I-R. Furthermore, we analyze the main causes of spatial difference of wp and put forward corresponding countermeasures. The research findings are intended to provide a new insight for the evaluation of wp in the context of sustainable development, breaking past limitations that arise in simplified analyses using a single method, and to provide a strategy for regional water resources management to relieve wp.

N2  - Water shortage is a common problem around the world, especially in rural areas of developing countries. Water shortage is closely linked to natural and social conditions, and the linkages between these natural and social conditions and their underlying spatial and temporal variations are less well explored in rural areas. The water poverty index (WPI) is a holistic tool for resource planning and management and is an effective tool in solving water shortage problems in developing countries through water resources managements. This study defines five components and 19 indicators using the WPI and assigns integrated weights to measure water poverty in rural China from 1997 to 2016. The results show that the level of water poverty has been gradually declining over time, and the improvements in the coastal and inland water poverty situation are not harmonious. This study also analyzes spatial and temporal variations of water poverty in rural China by the kernel estimation (KDE) and the exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) models. Hence, specific areas require special policy interventions. The research findings are intended to provide a new insight for the evaluation of water poverty in the context of sustainable development and to provide a strategy for regional water resource management to relieve rural water poverty in developing countries.

N2  - Abstract Academic collaboration plays an important role in undergraduate research. Current methods rely on offline social contacts for undergraduate students to collaborate with academic staff members in universities and research institutions. In big data era, it is difficult for undergraduate students to find suitable research project opportunities and supervisors to work with. This paper proposes a social recommendation system for undergraduate students to find research project opportunities and work with research project teams on an academic collaboration network. The proposed recommendation method integrates relevance, connectivity, and quality modules, where profiles of undergraduates are constructed with their self-claimed information, research activities (e.g., studying and reading research publications and reading research projects), and social connections in the academic collaboration network. Suitable research projects are recommended based on the undergraduates' profiles. Experiments are conducted, and the results have shown that the proposed social recommendation system can facilitate undergraduates' selection of research projects.

N2  - Abstract Several papers have studied inventory classification in order to group items with a view to facilitating their management. The generated classes are then coupled with the specific reorder policies composing the overall inventory control system. However, the effectiveness of inventory classification and control system is strictly interrelated. That is to say, different classification approaches could show different performance if applied to a different set of reorder policies, and vice versa. Furthermore, when the cost structure is subjected to uncertainty, a pure cost-based analysis of the inventory control system could be corrupted. This paper presents a multicriteria framework for the concurrent selection of the item classification approach and the inventory control system through a discrete-event simulation approach. The key performance indicators provided by the simulator (i.e., average holding value, average number of backorders, and average number of emitted orders) are indicative of the multidimensional effectiveness of the adopted inventory control system when coupled with a specific classification approach. By this way, a multicriteria problem arises, where the alternatives are given by exhaustively coupling the item classes, which are generated by different classification approaches, with the reorder policies composing the inventory system. An analytical hierarchy process is then used for selecting the best alternative, as well as for evaluating the effect of the weights assigned to the key performance indicators through a sensitivity analysis. This approach has been validated in a real case study with a company operating in the field of electrical resistor manufacturing, with a view of facilitating the management of items showing intermittent demand.

N2  - Abstract Mainstream conceptualizations of sustainable development (SD) tend to focus on urban areas or the national or global scale?most recently through the Sustainable Development Goals. This focus often overlooks rural and natural resource-based communities, particularly those dependent on renewable resources like fisheries or forestry. Drawing from a comprehensive review, we propose an alternative approach for interpreting and measuring SD in these contexts. We integrate two seemingly contradictory approaches: sustainability indicators (SIs), whose evolution reflects competing views of the nature of knowledge and action in pursuit of SD, and the use of storytelling in policy and planning, highlighting how actors tell stories to garner support for proposed developments, influence public understanding, and mobilize stakeholders. Examining the opposing epistemologies often underlying these two approaches, we posit that they can be brought together through a transdisciplinary lens for sustainable rural development. We illustrate these potentials in Newfoundland and Labrador, a highly resource-based region in which rural communities are often characterized by deficiencies based narratives. In such contexts, storytelling can allow rural stakeholders to interpret SD while potentially enlisting SIs in telling their own sustainability stories.

N2  - Summary Many hospitals encounter surgery cancelations for various reasons. We present a methodology applying data mining and simulation to optimize operating room (OR) scheduling in a urology department in West China Hospital. To the best of our knowledge, this is 1 of the first efforts to seek an optimal schedule solution based on cancelation risk of elective surgeries as well as OR allocation between elective and nonelective surgeries. First, chi-square test and random forest prediction modeling were used to predict potential elective surgeries with high cancelation risk, and the factors, including surgeon, number of days since admission of patient, first surgery or not, etc., that influence elective surgery cancelation were identified. Second, a simulation technology was designed to compare 7 different scheduling strategies. The results demonstrated that for elective surgery, cancelation rate low surgery first outperformed the others and increased the productivity of the ORs from 72% to 83%, while for nonelective surgery performed in a separate OR, there was no improvement because the supply was greater than necessary at present. However, in total, the selected strategies led to 7% higher productivity.

Methods: Important relationships between a patient's basic information and their clinical features before and during the radiation treatment are identified from historical clinical data by using statistical learning and data mining approaches. During each treatment period, a data analysis (DA) module predicts radiotherapy features such as time to local progression (TTLP), time to distant metastases (TTDM), radiation toxicity to different organs, etc., under possible future treatment plans based on patient specifics or responses. An information fusion (IF) module estimates intervals for a patient's OS and the probabilities of RIT from a treatment plan by integrating the outcomes of module DA. A decision making (DM) module calculates ?satisfaction? with the predicted radiation outcome based on trade-offs between OS and RIT, and finds the best treatment plan for the next time period via multi-criteria optimization. Results: Using physical and biological data from 130 lung cancer patients as our test bed, we were able to train and implement the 3 modules of our decision support tool. Examples demonstrate how it can help predict a new patient's potential OS and RIT with different radiation dose plans along with how these combinations change with dose, thus presenting a range of satisfaction/utility for use in individualized decision support. Conclusion: Although the decision support tool is currently developed from a small patient sample size, it shows the potential for the improvement of each patient's satisfaction in personalized radiation therapy. The radiation treatment outcome prediction and decision making model needs to be evaluated with more patients and demonstrated for use in radiation treatments for other cancers.

N2  - Abstract The main approaches for the television scheduling design are commonly based on the ratings or revenues maximization objective, and thus, only a single optimal solution can be obtained, corresponding to the best result for the considered objective. Therefore, these approaches lead up to the alternative solutions loss which, even if less effective from the ratings or revenues maximization viewpoint, may be more suitable for the decision maker because of better compromise in relation to factors influencing the decision process. Specifically, such a compromise could be achieved through a suitable ?trade-off? between these factors, with reference to the decision context in which the decision maker has to operate. The present study concerns the development of a multi-objective approach for the television scheduling design in which ratings and costs are the considered objectives to optimize, because these are the main factors influencing the decision process. In particular, an integer mathematical programming model is formulated and solved, considering as input data forecasted values of show-parts ratings and costs obtained by a suitable forecast engine. Finally, in order to show the employment of the proposed approach, a case study concerning the television scheduling optimization for an Italian TV channel is conducted with detailed practical considerations.

N2  - Abstract There has been a sudden increase in the usage of Learning Management Systems applications to support learner's learning process in higher education. Many studies in learning management system evaluation are implemented under complete information, while the real environment has uncertainty aspects. As these systems were described by development organizations with uncertainty terms such as vague, imprecise, ambiguity and inconsistent, that is why traditional evaluation methods may not be effective. This paper suggests neutrosophic logic as a better option to simulate human thinking than fuzzy logic because unlike fuzzy logic, it is able to handle indeterminacy of information which expresses the percentage of unknown parameters. As previous studies suggested neutrosophic decision maker and neutrosophic expert systems as future work in ecommerce and e-learning applications, this paper presents neutrosphic expert system for learning management systems evaluation. Information for building and validating the neutrosophic expert system is collected from five experts using surveys, and then analysis is done by using Fuzzytech 5.54d software. Finally, the comparison between fuzzy expert system and neutrosophic expert system results show that the neutrosophic logic is capable of representing uncertainty in human thinking for evaluating Learning Management Systems.

N2  - ABSTRACT This paper describes an approach that leverages computer simulation models and statistical experimental designs for exploration studies during the early conceptual design of a system. We apply the approach to a naval ship design problem and demonstrate how we can illuminate trade decisions among multiple design decisions and evaluation measures using a dynamic dashboard. After performing experimental designs on a collection of simulation models, we can fit statistical models that act as surrogates to these simulations. These surrogate models allow us to explore a wider variety of system alternatives rather than fixating on a narrow set of alternatives. The purpose of the approach is to simultaneously explore the operational and physical domains using statistical surrogate models in order to illuminate trade decisions between the system's operational effectiveness and physical design considerations.

N2  - Summary The flux switching permanent magnet (FSPM) motor is relatively a new topology of the permanent magnet (PM) motors, which both PM and armature winding are placed at the stator. This feature leads to more robust design, better heat dissipation, and a proper option for a wide range of industrial applications. The critical part of the development of FSPM motor is the design optimization of the structure to improve the electromagnetic performance of the motor. In this article, first to reduce the computation time and required memory of the optimization procedure, the multiobjective sensitivity analysis based on design of experiment is performed to specify the most effective parameters on the objectives. Then, the initial samples data of the optimization procedure is obtained by 2D finite element method (FEM) model of the FSPM motor, which is validated by the prototype of the motor. Furthermore, based on FEM results the multilayers perceptron artificial neural network for the approximation of relation between design variables and objectives is implemented. Finally, using the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, the optimization procedure of the FSPM motor is done. The accuracy of the presented optimization procedure is validated by a comparison of the initial prototype and final design of the motor.

N2  - Abstract Reflectarray antennas (RAs) have the ability to combine the advantages of both traditional parabolic reflector and phased array antennas without the need for feed network designs. Microstrip reflectarrays (MRAs) have the advantages of being small size, light weighted, easy to prototyped, high gain, low side-lobe level, and a predetermined radiation pattern. These can be achieved by precise calculation of reflection phase at each RA unit independently with a phase compensation proportional to the distance from the feed. The challenging problem is to have a fast and high accurate unit element to be used in multidimension, multiobjective design optimization. Herein, artificial intelligence algorithms (AIAs) have been used for prediction of reflection phase characterization of an X band MRA unit element with respect to the geometrical design parameters. Firstly, a nonuniform unit RA has been designed in 3D electromagnetic (EM) simulation tool for creating the training validation data sets. Then, the data sets are given to the different types of AIA regression models such as multilayer perceptron, symbolic regression, and convolutional neural network. From the results of the validation data set, it can be concluded that the proposed models have sufficient accuracy that can be used in a computationally efficient design optimization process of a large-scale RA design.

N2  - Summary Hydro power plants are one of the most cost-effective renewable technologies which have the potential to replace the conventional fuels. However, reliability of the plant varies with time due to irregularity in flow pattern of the river which depends on the pattern of climatic parameters like precipitation and evapo-transpiration. The reliability of the plant performance also varies with the efficiency of the power equipment and conveyance coefficient of penstock, both of which are time dependent. When reliability reduces, performance efficiency also gets degraded. That is why, monitoring of reliability in hydro power plants is essential and required to be conducted periodically. But at present, such activities are expensive due to the requirement of extensive surveys, data collection and performance audits of the equipment and structures involved in the power production. There is a lack of single indicator based real time monitoring processes which can be utilized to continuously regulate the reliability of the power plant. Such system can reduce both cost and time required for conducting reliability assessment procedures. That is why, in the present study, an objective and cognitive technique was utilized to develop a single index for real time monitoring of the reliability of a power plant. The results indicate that efficiency of generator, levelized cost of electricity and rate of selling per unit electricity are the most significant indicator which have the capability to represent reliability. A model developed for the present study by Polynomial Neural Network also ensures that regular monitoring of reliability of an HPP is possible.

N2  - Abstract Over the past few decades, groundwater has become an essential commodity owing to increased demand as a result of growing population, industrialization, urbanization and so on. The water supply situation is expected to become more severe in the future because of continued unsustainable water use and projected change in hydrometeorological parameters due to climate change. This study is based on the integrated approach of remote sensing, geographical information system and multicriteria decision-making techniques to determine the most important contributing factors that affect the groundwater resources and to delineate the groundwater potential zones. Ten thematic layers, namely, geomorphology, geology, soil, topographic elevation (digital elevation model), land use/land cover, drainage density, lineament density, proximity of surface water bodies, surface temperature and post-monsoon groundwater depth, were considered for the present study. These thematic layers were selected for groundwater prospecting based on the literature; discussion with the experts of the Central Ground Water Board, Government of India; field observations; geophysical investigation; and multivariate techniques. The thematic layers and their features were assigned suitable weights on Saaty's scale according to their relative significance for groundwater occurrence. The assigned weights of the layers and their features were normalized by using the analytic hierarchy process and eigenvector method. Finally, the selected thematic maps were integrated using a weighted linear combination method to create the final groundwater potential zone map. The final output map shows different zones of groundwater potential, namely, very good (16%), good (35%), moderate (28%) low (17%) and very low (2.1%). The groundwater potential zone map was finally validated using the discharge and groundwater depth data from 28 and 98 pumping wells, respectively, which showed good correlation.

N2  - Summary The predicted increase in mobile data traffic and in the number of mobile users poses challenges for network operators. Future mobile networks should support traffic volumes of several orders of magnitude larger than today. This may create situations in which the transmission capacity of the network is inadequate for the traffic demand. Intelligent and robust network management methods are thus needed to handle the upcoming changes. Because quite often the bottleneck lies in the wireless part of the network, it is essential to have methods in place to select appropriate wireless access points for the users or their applications. This can be performed either by a central entity or in a distributed manner in which the intelligence is placed in the user equipment or hybrid combinations of those. The selection criteria may vary from selfish optimization of a single user's quality of experience to global network load balancing and class-wise prioritization. This work explores the wireless access selection scheme from a system perspective in scenarios where users of different subscription classes are using progressive video streaming. Evaluation is carried out between a Q-learning based user-centric algorithm, a user class aware network-centric algorithm and a setting without handovers. Simulation results show that both user-centric and network-centric algorithms are able to improve the network performance and the quality of experience of the users. The gains of the network-centric algorithm are more evident during high congestion. In a lightly congested network, the distributed selfish optimization is also qualitatively a good solution for gold users. Copyright ? 2015?John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - ABSTRACT Many studies have evaluated wildlife passage effectiveness, but few have explored how accurately passage activity can be modeled. I created a habitat suitability index (HSI) model for American mink (Neovison vison) using a geographic information system with 17 wildlife passages located in Quebec, Canada as validation for the model. I addressed how well HSI modeling using constrained habitat data could determine mink passage activity and tested model sensitivity to different parameterizations. Uncertainty analysis revealed that the HSI model was sensitive to extreme changes in factor weights and scale. I used a generalized linear model to test how well the constrained HSI model explained the variability in passage activity (counts). For the HSI model (and all alternatives) the HSI scores were negatively associated with passage use. The predictive power of all models greatly improved after including aspects related to passage construction, with the pseudo-R2 increasing by 64?73%. These findings suggest that the constrained HSI models are a poor predicator of passage activity for mink, but wildlife passage characteristics are highly predictive. Transportation agencies would benefit from the ability to make informed planning decisions; however, greater care is required to determine passage suitability. The proper implementation of these tools requires knowledge of habitat preferences and how movement is influenced by the wildlife passages themselves. ? 2017 The Wildlife Society.

N2  - The objective of Aquarius project was to test the applicability of a food chain analysis on Atlantic salmon farmed in Norway to identify and monitor vulnerabilities and drivers of change for the identification of emerging risks. To this end, a comprehensive literature review was conducted complemented with expert views collected by on-line questionnaires and in-depth interviews. This review provided an overview of the various stages in the supply chain from farm to consumer and the identification of i) existing and emerging human and animal health hazards, ii) vulnerabilities, iii) control measures, iv) drivers of change, and v) related indicators. Next step in the study was to i) complement the list of vulnerabilities followed by a prioritisation using focus group discussions and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method and ii) link drivers of change acting upon the (prioritised) vulnerabilities and identification of associated indicators and data sources by means of a Delphi method. Based on the experiences obtained with the different methodologies during this project, the Aquarius team considers literature review, and a direct face-to-face interaction with experts (in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and FMEA in a workshop setting) as being most effective regarding output and effort. The comprehensive information collected formed the basis for the methodology to baseline key indicators of the selected vulnerabilities. The methodology proposed comprised a Bayesian Network (BN) that links data sources for indicators and drivers of change to the prioritised vulnerabilities and was demonstrated for salmon health. A Decision Support System (DSS) with such BN integrated was designed. The current BN and DSS could flag an increased exposure of known hazards that may occur due to changes in indicators but new hazards are not identified. The proposed methodology could be used instead to show trends in vulnerabilities, indicators, increased exposure of known hazards and for scenario studies.

N2  - Abstract Solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems can quickly become computationally challenging when applied to large networks generated from big data. Present-day first-rate Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solvers have parallelism built-in to take advantage of multicore architectures; but specialized network optimization algorithms that can often solve graph problems more efficiently than a general MIP solver are typically programmed serially. Thus, these network algorithm implementations do not take full advantage of modern multicore computer capabilities. Many parallel computing languages include a fork/join framework into their concurrency packages that allow for simple conversion of recursive serial algorithms to operate in parallel without having to use complicated low-level message-passing interfaces. Fork/join is particularly well suited to divide and conquer algorithms such as Non-Inferior Set Estimation (NISE) method for computing the supported Pareto front of a multi-objective optimization problem. This work develops a simple general parallel NISE (pNISE) implementation using the Java 7 concurrency tools, and then offers results from a specific implementation of solving a bi-objective shortest path problem. The results indicate that this method is capable of sizeable speed-ups on both small-scale personal computers as well as large-scale shared memory supercomputers. Finally, other network problems suitable to this method are discussed, including multi-objective variants of the minimum spanning tree problem, transportation problem, assignment problem, maximum flow problem, and the minimum-cost flow problem.

N2  - Summary Life cycle assessment (LCA)-based analyses of company value chains can inspire profound modifications to products? design, material procurement, manufacturing, energy/water use, distribution, use, and disposal. However, such modifications often create trade-offs, improving some aspects while worsening others. How can firms decide whether or not to carry out such modifications? Or prioritize between different options to choose the one delivering the most competitive advantage? Typically, firms? metrics fall into two groups: (1) product-level metrics across the life cycle, including up- and downstream of facilities (e.g., product carbon footprints); and (2) facility-level metrics (e.g., plants? annual energy cost). Neither is sufficient for firm-wide cost-benefit analyses of modifications that affect multiple products and value-chain stages. Whereas facility-level metrics do not capture up- and downstream effects?where often most cost and environmental impacts originate?life cycle methodologies are currently not mature enough to be applied at the scale of entire product portfolios. We present a pilot system of key performance indicators (KPIs) that evaluate 3,337 products across 211 brands and five countries of PepsiCo, Inc. KPIs are firm-wide, annual figures (environmental, operational, and financial) across the value chain (cradle to grave) and can be determined at any level (single product, brands, or regions). Uncertainty analysis is included. In addition to KPIs for base cases, the system characterizes KPI impacts for any considered modifications (what-if scenarios). In a detailed case study, we present background about how and why PepsiCo used the system to evaluate all aspects of a strategic value-chain modification. For 7 of the 211 brands, this resulted in avoiding an 8% increase in greenhouse gas emissions and a 7% to 10% increase in procurement costs. It also saved PepsiCo an estimated ?200 years full-time equivalent employee time (or alternatively ?US$30 million in LCA consultant fees) had the LCAs of the 3,337 SKUs been carried out by traditional methods. This cost efficiency of the KPI system enables considering environmental impacts with more-traditional business metrics side by side. As a result, environmental impacts can be considered on a routine basis as part of integrated strategy and business planning. We discuss implementation considerations of the KPI methodology and future improvements.

N2  - Summary Nowadays, a huge number of available Web services offer the same functionalities and a high quality of service, which makes the selection of suitable services a difficult task. In such situation, the services must be differentiated by additional criteria such as users' ratings. To meet this goal, recommendation techniques become a natural choice to cope with the challenging task of optimal service selection and to help consumers satisfy their needs and preferences. However, most existing models on service recommendation are static, whereas in the real world, the perception and popularity of Web services may continually change, and users' preferences and habits also shift frequently. Time is becoming an increasingly important factor in recommender systems, since time effects influence users' preferences to a large extent. In addition, quality-of-service performance of Web services is strongly linked to the service status and network environments, which are variable against time. Recently, a wide range of service recommendation approaches, dealing with the time dimension in user modeling and recommendation strategies, have been proposed. Thus, the purpose of this survey is to present a comprehensive study and analysis of the state-of-the-art on time-aware service recommendation. We identify the techniques used in recommender systems to provide the best services. Moreover, we present a classification of time-aware recommender systems based on the target recommendation time, the type of relationship between users, and the type of feedback. Besides, we present a comparison between time-aware recommendation approaches, and we discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, challenges and requirements of time-aware service recommendation as well as the future directions are identified according to the studied approaches.

N2  - Abstract The probabilistic linguistic term set is a flexible and efficient tool to represent the cognitive complex information of experts. It has attracted many scholars? attention since it was proposed. Information fusion over the cognitive complex information is a significant issue for decision-making problems. Over the past years, more than 40 aggregation operators have been proposed to fuse the probabilistic linguistic term sets. The aim of this paper is to survey the existing probabilistic linguistic aggregation operators from the perspectives of principles, definitions, classifications, and applications. To do so, first, we summarize the present normalization techniques and operations of probabilistic linguistic term sets. Afterward, this study classifies the existing probabilistic linguistic aggregation operators into 12 kinds. Then, the application areas of these probabilistic linguistic aggregation operators are outlined. Future research directions with interests are proposed to tackle present challenges.

N2  - Abstract In recent literature, prospective application of life cycle assessment (LCA) at low technology readiness levels (TRL) has gained immense interest for its potential to enable development of emerging technologies with improved environmental performances. However, limited data, uncertain functionality, scale up issues and uncertainties make it very challenging for the standard LCA guidelines to evaluate emerging technologies and requires methodological advances in the current LCA framework. In this paper, we review published literature to identify major methodological challenges and key research efforts to resolve these issues with a focus on recent developments in five major areas: cross-study comparability, data availability and quality, scale-up issues, uncertainty and uncertainty communication, and assessment time. We also provide a number of recommendations for future research to support the evaluation of emerging technologies at low technology readiness levels: (a) the development of a consistent framework and reporting methods for LCA of emerging technologies; (b) the integration of other tools with LCA, such as multicriteria decision analysis, risk analysis, technoeconomic analysis; and (c) the development of a data repository for emerging materials, processes, and technologies.

N2  - Abstract The ability for grocery retailers to have a single view of customers across all their grocery purchases remains elusive and has become increasingly important in recent years (especially in the United Kingdom) where competition has intensified, shopping habits and demographics have changed and price sensitivity has increased following the 2008 recession. Numerous studies have been conducted on understanding independent items that are frequently bought together (association rule mining/frequent itemsets) with several measures proposed to aggregate item support and rule confidence with varying levels of accuracy as these measures are highly context dependent. Uninorms were used as an alternative measure to aggregate support and confidence in analysing market basket data using the UK grocery retail sector as a case study. Experiments were conducted on consumer panel data with the aim of comparing the uninorm against three other popular measures (Jaccard, Cosine and Conviction). It was found that the uninorm outperformed other models on its adherence to the fundamental monotonicity property of support in market basket analysis (MBA). Future work will include the extension of this analysis to provide a generalised model for market basket analysis.

N2  - Abstract The Special Feature led by Sutherland, Dicks, Everard, and Geneletti (Methods Ecology and Evolution, 9, 7?9, 2018) sought to highlight the importance of ?qualitative methods? for conservation. The intention is welcome, and the collection makes many important contributions. Yet, the articles presented a limited perspective on the field, with a focus on objectivist and instrumental methods, omitting discussion of some broader philosophical and methodological considerations crucial to social science research. Consequently, the Special Feature risks narrowing the scope of social science research and, potentially, reducing its quality and usefulness. In this article, we seek to build on the strengths of the articles of the Special Feature by drawing in a discussion on social science research philosophy, methodology, and methods. We start with a brief discussion on the value of thinking about data as being qualitative (i.e., text, image, or numeric) or quantitative (i.e., numeric), not methods or research. Thinking about methods as qualitative can obscure many important aspects of research design by implying that ?qualitative methods? somehow embody a particular set of assumptions or principles. Researchers can bring similar, or very different, sets of assumptions to their research design, irrespective of whether they collect qualitative or quantitative data. We clarify broad concepts, including philosophy, methodology, and methods, explaining their role in social science research design. Doing so provides us with an opportunity to examine some of the terms used across the articles of the Special Feature (e.g., bias), revealing that they are used in ways that could be interpreted as being inconsistent with their use in a number of applications of social science. We provide worked examples of how social science research can be designed to collect qualitative data that not only understands decision-making processes, but also the unique social?ecological contexts in which it takes place. These examples demonstrate the importance of coherence between philosophy, methodology, and methods in research design, and the importance of reflexivity throughout the research process. We conclude with encouragement for conservation social scientists to explore a wider range of qualitative research approaches, providing guidance for the selection and application of social science methods for ecology and conservation.

N2  - Abstract Objectives To test the ability of a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to incorporate disparate data sources of varying quality along with clinical judgement in a benefit?risk assessment of six well-known pain-relief drugs. Methods Six over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics were evaluated against three favourable effects and eight unfavourable effects by seven experts who specialise in the relief of pain, two in a 2-day facilitated workshop whose input data and judgements were later peer-reviewed by five additional experts. Key findings Ibuprofen salts and solubilised emerged with the best benefit?risk profile, followed by naproxen, ibuprofen acid, diclofenac, paracetamol and aspirin. Conclusions Multicriteria decision analysis enabled participants to evaluate the OTC analgesics against a range of favourable and unfavourable effects in a group setting that enabled all issues to be openly aired and debated. The model was easily communicated and understood by the peer reviewers, so the model should be comprehensible to physicians, pharmacists and other health professionals.

N2  - Abstract In this paper, an optimal annual scheduling for power generation (i.e. rule curves and volume of water releases) in serial or parallel hydropower plants is developed. Multiobjective programming and weighted sum method are used to convert a multiobjective problem to a single objective one. Furthermore, to obtain viable alternatives under existing uncertainty, some random weight vectors in the whole weighting space are generated and for each weight vector an optimal solution is found using sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Then, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to select the best solution according to a given criterion, and determine the most preferred one. Besides, this method does not require choosing a priori preference for the objective function, thus making an ideal tool for handling complicated multiobjective models and easy to use with the aid of computer programs. Combination of multiobjective optimization and multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an integrated methodology that is capable of dealing with complex water management problems. Various scenarios for dry, median, and wet years are assumed based on stochastic flows from external sources (e.g. flooding rivers, unexpected rains, etc.) coming into each reservoir, and turbine power generation is obtained from hill diagrams provided by the manufacturer. The application of this methodology is illustrated in a case study for optimal scheduling of Karoon River Basin, where the decision support system and optimization routines are implemented in MATLAB. The total energy productions for 10 optimized solutions under dry, median, and wet scenarios (generated from forty-year historical inflow records) are calculated, and specific water consumption for each reservoir is obtained in different months. This can significantly help decision makers to have an optimal and more intelligent management over energy productions in hydropower plants and associated thermal power plants.

N2  - This article introduces new methods for ranking alternatives in multicriteria decision making situations. Each is based on the normative position that the strength of an alternative is inversely related to the number of alternatives that could prevent it from being chosen. The scores discriminate among elements of the Banks set (Banks, Soc Choice Welfare, 1985, 1, 295?306). The new scoring methods are compared to traditional scoring methods and related to the amount of intransitivity (specifically, the size of the top-cycle) of aggregated preference. The new scores are shown to measure important aspects of alternatives not captured by extant scoring methods and are illustrated in collective choice settings. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Recently, an increasing number of information retrieval studies have triggered a resurgence of interest in redefining the algorithmic estimation of relevance, which implies a shift from topical to multidimensional relevance assessment. A key underlying aspect that emerged when addressing this concept is the aggregation of the relevance assessments related to each of the considered dimensions. The most commonly adopted forms of aggregation are based on classical weighted means and linear combination schemes to address this issue. Although some initiatives were recently proposed, none was concerned with considering the inherent dependencies and interactions existing among the relevance criteria, as is the case in many real-life applications. In this article, we present a new fuzzy-based operator, called iAggregator, for multidimensional relevance aggregation. Its main originality, beyond its ability to model interactions between different relevance criteria, lies in its generalization of many classical aggregation functions. To validate our proposal, we apply our operator within a tweet search task. Experiments using a standard benchmark, namely, Text REtrieval Conference Microblog, emphasize the relevance of our contribution when compared with traditional aggregation schemes. In addition, it outperforms state-of-the-art aggregation operators such as the Scoring and the And prioritized operators as well as some representative learning-to-rank algorithms.

N2  - Abstract Objectives The aim of this study was to identify and weight the expert's relevant decision criteria with regard to drug treatment of functional dyspepsia and motility disorders. Attributes such as onset of action, reduction of symptoms and side effects were to be examined in order to test their relevance to healthcare decision makers. Moreover, the objective was to verify the extent to which the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and best?worst scaling (BWS) are suitable for use in context of an expert panel. Method In order to identify patient-relevant therapy characteristics, a literature search and qualitative interviews were conducted. On this basis, a questionnaire was developed using multi-criteria decision analysis. By means of the AHP and BWS, the study elicited the experts' priorities as regards the various aspects of treatments and gastrointestinal symptoms. The data collection from experts in gastroenterology was performed in real time within a group discussion using an item-response system. Results As a result of the interviews, seven characteristics and 10 symptoms were established. A total of N?=?20 experts took part in the survey. The following criteria were shown to be the most relevant in the AHP: ?reduction of abdominal cramps? (w: 0.302), ?reduction of epigastric pain? (w: 0.250) and ?time to onset of action? (w: 0.117). In the BWS, it was shown that the gastrointestinal symptoms ?vomiting? (sqrt(b/w): 0.118), ?abdominal cramps? (sqrt(b/w): 0.157) and ?epigastric pain? (sqrt(b/w): 0.356) were the most significant. Discussion The methods represent a suitable and scientifically transparent approach for the elicitation of experts' priorities. Using AHP, it was possible to ascertain the most important aspects of drug treatment and to correlate positive and negative characteristics. The BWS showed which gastrointestinal symptoms had the least and most pronounced negative impact on patient well-being from expert perspective. The item-response system served as a valuable instrument to collect data based on a group discussion. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract We introduce and solve two variants of a biobjective optimization model to reduce the negative impact of wind variability on the power system by strategically locating wind farms. The first model variant considers average changes in wind power over time; the second captures extreme fluctuations in wind power. A complementary set of wind sites is selected with the aim of minimizing both residual demand and the variability in residual demand. Because exact optimization is computationally intensive, we develop two heuristics?forward and backward greedy algorithms?to find approximate solutions. The results are compared with the exact optimization results for a well-selected subset of the data as well as to the results from selecting sites based on average wind alone. The two models are solved using demand data and potential wind sites for the Southwest Power Pool. Though both objectives can be improved by adding more sites, for a fixed number of sites, minimizing residual demand and variability in residual demand are competing objectives. We find an approximate efficient frontier to compare trade-offs between the two objectives. We also vary the parameter in the heuristic that controls how the two objectives are prioritized. For the case study, the backward greedy algorithm is more effective at reducing the wind power variability than the forward greedy algorithm. Furthermore, using the backward algorithm for the full dataset is more effective than solving the exact optimization on a subset of the data when the results are evaluated using the full dataset.

N2  - Abstract The quality of its players is one of the most significant features determining the failure or success of a sports team. The wide array of factors contributing to the performance of the players together with the inherent financial limitations of the clubs have transformed the selection of players into a complex problem. The current paper presents an integrated approach that combines multiple-criteria decision-making analysis and mathematical programming to support the decision maker through the building process of a soccer team. First, the fuzzy analytic network process is applied to evaluate the significance of the different performance criteria for each position in the field. The score attained by the different players in each potential position is computed using PROMETHEE II. A biobjective integer programming model has been designed to evaluate the transfer status of the players. Finally, data envelopment analysis is used to identify the most efficient Pareto solution determining the status of each player. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, the position in the field and transfer status of 60 players being considered by a real soccer team have been determined.

N2  - Summary An efficient task scheduling approach shows promising way to achieve better resource utilization in cloud computing. Various task scheduling approaches with optimization and decision-making techniques have been discussed up to now. These approaches ignored scheduling conflict among the similar tasks. The conflict often leads to miss the deadlines of the tasks. The work studies the implementation of the MCDM (multicriteria decision-making) techniques in backfilling algorithm to execute deadline-based tasks in cloud computing. In general, the tasks are selected as backfill tasks, whose role is to provide ideal resources to other tasks in the backfilling approach. The selection of the backfill task is challenging one, when there are similar tasks. It creates conflict in the scheduling. In cloud computing, the deadline-based tasks have multiple parameters such as arrival time, number of VMs (virtual machines), start time, duration of execution, and deadline. In this work, we present the deadline-based task scheduling algorithm as an MCDM problem and discuss the MCDM techniques: AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process), VIKOR (VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje), and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) to avoid similar task scheduling conflicts. We simulate the backfilling algorithm along with three MCDM mechanisms to avoid scheduling conflicts among the similar tasks. The synthetic workloads are considered to study the performance of the proposed scheduling algorithm. The mechanism suggests an efficient VM allocation and its utilization for deadline-based tasks in the cloud environment.

N2  - ABSTRACT Studying the factors influencing desertification progress of a region and its resulting zoning can be effective in helping to reduce the damage of this phenomenon. This study attempted to investigate the factors influencing desertification progress; hence, it proceeded to zone Sistan and Baluchestan Province using three analytic hierarchy processes, Expert Choice software and a geographic information system. First, factors affecting desertification progress were checked and they were then used to determine the most important aspects in order of priority as follows: climatic elements (temperature, evaporation, wind, precipitation and humidity), morphology (topography and slope) and human factors (land cover). Then, a zoning map of desertification-prone lands was prepared. The results showed that, in terms of hazard progress of these lands, there were five desertification hazard regions in Sistan and Baluchestan Province with an area of about 187 502 km2 and high hazard regions covering approximately 29.2% of the province were located in the north of the province. High hazard regions with an approximate area of 3.20% of the total area of the province were mostly located in Saravan, Khash, and the surrounding areas; medium hazard regions with an approximate area of 19.6% were in Iranshahr and the southeastern part of the province; low hazard regions with an area of about 18.2% were in the southern parts of the province; and very low hazard regions with an approximate area of 12.7% were in Nikshahr and the southern parts of the province.

N2  - Abstract Objective The American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism have developed new classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of Phase 2 of the development process was to achieve expert consensus on the clinical and laboratory variables that should contribute to the final criteria set. Methods Twenty-four expert RA clinicians (12 from Europe and 12 from North America) participated in Phase 2. A consensus-based decision analysis approach was used to identify factors (and their relative weights) that influence the probability of ?developing RA,? complemented by data from the Phase 1 study. Patient case scenarios were used to identify and reach consensus on factors important in determining the probability of RA development. Decision analytic software was used to derive the relative weights for each of the factors and their categories, using choice-based conjoint analysis. Results The expert panel agreed that the new classification criteria should be applied to individuals with undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis in whom at least 1 joint is deemed by an expert assessor to be swollen, indicating definite synovitis. In this clinical setting, they identified 4 additional criteria as being important: number of joints involved and site of involvement, serologic abnormality, acute-phase response, and duration of symptoms in the involved joints. These criteria were consistent with those identified in the Phase 1 data-driven approach. Conclusion The consensus-based, decision analysis approach used in Phase 2 complemented the Phase 1 efforts. The 4 criteria and their relative weights form the basis of the final criteria set.

N2  - Abstract The aim of this study is to propose a fuzzy decision-making model to rank manufacturing processes from the quality management perspective in the automotive industry. This paper proposes a model for improving quality management through the assessment and ranking of manufacturing subprocesses with respect to key performance indicators (KPIs). The developed model, supported with the fuzzy extended ELECTRE III, allows for the determination of subprocesses' rank. An illustrative example indicates that the proposed model could be very useful in everyday business operations as total quality management asset. The model can handle all uncertain and vague input data by applying the theory of fuzzy sets. The research also suggests different managerial implications because it provides an adequate tool for overall quality improvement. The number of treated KPIs is relatively high, so ELECTRE III method gives an advantage over other multicriteria analysis methods because it embraces less subjective thinking and demands slightly less experts' knowledge during the process of decision making and assessment.

N2  - Abstract The consensus-reaching process (CRP) to achieve higher unanimity and ensure common agreement before deriving a final decision has become an important procedure in group decision-making problems. The demand for high-quality decision results has motivated the development of large-scale group decision-making (LGDM). In such cases, the issue of minority opinion has gained awareness due to the related effects on enhancing consensus and decision quality. A minority opinion cannot exert an effect unless the majority attach importance to whether that opinion is supported or not. To reflect the effect of minority opinions on consensus, this paper establishes a LGDM framework with an objective and interactive-information-based feedback mechanism for the CRP. Given the natural forms of human expression, multi-granular linguistic information and a 2-tuple linguistic model are used. First, initial weights are objectively assigned to decision-makers (DMs) to weaken the impact of the majority. Subsequently, a non-support degree function is newly defined to reflect the extent to which other DMs dissent from a minority opinion. More importantly, feedback rules are constructed to make corresponding adjustments to the powers of discourse among all DMs in the attempt to reach consensus. Finally, the proposed three-phase LGDM framework is applied to new product development (NPD), and simulation experiments are conducted based on two algorithms to verify the framework's applicability and feasibility.

N2  - Abstract This paper provides an overview of regional science research in the Netherlands since the 1960s. It adopts a contextual thematic approach in identifying and interpreting regional science research topics, practices and methodologies, inspired by Toynbee's challenge and response concept. It argues that place-based, cultural and historical conditions in the Netherlands have prompted a pragmatic and evidence-based scientific approach, in which in particular an innovative quantitative orientation accompanied by a methodological heterogeneity has given Dutch regional science a high international profile. Over the past decades, numerous regional scientists in the country have contributed to this achievement, too many to be mentioned in this overview. This paper has its limitations and offers mainly thematic examples of original?often quantitative?research undertaken by various Dutch regional scientists, that make a difference compared to general approaches in Europe and world-wide. From our concise review we conclude that ? despite the small size of the country ? the challenge and creative response model of Dutch regional science has been rather successful.

N2  - Abstract This paper focuses on multi-attribute design problems in which several quantitative and/or qualitative attributes are simultaneously involved. Preference elicitation methods dealing with decision-makers' preferences are often employed to solve such problems. The present paper proposes a conceptual framework that considers preference elicitation as a process shaped by the interaction of different factors including the researcher, methodology, questionnaire and respondent in a given context, at the same time. The aim of the framework is to assist in choosing a decision support tool among various multi-attribute decision-making methods, as well as in evaluating and understanding preference elicitation results. To illustrate and exemplify the use of the framework, it is applied to a real-world case of end user preferences of mobile service platforms. We make use of two methods that are suitable for such a setting: analytic hierarchy process and conjoint analysis. Albeit with considerable discrepancies, the results show that both methods provide insightful information on the principle. Nonetheless, to a large degree, these methods perform differently in the case of non-complex tasks and unknowledgeable respondents, which the process view aids in evaluating and understanding.

It is oriented towards improving the robustness of the intervention and its results in an incremental definition of both the problem formulation and the model, in order to reduce the uncertainty that is not only associated with the model parameters but also with the model structure, and sometimes also with the problem formulation. The nature and results of this approach, which consider the interaction between an analyst and the actors of the decision system as the decision aiding core, are proposed in relation to some actual interventions.

N2  - Summary Multicarrier energy systems are increasingly used for a number of applications, among which the supply of electricity, heating, and cooling in buildings. The possibility of switching between different energy sources is a crucial advantage for the optimal fulfillment of the energy demand. The flexibility of these systems can benefit from the integration with smart grids, which have strong variations in time during their operation. The energy price is the parameter that is usually considered, but also the primary energy factor and the greenhouse gases emissions need to be accounted. This paper presents an application of an operational optimization method for a multicarrier energy system, based on real data?driven model and applied to different countries. The generation plant of a hospital is considered as case study, coping with multiple energy needs by relying on different conversion technologies. The optimal operation of the system shows a wide range of variability, depending on the chosen objective function, the hour of the day, the season, and the country. The results are affected mostly by the energy mix of the electricity supplied from the power grid, which has a direct influence on the primary energy consumption and the greenhouse gases emissions and an indirect influence on the electricity prices.

N2  - Abstract Effective groundwater monitoring networks are important, as systematic data collected at observation wells provide a crucial understanding of the dynamics of hydrogeological systems as well as the basis for many other applications. This study investigates the influence of six groundwater level monitoring network (GLMN) sampling designs (random, grid, spatial coverage, and geostatistical) with varying densities on the accuracy of spatially interpolated groundwater surfaces. To obtain spatially continuous prediction errors (in contrast to point cross-validation errors), we used nine potentiometric groundwater surfaces from three regional MODFLOW groundwater flow models with different resolutions as a priori references. To assess the suitability of frequently-used cross-validation error statistics (MAE, RMSE, RMSSE, ASE, and NSE), we compared them with the actual prediction errors (APE). Additionally, we defined upper and lower thresholds for an appropriate spatial density of monitoring wells. Below the lower threshold, the observation density appears insufficient, and additional wells lead to a significant improvement of the results. Above the upper threshold, additional wells lead to only minor and inefficient improvements. According to the APE, systematic sampling lead to the best results but is often not suited for GLMN due to its nonprogressive characteristic. Geostatistical and spatial coverage sampling are considerable alternatives, which are in contrast progressive and allow evenly spaced and, in the case of spatial coverage sampling, yet reproducible coverage with accurate results. We found that the global cross-validation error statistics are not suitable to compare the performance of different sampling designs, although they allow rough conclusions about the quality of the GLMN.

N2  - Abstract Complexity negatively impacts the process of continually improving performance management systems (PMSs). The extant PMS literature considers complexity to be a result of the external environment rather than a user response to that environment. However, this paper argues that organizations generally face internal complexity when adopting PMSs. Introducing PMSs into an organization can have varied effects in those organizations based on the complexity of an organization's associated members and its interactions. This study aims to understand the emergence of complexities while implementing and using PMSs in organizations. From the complexity theory perspective, four system properties (ontological, teleological, genetic and functional) are used to understand complexity in PMSs. The paper builds on a systematic literature review consisting of 76 papers and analyses them in the light of exploring sources of complexity when implementing and using PMSs. From the outset, complexity is understood to be a result of the conflict between existing organizational practices and mechanisms and the organizational controls associated with PMSs. The key findings abstracted six sources of complexity in this study: role, task and procedural types of complexity associated with the social dimension, and methodological, analytical and technological types of complexity associated with the technical dimension. The study findings contribute to the current discussion regarding why PMSs typically lag and are not responsive and resilient in emerging contexts. While understanding and exploring all organizational controls that moderate a PMS is useful, organizations should construct the necessary capabilities, depending on their context and adapt to the changes associated with PMSs.

N2  - Abstract Facility relocation has a long-term impact on business competitiveness in terms of cost efficiency, service level, and accessibility to marketplace. This paper investigates the impacts of relocating a company's logistics facility. Specifically, a case study of a logistics service provider for a bank, whose services include cash pick-up and deliveries, and ATM refill, is conducted. Some of the major logistics issues caused by the relocation of the company's distribution center are identified through process observation and in-depth interview. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is implemented to evaluate and rank the importance of the logistics issues according to the needs and requirements of the company's policy makers. Four criteria considered in the AHP include cost, responsiveness, reliability, and utilization. Results show that, from the company's perspective, the development of logistics key performance indices is given the highest priority, followed by improvement of internal process, vehicle routing, network design, and inventory management, respectively.

N2  - Abstract The number of people with dementia (PwD) is increasing dramatically. PwD exhibit impairments of reasoning, memory, and thought that require some form of self-management intervention to support the completion of everyday activities while maintaining a level of independence. To address this need, efforts have been directed to the development of assistive technology solutions, which may provide an opportunity to alleviate the burden faced by the PwD and their carers. Nevertheless, uptake of such solutions has been limited. It is therefore necessary to use classifiers to discriminate between adopters and nonadopters of these technologies in order to avoid cost overruns and potential negative effects on quality of life. As multiple classification algorithms have been developed, choosing the most suitable classifier has become a critical step in technology adoption. To select the most appropriate classifier, a set of criteria from various domains need to be taken into account by decision makers. In addition, it is crucial to define the most appropriate multicriteria decision-making approach for the modelling of technology adoption. Considering the above-mentioned aspects, this paper presents the integration of a five-phase methodology based on the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution to determine the most suitable classifier for supporting assistive technology adoption studies. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process is used to determine the relative weights of criteria and subcriteria under uncertainty and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution is applied to rank the classifier alternatives. A case study considering a mobile-based self-management and reminding solution for PwD is described to validate the proposed approach. The results revealed that the best classifier was k-nearest-neighbour with a closeness coefficient of 0.804, and the most important criterion when selecting classifiers is scalability. The paper also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm that should be addressed in future research.

N2  - Abstract Purpose In drug safety, there is a lack of guidance on how prioritization of safety issues should be performed. The aim of this literature review is to provide an overview of criteria used for signal prioritization and of the associated decision support frameworks. Methods A search strategy was constructed to identify relevant articles in Medline/Embase databases from the period from 1 January 1995 to 31 August 2015. The prioritization criteria were extracted and classified in relevant categories. Results From an initial set of 63 articles, 11 were retained for full review. The articles mentioned 48 criteria used in the prioritization process, with a median of six criteria per study [range: 1?16]. More than half of the criteria (63%), referred to strength of evidence while 19% related to public health impact, 14% to general public and media attention and 4% to novelty of the drug event association. Fifteen criteria were tested for predictive value with 11 showing positive results, most of them from the strength of evidence category. Six decision-making frameworks are presented, which incorporate criteria from various categories. Five of these frameworks were tested against expert decisions or by other means, but only in one database each and for a limited set of products. Conclusions There is a wide range of prioritization criteria described in the literature; however, few of them demonstrated predictive value. Many criteria with predictive value were related to strength of evidence category and to novelty. There were few attempts at integrating different criteria in decision support frameworks. Five of the frameworks were tested for validity and showed usefulness, while at least three are already in use for prioritization. Copyright ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - ABSTRACT Regulatory agencies often face a dilemma when regulating chemicals in consumer products?namely, that of making decisions in the face of multiple, and sometimes conflicting, lines of evidence. We present an integrative approach for dealing with uncertainty and multiple pieces of evidence in toxics regulation. The integrative risk analytic framework is grounded in the Dempster?Shafer (D?S) theory that allows the analyst to combine multiple pieces of evidence and judgments from independent sources of information. We apply the integrative approach to the comparative risk assessment of bisphenol-A (BPA)-based polycarbonate and the functionally equivalent alternative, Eastman Tritan copolyester (ETC). Our results show that according to cumulative empirical evidence, the estimated probability of toxicity of BPA is 0.034, whereas the toxicity probability for ETC is 0.097. However, when we combine extant evidence with strength of confidence in the source (or expert judgment), we are guided by a richer interval measure, (Bel(t), Pl(t)). With the D?S derived measure, we arrive at various intervals for BPA, with the low-range estimate at (0.034, 0.250), and (0.097,0.688) for ETC. These new measures allow a reasonable basis for comparison and a justifiable procedure for decision making that takes advantage of multiple sources of evidence. Through the application of D?S theory to toxicity risk assessment, we show how a multiplicity of scientific evidence can be converted into a unified risk estimate, and how this information can be effectively used for comparative assessments to select potentially less toxic alternative chemicals.

N2  - Abstract This paper analyses the factors impacting consumer environmental responsibility using a structural equation modeling approach. Consumer environmental responsibility is the intention of a person to act towards remediation of environmental problems not as an individual user with economic interests but as a responsible citizen having concerns about the social and environmental wellbeing of society. Therefore, awareness of environmental problems and knowledge of remedial alternatives will help individuals to pursue their chosen action and bolster a genuine desire to act and determine the measures for alleviation of environmental challenges. The four dimensions of an environmentally responsible consumer ? opinion and beliefs, willingness, awareness, and an ability to act ? are analysed. During the analysis, the dimension of ?ability to move? is found to be critical, because it has a direct influence on the capacity of the consumer to act. This research is intended to guide policy- and decision-makers of regulatory bodies in understanding consumer behavior towards improving environmental performance index. It also helps organizational managers to make their supply chains green, and competitive, which in turn improves brand image and overall organizational performance.

N2  - Abstract Human beings represent and process imperfect information in a natural way, whereas effective approaches are still being looked for in the area of soft computing. Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets and especially Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy relations are are tools that make it possible to model in an effective way imperfect information. In this paper, we discuss the transitivity problem of Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy relations. The transitivity property reflects the consistency of a preference relation. Therefore, transitivity is important from the point of view of real problems appearing, e.g., in group decision making, choice, and utility theories widely making use of the preference procedures. We study here in detail transitivity property of Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy relations and propose a new algorithm for generating weakly transitivity among the alternatives (options) considered. Next, making use of the new algorithm we propose a procedure of ranking of the alternatives in a group decision-making problem.

N2  - Abstract This article presents a discourse on the incorporation of organizational factors into probabilistic risk assessment (PRA)/probabilistic safety assessment (PSA), a topic of debate since the 1980s that has spurred discussions among industry, regulatory agencies, and the research community. The main contributions of this article include (1) identifying the four key open questions associated with this topic; (2) framing ongoing debates by considering differing perspectives around each question; (3) offering a categorical review of existing studies on this topic to justify the selection of each question and to analyze the challenges related to each perspective; and (4) highlighting the directions of research required to reach a final resolution for each question. The four key questions are: (I) How significant is the contribution of organizational factors to accidents and incidents? (II) How critical, with respect to improving risk assessment, is the explicit incorporation of organizational factors into PRA? (III) What theoretical bases are needed for explicit incorporation of organizational factors into PRA? (IV) What methodological bases are needed for the explicit incorporation of organizational factors into PRA? Questions I and II mainly analyze PRA literature from the nuclear domain. For Questions III and IV, a broader review and categorization is conducted of those existing cross-disciplinary studies that have evaluated the effects of organizational factors on safety (not solely PRA-based) to shed more light on future research needs.

N2  - Abstract Traditional multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) methods focus on weights calculation of sub-attributes and experts' preferences, but lack the discussion on the decision-makers' affective interaction, and its influence on the decision preference and group consistency. To address this problem, the present study proposed a new multilayer affective computing model based on ?personality?mood?emotion? pattern, under the multi-agent decision system framework. In addition, we introduced the group trending index and affection-preference incentive mechanism, which can help simulate MAGDM process and learn group experts' decision preferences. Further, we proposed a new multi-agent affective interactive MAGDM (MAAI-MAGDM) method, where we defined a novel group convergence index and an alternative decision entropy to explain the convergence process of decision and group consistency. Compared to the traditional MAGDM approaches, the proposed MAAI-MAGDM method fully considered the affective features of each expert, reduced the dependence on aggregation operators and weight analysis, alleviated the workload of group experts, and effectively reduced the complexity of decision-making calculation process. Finally, we verified that the proposed method can effectively assist the decision-making processes by employing two numerical cases.

N2  - Abstract In this paper, we initiate a new axiomatic definition of Pythagorean fuzzy distance measure, which is expressed by Pythagorean fuzzy number that will reduce the information loss and remain more original information. Then, the objective weights of various criteria are determined via grey system theory. Combining objective weights with subjective weights, we present the combined weights, which can reflect both the subjective considerations of the decision maker and the objective information. Meanwhile, a novel score function is proposed. Later, we present two algorithms to solve stochastic multicriteria decision making problem, which takes prospect preference and regret aversion of decision makers into consideration in the decision process. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of approach is demonstrated by a numerical example.

N2  - Abstract Because of the current shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources, it is necessary to plan for the installation of new infrastructure to meet the demand for clean energy. Traditional methods for determining wind turbine site suitability suffer from the selection of arbitrary criteria and model parameters by experts, which may lead to a degree of uncertainty in the models produced. An alternative empirically based methodology for building a wind turbine siting model for the state of Iowa is presented in the study. We employ ?ecological niche? principles traditionally utilized to model species allocation to develop a new multicriteria, spatially explicit framework for wind turbine placement. Using information on suitability conditions at existing turbine locations, we incorporate seven variables (wind speed, elevation, slope, land cover, distance of infrastructure and settlements, and population density) into two machine-learning algorithms [maximum entropy method (Maxent) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Prediction (GARP)] to model suitable areas for installation of wind turbines. The performance of this method is tested at the statewide level and a six-county region in western Iowa. Maxent and GARP identified areas in the Northwest and North Central regions of Iowa as the optimum location for new wind turbines. Information on variable contributions from Maxent illuminates the relative importance of environmental variables and its scale-dependent nature. It also allows validating existing assumptions about the relationship between variables and wind turbine suitability. The resultant models demonstrate high levels of accuracy and suggest that the presented approach is a possible methodology for developing wind turbine siting applications.

N2  - Policy Points: Scarce resources, especially in population health and public health practice, underlie the importance of strategic planning. Public health agencies? current planning and priority setting efforts are often narrow, at times opaque, and focused on single metrics such as cost-effectiveness. As demonstrated by SMART Vaccines, a decision support software system developed by the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Engineering, new approaches to strategic planning allow the formal incorporation of multiple stakeholder views and multicriteria decision making that surpass even those sophisticated cost-effectiveness analyses widely recommended and used for public health planning. Institutions of higher education can and should respond by building on modern strategic planning tools as they teach their students how to improve population health and public health practice. Context Strategic planning in population health and public health practice often uses single indicators of success or, when using multiple indicators, provides no mechanism for coherently combining the assessments. Cost-effectiveness analysis, the most complex strategic planning tool commonly applied in public health, uses only a single metric to evaluate programmatic choices, even though other factors often influence actual decisions. Methods Our work employed a multicriteria systems analysis approach?specifically, multiattribute utility theory?to assist in strategic planning and priority setting in a particular area of health care (vaccines), thereby moving beyond the traditional cost-effectiveness analysis approach. Findings (1) Multicriteria systems analysis provides more flexibility, transparency, and clarity in decision support for public health issues compared with cost-effectiveness analysis. (2) More sophisticated systems-level analyses will become increasingly important to public health as disease burdens increase and the resources to deal with them become scarcer. Conclusions The teaching of strategic planning in public health must be expanded in order to fill a void in the profession's planning capabilities. Public health training should actively incorporate model building, promote the interactive use of software tools, and explore planning approaches that transcend restrictive assumptions of cost-effectiveness analysis. The Strategic Multi-Attribute Ranking Tool for Vaccines (SMART Vaccines), which was recently developed by the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Engineering to help prioritize new vaccine development, is a working example of systems analysis as a basis for decision support.

N2  - Abstract The United States Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) plays a critical role in ensuring safe travel aboard United States (US) air carriers. Federal Air Marshall agents, who operate out of field offices throughout the US, are assigned to accompany flights in order to deter and respond to hostile acts. In an era of limited resources, the FAMS is interested in optimally locating its field offices and agents to minimize the overall risk to the US air transportation system. This represents a highly constrained and complex optimization problem that resists standard techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach that leverages the value-focused thinking to model risk and optimize risk mitigation. Our approach uses a novel two-stage approach to risk analysis that reduces the optimization burden and provides a solution to the FAMS.

N2  - Abstract Growing human pressure and potential change in precipitation pattern induced by climate change require a more efficient and sustainable use of water resources. Hydrological models can provide a fundamental contribution to this purpose, especially as increasing availability of meteorological data and forecast allows for more accurate runoff predictions. In this article, two models are presented for describing the flow formation process in a sub-alpine catchment: a distributed parameter, physically based model, and a lumped parameter, empirical model. The scope is to compare the two modelling approaches and to assess the impact of hydrometeorological information, either observations or forecast, on water resources management. This is carried out by simulating the real-time management of the regulated lake that drains the catchment, using the inflow predictions provided by the two models.

N2  - Abstract Objective To categorise and map, at high resolution, the risk of malaria incidence in the Pacific region, the main malaria-endemic region of Colombia. Methods The relationship between the environmental variables Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Normalized Difference Water Index, Topographic Wetness Index, precipitation and temperature with the observed Annual Parasitic Index was evaluated using a generalised linear model. An incidence risk map at a resolution of 1 km2 was constructed and projected to the entire endemic region. Associations of malaria risk categories with both presence records and co-occurrence of the three main malaria vectors were determined. Results A significant correlation was found for the incidence of malaria with precipitation and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (R2 = 0.98, P < 0.05), whereas there was no significant correlation with the remaining environmental and topographic variables. Moderate- to high-risk areas were located mainly in central Chocó Department along the San Juan and Atrato rivers and in areas west of the Cauca River and Pacific lowlands of the Andes Mountains. There was a statistically significant relationship for the presence of the two main vectors Anopheles darlingi and Anopheles nuneztovari with the high malaria risk category. Furthermore, malaria risk was directly proportional to the number of co-occurring vector species. Conclusions The map obtained provides useful information on the risk of malaria in particular places of the Colombian Pacific region. The data can be used by public entities to optimise the allocation of economic resources for vector control interventions and surveillance.

N2  - Abstract Design of microwave components is an inherently multiobjective task. Often, the objectives are at least partially conflicting and the designer has to work out a suitable compromise. In practice, generating the best possible trade-off designs requires multiobjective optimization, which is a computationally demanding task. If the structure of interest is evaluated through full-wave electromagnetic (EM) analysis, the employment of widely used population-based metaheuristics algorithms may become prohibitive in computational terms. This is a common situation for miniaturized components, where considerable cross-coupling effects make traditional representations (eg, network equivalents) grossly inaccurate. This article presents a framework for accelerated EM-driven multiobjective design of compact microwave devices. It adopts a recently reported nested kriging methodology to identify the parameter space region containing the Pareto front and to render a fast surrogate, subsequently used to find the first approximation of the Pareto set. The final trade-off designs are produced in a separate, surrogate-assisted refinement process. Our approach is demonstrated using a three-section impedance matching transformer designed for the best matching and the minimum footprint area. The Pareto set is generated at the cost of only a few hundred of high-fidelity EM simulations of the transformer circuit despite a large number of geometry parameters involved.

N2  - Environmental decision support systems (EDSSs) are attractive tools to cope with the complexity of environmental global challenges. Several thoughtful reviews have analyzed EDSSs to identify the key challenges and best practices for their development. One of the major criticisms is that a wide and generalized use of deployed EDSSs has not been observed. The paper briefly describes and compares four case studies of EDSSs applied to the water domain, where the key aspects involved in the initial conception and the use and transfer evolution that determine the final success or failure of these tools (i.e., market uptake) are identified. Those aspects that contribute to bridging the gap between the EDSS science and the EDSS market are highlighted in the manuscript. Experience suggests that the construction of a successful EDSS should focus significant efforts on crossing the death-valley toward a general use implementation by society (the market) rather than on development.

N2  - Currently, patient preference studies are not required to be included in marketing authorization applications to regulatory authorities, and the role and methodology for such studies have not been agreed upon. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) conducted a pilot study to gain experience on how the collection of individual preferences can inform the regulatory review. Using a short online questionnaire, ordinal statements regarding the desirability of different outcomes in the treatment of advanced cancer were elicited from 139 participants (98 regulators, 29 patient or carers, and 12 healthcare professionals). This was followed by face-to-face meetings to gather feedback and validate the individual responses. In this article we summarize the EMA pilot study and discuss the role of patient preference studies within the regulatory review. Based on the results, we conclude that our preference elicitation instrument was easy to implement and sufficiently precise to learn about the distribution of the participants' individual preferences.

N2  - Abstract Background The objectives of this study were to elicit the preferences of patients with multiple myeloma regarding the possible benefits and risks of cancer treatments and to illustrate how such data may be used to estimate patients? acceptance of new treatments. Patients and Methods Patients with multiple myeloma from the cancer charity Myeloma UK were invited to participate in an online survey based on multicriteria decision analysis and swing weighting to elicit individual stated preferences for the following attributes: (a) 1-year progression-free survival (PFS, ranging from 50% to 90%), (b) mild or moderate toxicity for 2 months or longer (ranging from 85% to 45%), and (c) severe or life-threatening toxicity (ranging from 80% to 20%). Results A total of 560 participants completed the survey. The average weight given to PFS was 0.54, followed by 0.32 for severe or life-threatening toxicity and 0.14 for mild or moderate chronic toxicity. Participants who ranked severe or life-threatening toxicity above mild or moderate chronic toxicity (56%) were more frequently younger, working, and looking after dependent family members and had more frequently experienced severe or life-threatening side effects. The amount of weight given to PFS did not depend on any of the collected covariates. The feasibility of using the collected preference data to estimate the patients? acceptance of specific multiple myeloma treatments was demonstrated in a subsequent decision analysis example. Conclusion Stated preference studies provide a systematic approach to gain knowledge about the distribution of preferences in the population and about what this implies for patients? acceptance of specific treatments. Implications for Practice This study demonstrated how quantitative preference statements from a large group of participants can be collected through an online survey and how such information may be used to explore the acceptability of specific treatments based on the attributes studied. Results from such studies have the potential to become an important new tool for gathering patient views and studying heterogeneity in preferences in a systematic way, along with other methods, such as focus groups and expert opinions.

N2  - Abstract Factors used in environmental remedial decision making concerning ecological risk are not well understood or necessarily consistent. Recent Records of Decision (RODs) for Army CERCLA sites were reviewed to select case studies where remedial management occurred in response to ecological risks. Thirty-four Army RODs were evaluated representing decisions promulgated between 1996 and 2004. Five were selected based on assessments that remedial actions were clearly linked to concern for ecological receptors. The Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) approach and the subsequent risk management process were reviewed for each site. The case studies demonstrated that the ERA findings, as well as critical management decisions regarding interpretation of identified ecological risks, were determinants of remedial action objectives. Decisions regarding the selection of remedial alternatives were based on a set of criteria prescribed by Superfund requirements and guidance. Remedial alternative evaluations require protection of human health and the environment, but protective conditions were determined using different methods at each site. Examining the remedial management process for the 5 case study sites revealed that uncertainty in the risk assessment and decisions regarding appropriate spatial scales for both risk assessment and remediation were important factors influencing remedial action decisions. The case reviews also revealed that levels of documentation were variable from site to site. In the future, more detailed documentation of decision criteria and the development of criteria that consider the resilience of the site will result in more technically defensible ecological risk management.

N2  - Summary The aim of this paper is to propose a comprehensive framework for simultaneously measuring the performance of sustainable service and manufacturing supply chain management. Application of the proposed approach also results in reduced uncertainty of the performance measurement process caused by qualitative criteria evaluation. The proposed approach consists of two main steps. First, the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method has been used to determine important criteria by avoiding low influences; and then a Mamdani fuzzy inference system model has been adopted and applied for performance evaluation of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). This model is employed in order to cope with the vagueness that exists in the SSCM performance investigation due to the vagueness intrinsic in the evaluation of criteria. In the proposed model, human reasoning has been modelled with fuzzy inference rules and has been set in the system, which is an advantage compared with those models in which fuzzy set theory and multicriteria decision-making models are integrated. The proposed approach has been implemented in the pipe and fitting industry in order to highlight its application in real life. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out to determine the influence of service and manufacturing criteria on SSCM performance. The findings reveal that sustainable manufacturing criteria compared with sustainable service criteria have more effect on the performance of SSCM.

N2  - Abstract Nowadays, fierce competition enforces supply chain planners to develop market-oriented production strategies. Customer order decoupling point (CODP) could increase the supply chain efficiency and responsiveness simultaneously. The right position of CODP in production industries will result in a pattern for trade-off between responsiveness and operational efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to address the positioning problem of a push-pull boundary in a fuzzy hesitant environment. To this end, a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making methodology of analytic network process (ANP) and VIKOR is proposed in a hesitant judgement environment to determine the position of CODP in a supply chain. Finally, CODP positioning in the apparel supply chain, as an industry-based example, is analysed to show the applicability of the proposed method.

N2  - ABSTRACT Selection of new geographies in which to expand is a key decision for businesses aspiring to go beyond the opportunities in the existing markets. The conventional approaches of market selection can only provide a set of systematic steps for problem solving without considering the relationships between the decision factors. Decision models based on statistical techniques are able to examine the relationship between decision factors but are unable to effectively assist decision makers in identifying the most promising market, particularly in terms of prioritizing across decision factors. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a commonly used approach for choosing alternatives by prioritizing across multiple decision factors. The typical AHP modelling requires knowledge of criteria and/or alternatives along with their relative weights, generally elicited from field experts. Quite often, firms encounter situations where decision makers are aware of only the overall objective and a set of earmarked geographies for setting up market locations while being relatively unaware of decision criteria and relative weights. This precludes using AHP to identify promising market locations. This paper conceptualizes a market selection decision model that integrates AHP with statistical modelling techniques to identify the attractive market locations for the purpose of expansion. The model first uses principal component analysis and multiple regression to determine significant decision criteria and their weights. Thereafter, it applies AHP to prioritize the market locations across the decision criteria. This integrative approach is illustrated for identifying the attractive locations in rural markets for a steel firm in India. The major advantage of this approach is that unlike the existing models, it works in situations when firms have not enough knowledge about factors for evaluating alternative market locations. Another key advantage of the proposed model is that of economizing resources for data collection on variables representing decision factors. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract Management of a primary health-care network (PHCN) is a difficult task in every country. A suitable monitoring system can provide useful information for PHCN management, especially given a large quantity of health-care data that is produced daily in the network. This paper proposes a methodology for structured development of monitoring systems and a PHCN resource allocation monitoring model based on this methodology. The purpose of the monitoring model is to improve the allocation of health-care resources. The proposed methodology is based on modules that are organized into a hierarchy, where each module monitors a particular aspect of the system. This methodology was used to design a PHCN monitoring model for Slovenia. Specific aspects of the Slovenian PHCN were taken into account such as varying needs of patients from different municipalities, existence of small municipalities having less than 1000 residents, the fact that many patients visit physicians in other municipalities, and that physicians may work at more than one location or organization. The main modules in the model are focused on the overall assessment of the PHCN, monitoring of patients visits to health-care providers (HCPs), physical accessibility of health services, segment of patients in municipalities who have not selected a personal physician, assessment of the availability of HCPs for patients, physicians working on more than one location, and available human resources in the PHCN. Most of the model's components are general and can be adapted for other national health-care systems. Copyright ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Water distribution system (WDS) design naturally involves a trade-off between the cost and reliability or robustness of a design. Traditionally, WDS reliability quantification schemes have employed graph theoretic techniques or probabilistic schemes such as Monte Carlo simulation. In recent decades there has been increased interest in the application of so-called reliability surrogate measures, such as flow entropy, the resilience index, and network resilience, because of their ease of use and dramatically reduced computational burden. In this paper, these surrogate measures (as well as a mixed reliability surrogate) are employed in the multiobjective evolutionary design of a set of WDS benchmarks from the literature. The resulting Pareto-optimal sets in cost-reliability space for each surrogate measure are analyzed in terms of their ability to handle demand uncertainty and pipe failure, and a regression analysis is conducted in order to determine whether the surrogate measures are correlated to stochastic reliability and failure reliability as expressed by demand satisfaction measures. It is found that the resilience index demonstrates the best performance under pure stochastic demand variation. However, it lags when compared to the network resilience and mixed reliability measures in terms of reliability under pipe failure conditions. These are recommended as the most practical reliability surrogate measures for use in general WDS design, since they also produce designs that minimize size discontinuities between adjacent pipes. Flow entropy performs relatively poorly in terms of correlation to both stochastic reliability and failure reliability.

N2  - Summary Number of cloud data centers which consists of hundreds of hosts has increased tremendously around the world due to increase in demands for cloud services. It is expected energy consumption of data centers will reach 139.8 billion Kwh by 2020. Many algorithms are proposed to reduce energy consumption as well as service level agreement violationby minimizing the number of active hosts. Current proposed algorithms do not consider data center architecture, the physical position of hosts, and energy consumption of numerous switches that are in data centers. In this paper, a novel hierarchical cloud resource management is proposed that not only minimizes the number of hosts but also aggregates virtual machines on a limited subset of data center racks and modules to minimize energy consumption. Experimental results with Cloudsim show that our proposed algorithm reduces energy consumption up to 26% and service level agreement violation up to 96%.

N2  - Abstract Optimisation problems in Healthcare have received considerable attention for more than three decades. More recently, however, with decreasing birth rates in nearly all of the developed countries and increasing average longevity globally, optimisation issues in Healthcare have become noticeably important and attract keen interest from the Operations Research community. Over the years, attention has gradually expanded from resource allocation and strategic planning to include operational issues such as resource scheduling and treatment planning. This paper surveys several applications of Operations Research in the domain of Healthcare. In particular, the paper reviews key contributions addressing contemporary optimisation issues in this area. It highlights current research activities, focusing on a variety of optimisation problems as well as solution techniques used for solving the optimisation problems.

N2  - Abstract The objective of the present study was to investigate the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique as an alternative to the ISO standard 11035 for the sensory characterization and consumer preference of coffee through External Preference Mapping (PREFMAP). The methodological context consisted in the generation of the sensory vocabulary applying the techniques ISO standard 11035 using a trained panel and AHP using an expert panel. PREFMAP was then carried out to explain the preference of coffee consumers according to the vocabularies generated. The results showed that the sensory vocabulary using AHP was similar to that obtained with ISO standard 11035 and the judgments of the panel of experts were consistent. The PREFMAP'S explained in a similar way the preference of coffee consumers. The use of the AHP technique is a new, reliable, and easy-to-execute alternative for the selection of sensory vocabulary for characterization and explanation of consumer preference. Practical Applications The Analytic Hierarchy Process technique is a reliable alternative for the selection of sensory attributes. The attributes are evaluated by paired comparison and, by mathematical procedure, the weight (W) of each attribute and sensory dimension is obtained. Consistency indicators are also included to support and validate panel judgments. This new proposal can be easily implemented at an industrial and academic level for the development of different sensometric investigations that require characterizing and analyzing the preference of consumers of different foods.

N2  - Abstract The objective of this manuscript is to present some aggregation operators for aggregating the different complex intuitionistic fuzzy (CIF) sets by considering the dependency between the pairs of its membership degrees. In the existing studies of fuzzy and its extensions, the uncertainties present in the data are handled with the help of degrees of membership that are the subset of real numbers, which may lose some useful information and hence consequently affect the decision results. A modification to these, complex intuitionistic fuzzy set handles the uncertainties with the degrees whose ranges are extended from real subset to the complex subset with unit disc and hence handle the two-dimensional information in a single set. Thus, motivated by this, we developed some new power aggregation operators, namely, CIF power averaging, CIF weighted power averaging, CIF ordered weighted power averaging, CIF power geometric, CIF weighted power geometric, and CIF ordered weighted power geometric. Also, some of the desirable properties of these are investigated. Further, based on these operators, a multicriteria decision-making approach is presented under the CIF set environment. An illustrative example related to the selection of the best alternative(s) is considered to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach and is validated it by comparing their results with the several existing approaches results.

N2  - Summary The efficient execution of parallel programs with respect to execution time and energy consumption is a major concern, and often, scheduling methods are used to achieve a good performance. In this article, we consider the problem of scheduling a set of independent tasks on a parallel system with homogeneous execution units providing frequency scaling. The set of tasks has the property that the tasks exhibit a task-specific inhomogeneous and non-linear behavior of their specific time-energy relation. In addition, it is assumed that execution time and energy consumption behave in a non-linear manner with respect to frequency scaling. For the assignment of these tasks to execution units, we propose a scheduling selection process combining scheduling algorithms, which determine a task assignment, with a subsequent selection of frequency scaling, which we call schedule execution modes. This process builds a rich set of alternative schedule execution modes from which efficient (or Pareto-optimal) schedule execution modes can be selected. Experiments are done for the SPEC CPU benchmarks. Experimental results illustrate that the enriched scheduling process leads to task assignments resulting in an efficient execution on DVFS processors.

N2  - Six Sigma methodology for process improvement is being used by industries to improve customer satisfaction, business results or both. The success of Six Sigma implementation can be measured by evaluating the effectiveness of the completed projects. The other objective of project effectiveness measurement scheme is to keep the team focused and motivated. A good measurement system should be able to measure and compare projects of various types and need, including benefits from the projects. The project effectiveness measurement scheme should include success factors like project selection, involvement of management, results achieved, conduct of the project and monitoring and review of the project. A Six Sigma project effectiveness evaluation system is generally based on the perception of people that can result in unreliable measurement. To overcome this deficiency, we used a fuzzy approach based on linguistic variables and fuzzy numbers for measuring the project effectiveness in this study by using the perception of management. Two methods for measuring effectiveness of selected sample projects are suggested. The outcome from this research would be helpful for the practicing industries to use this methodology for an unbiased evaluation of completed projects. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract The aim of this paper is to highlight the role of the Decision Support System within the field of multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA). The MCDA tools have been incorporated into systems to create Multi-Criteria Decision Support Systems (MCDSSs). In our literature review, we noticed that more than 100 papers have been written over a 20-year period in which MCDSS was used as a decision-making tool. The present paper describes some real applications of MCDSS in different fields, harmoniously combined with decision-making methods such as analytic hierarchy process, Utility Additive, and Goal Programming. The present study proposes an integrative MCDSS evaluation through guidance on the tools most useful for a specific user with a particular decision problem. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Summary Recommendations based on offline data processing has attracted increasing attention from both research communities and IT industries. The recommendation techniques could be used to explore huge volumes of data, identify the items that users probably like, translate the research results into real-world applications and so on. This paper surveys the recent progress in the research of recommendations based on offline data processing, with emphasis on new techniques (such as temporal recommendation, graph-based recommendation and trust-based recommendation), new features (such as serendipitous recommendation) and new research issues (such as tag recommendation and group recommendation). We also provide an extensive review of evaluation measurements, benchmark data sets and available open source tools. Finally, we outline some existing challenges for future research.

N2  - Abstract We present the development and application of a computational molecular de novo design method for obtaining bioactive compounds with desired on- and off-target binding. The approach translates the nature-inspired concept of ant colony optimization to combinatorial building block selection. By relying on publicly available structure?activity data, we developed a predictive quantitative polypharmacology model for 640 human drug targets. By taking reductive amination as an example of a privileged reaction, we obtained novel subtype-selective and multitarget-modulating dopamine D4 antagonists, as well as ligands selective for the sigma-1 receptor with accurately predicted affinities. The nanomolar potencies of the hits obtained, their high ligand efficiencies, and an overall success rate of 90?% demonstrate that this ligand-based computer-aided molecular design method may guide target-focused combinatorial chemistry.

N2  - Abstract In this paper, development of robust and reliable chaotropic chromatography method for the determination of aripiprazole and its impurities, following Analytical Quality by Design principles is presented. The efficient baseline separation and accurate determination of aripiprazole and its four impurities from tablets were set as Analytical Target Profile. In line with it, the influence of Critical Method Parameters (acetonitrile content, concentration of perchloric acid in water phase, and column temperature) on predefined Critical Method Attributes (separation of the critical pair of peaks, retention of the first and last eluting peak) was investigated with aid of the Central Composite Design. Further on Design Space, where Critical Method Parameters meet predefined acceptance limits with a high level of probability (π ≥ 85%), was computed as a result of performed Monte Carlo simulations. A normal operating conditions corresponding to 34% of acetonitrile, 66% of 42.5 mM perchloric acid, and column temperature at 35°C were selected from created Design Space. Robustness testing of the quantitative performances of the developed method was conducted combining Plackett?Burman design with alias matrix approach. Through the additional validation testing, reliability of the developed method for the use in the routine practice was completely confirmed.

N2  - Abstract The efficacies of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are well documented in decreasing the apnoea?hypopnoea index in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. To guarantee these efficacies, CPAP manufacturers must thoroughly test these devices to ensure the flow of oxygenated air to the patient at various temperatures during a prescribed time frame. The calculation of the percent oxygen in a ?bimixture? of gas can be done by measuring the travel time of a sound wave through the gas, and the travel time is proportional to the density of the air. We utilized existing multisensor tubes that were developed to collect and measure oxygen flow, diffusion, speed, temperature, and time metrics. Then these metrics were analysed using a Markov fuzzy, statistical, artificial neural network, nearest-neighbour predictive approach to determine the interactions between these variables. An improved Kalman filter method was employed to reduce noise, increase viscosity, and obtain correct data from the CPAP system.

N2  - Summary The adoption of infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a reality for academic, industrial, and governmental institutions. Cloud tenants request dynamically provisioned virtual infrastructures (VIs) tailored to their application requirements, detailing not only the virtual compute/storage resources but also the network components, topology, and services. The creation of a large number of cloud providers came along with the widespread use of VIs. The selection of an appropriate provider is a challenging task due to the diversity of the IaaS market and formally is a multicriteria analysis (NP-hard). Notwithstanding the provider selection complexity, the mobility of VI-hosted applications is limited due to the optimization anchors introduced by providers. Although the existing IaaS cloud brokers can indicate a hosting provider, they lack on conceptual and technical skills to migrate a VI and all its internal components between providers. This work enhances the state-of-the-art on IaaS cloud brokerage by proposing virtual infrastructure multicriteria allocation and migration?based broker (VIMAM), which performs a multicriteria analysis of providers and VI migration. VIMAM is driven by an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to select an IaaS provider, offering a set of predefined weighting schemas to represent distinct tenant perspectives. Moreover, to migrate a VI, VIMAM takes into account the virtual machines, containers, switches, and other topology elements. In addition to discussing the AHP ranking weights and frequency of providers selection, the experimental analysis details the implementation of an OpenStack and Docker?based prototype for VI migration.

N2  - The necessity of dealing with uncertainty in real world problems has been a long-term research challenge that has originated different methodologies and theories. Fuzzy sets along with their extensions, such as type-2 fuzzy sets, interval-valued fuzzy sets, and Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets, have provided a wide range of tools that are able to deal with uncertainty in different types of problems. Recently, a new extension of fuzzy sets so-called hesitant fuzzy sets has been introduced to deal with hesitant situations, which were not well managed by the previous tools. Hesitant fuzzy sets have attracted very quickly the attention of many researchers that have proposed diverse extensions, several types of operators to compute with such types of information, and eventually some applications have been developed. Because of such a growth, this paper presents an overview on hesitant fuzzy sets with the aim of providing a clear perspective on the different concepts, tools and trends related to this extension of fuzzy sets.

N2  - Abstract The evolving requirements of 5G communication business cases around vertical markets in addition to rich content multimedia cloud applications call for advances in enabling technologies and standardization to realize tailor-made end-to-end network services, an approach commonly referred to as network slicing. Different mappings between infrastructure capabilities and custom service requirements produce an overload of information that a network service provider must handle to rationalize possible slicing alternatives for a given business case. This article proposes a methodology exploring algorithms from multicriteria analysis (MCA) to digest a set of slicing criteria advantage points into a coherent set of slicing preferences. Through extensive experimental analysis, we reasoning about observed patterns in the slicing alternatives and discuss the utility of the proposed MCA process for the definition of classes of slices, slicing abstractions views, and recovery/scalability analysis. Altogether, the MCA methodology proposed in this article sheds light into candidate mechanisms to tackle the pandora behind the yet-to-be-understood issues and unanticipated trade-offs of alternative network slicing approaches. Contributions of this article include providing a prominent outlook towards different dimensioning angles of network slicing, scoping its criteria design, timing, and the quality of the criteria information.

N2  - Abstract This paper presents a novel Multiple Criteria Decision Making methodology for assessing and prioritizing medical tourism destinations under uncertainty. A systematic evaluation and assessment approach is proposed by incorporating analytic hierarchy process and multi-attributive border approximation area comparison methods in the rough environment. Rough number is used to aggregate individual judgements of decision makers and express their true perception to handle vagueness without any prior information. Rough analytic hierarchy process analyses the relative importance of criteria based on their preferences given by experts, whereas rough multi-attributive border approximation area comparison evaluates the alternative sites based on the criteria weights. A case study of prioritizing different sites (cities) in India for medical tourism services is shown to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. Among different criteria ?quality of infrastructure of healthcare institutions? is observed to be the most important criteria in our analysis, followed by ?supply of skilled human resources and new job creations? and ?Chennai? is found to be the best medical tourism site in India. Finally, a comparative analysis and validity testing of the proposed method are elaborated, and the methodology provides a standard for select medical tourism sites on the basis of different criteria.

N2  - Abstract Battery module safety is a major concern for the commercial success of electric vehicles (EVs). Concurrently, it is also important to have a mechanically sound and ergonomically fit battery pack design. To solve this problem, a hybrid multi-output-predictive modelling based NSGA II approach is proposed. In this approach, the multiple predictive modelling methods (linear regression, regression with AdaBoost, decision tree regression and multi-layer perceptron [MLP]) are applied to predict the deformation, natural frequency and mass of battery pack enclosure. By performing the comparative analysis of these methods, the decision tree regression model was selected for deformation, MLP with tanh function for frequency and MLP with ReLU function for mass. Further, these selected models were optimized using NSGA II which resulted in optimum combination of input variables for achieving the maximum deformation (0.0019?m), minimum natural frequency (91.60?Hz), and mass (12.41?kg) simultaneously.

N2  - Summary Experts believe that the Internet of Things (IoT) is a new revolution in technology and has brought many advantages for our society. However, there are serious challenges in terms of information security and privacy protection. Smart objects usually do not have malware detection due to resource limitations and their intrusion detection work on a particular network. Low computation power, low bandwidth, low battery, storage, and memory contribute to a resource-constrained effect on information security and privacy protection in the domain of IoT. The capacity of fog and cloud computing such as efficient computing, data access, network and storage, supporting mobility, location awareness, heterogeneity, scalability, and low latency in secure communication positively influence information security and privacy protection in IoT. This study illustrates the positive effect of fog and cloud computing on the security of IoT systems and presents a decision-making model based on the object's characteristics such as computational power, storage, memory, energy consumption, bandwidth, packet delivery, hop-count, etc. This helps an IoT system choose the best nodes for creating the fog that we need in the IoT system. Our experiment shows that the proposed approach has less computational, communicational cost, and more productivity in compare with the situation that we choose the smart objects randomly to create a fog.

N2  - Various technological methods are available for industrial wastewater treatment; from conventional to advanced treatment processes. Hence, it is a difficult task to select the most appropriate technology to treat industrial wastewater at a particular location. Many factors are involved in the decision-making process, including capital, operation, and maintenance costs, as well as land requirement. The present work reports the results of the application of multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) tool to industrial wastewater treatment plants operated under a hybrid aerobic/anaerobic biological process. At the first step, nine industrial wastewater treatment plants were evaluated and ranked by eight criteria using the Vikor method. Among the selected criteria, land requirements, energy consumption, and excess sludge production had the most pronounced effect on the decision-making process. The results also indicated that the integration of upflow anaerobic fixed bed with intergraded fixed-film activated sludge process could be used as the most appropriate treatment technology with a Vikor index of one. The result can provide wastewater treatment professionals and water agencies with an effective tool to choose the most appropriate hybrid process for industrial wastewater treatment plants. ? 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38:e13146, 2019

N2  - Abstract Pharmaceutical supply chains (PSCs) are responsible for guaranteeing that the right people receive the right medication at the right time and in the right conditions. These responsibilities make PSC very complex and subsequently increase their vulnerability and disturbance probability. Resilience engineering (RE) can enable supply chain managers to cope with disruptions and to help them maintain their efficient performance. This study proposes a unique RE framework for performance optimization of the pharmaceutical sector in a veterinary organization. A standard questionnaire was used to collect the required data. Next, data envelopment analysis (DEA) and fuzzy data envelopment analysis (FDEA) approaches were employed to formulate the problem. Sensitivity analysis was performed based on the most appropriate model of DEA and FDEA. The results showed that redundancy was the most effective factor in enhancing efficiency in PSCs in the veterinary organization. This is one of the first studies that investigate the influence of resilience indicators on PSC through DEA/FDEA and statistical methods.

N2  - The paper evaluates the levels of smartphone addiction among students using statistical and fuzzy analysis approaches. By using Smartphone Addiction Test (SAT) scores, the data were treated using fuzzy operators, and the relationships were analyzed by applying the statistical techniques. The respondent's addiction level scores were converted into a fuzzy environment through the triangular approach, and demographic characteristics of the respondents were compared to levels of smartphone addiction. The percentage of respondents with mild and moderate levels of addiction to smartphones was found to be high in the study. Gender, age groups, and years of usage were also associated with addiction to smartphones. However, the level of smartphone addiction was not much different based on whether the students are staying with parents or away from their parents. Among the dimensions measuring smartphone addiction, ?lack of control? was ranked first. The dimension, ?excessive use,? was found to be the second-highest influencer of smartphone addiction level. Respondents, to no small extent, were students pursuing undergraduate and graduate programs. Adolescents and other demographic groups can be considered for future studies. Future studies can also focus on using other fuzzy approaches to evaluate the data on smartphone addiction. The study offers prioritized dimensions to be focused on containing the levels of addiction among individuals. Moreover, the ranking of items helps in guiding individuals to look into the problem areas and take the appropriate actions. Measurement of levels of smartphone addiction using a novel hybrid combination of statistical approach and triangular fuzzy approach was carried out in the study. The critical dimensions and items showing the influence on smartphone addiction were ranked.

N2  - Summary This article proposes a random-forest based A2Cloud framework to match scientific applications with Cloud providers and their instances for high performance. The framework leverages four engines for this task: PERF engine, Cloud trace engine, A2Cloud-ext engine, and the random forest classifier (RFC) engine. The PERF engine profiles the application to obtain performance characteristics, including the number of single-precision (SP) floating-point operations (FLOPs), double-precision (DP) FLOPs, x87 operations, memory accesses, and disk accesses. The Cloud trace engine obtains the corresponding performance characteristics of the selected Cloud instances including: SP floating point operations per second (FLOPS), DP FLOPS, x87 operations per second, memory bandwidth, and disk bandwidth. The A2Cloud-ext engine uses the application and Cloud instance characteristics to generate objective scores that represent the application-to-Cloud match. The RFC engine uses these objective scores to generate two types of random forests to assist users with rapid analysis: application-specific random forests (ARF) and application-class based random forests. The ARF consider only the input application's characteristics to generate a random forest and provide numerical ratings to the selected Cloud instances. To generate the application-class based random forests, the RFC engine downloads the application profiles and scores of previously tested applications that perform similar to the input application. Using these data, the RFC engine creates a random forest for instance recommendation. We exhaustively test this framework using eight real-world applications across 12 instances from different Cloud providers. Our tests show significant statistical agreement between the instance ratings given by the framework and the ratings obtained via actual Cloud executions.

N2  - Abstract A major challenge in the assessment of medicines, treatment options, etc., is to establish a framework for the comparison of risks and benefits of many different types and magnitudes, a framework that at the same time allows a clear distinction between the roles played by the statistical analyses of data and by judgements based on personal experience and expertise. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate how clinical data can be weighted, scored and presented by the use of an eight-step data-driven benefit?risk assessment method, where two genetic profiles are compared. Our aim was to present a comprehensive approach that is simple to apply, allows direct comparison of different types of risks and benefits, quantifies the clinical relevance of data and is tailored for the comparison of different options. We analysed a cohort of 302 patients with colorectal cancer treated with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Endpoints were cure rate, survival rate, time-to-death (TTD), time-to-relapse (TTR) and main adverse drug reactions. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was used to identify genetic interaction profiles associated with outcome. We have been able to demonstrate that a specific MDR-derived combination (the MDR-1 group) of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and thymidylate synthase polymorphisms is associated with increased and clinically significant difference for cure and survival rates, TTD and probably also for TTR, which are seen as the most important endpoints. An inferior profile was observed for severe myocardial ischaemia. A probably inferior profile was seen for severe arthralgia/myalgia and severe infections. A clear superior profile was seen for severe mucositis/stomatitis. The proposed approach offers comprehensive, data-driven assessment that can facilitate decision processes, for example, in a clinical setting. It employs descriptive statistical methods to highlight the clinically relevant differences between options.

N2  - Abstract The computer-assisted generation of new chemical entities (NCEs) has matured into solid technology supporting early drug discovery. Both ligand- and receptor-based methods are increasingly used for designing small lead- and druglike molecules with anticipated multi-target activities. Advanced ?polypharmacology? prediction tools are essential pillars of these endeavors. In addition, it has been realized that iterative design-synthesis-test cycles facilitate the rapid identification of NCEs with the desired activity profile. Lab-on-a-chip platforms integrating synthesis, analytics and bioactivity determination and controlled by adaptive, chemistry-driven de novo design software will play an important role for future drug discovery.

N2  - Abstract The role of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in the public sector is relatively new. Prior research on private sector CFOs identified that CFOs tend to focus on either financial or strategic issues. In this study, we examined if these same tendencies exist within the public sector. Using the Department of National Defence as a case study, we asked Comptrollers to compare a set of 8 roles to determine if a bias towards financial or strategic roles exists. We found that some bias exists within National Defence; however, we also found most recognize that you cannot focus exclusively on either role.

N2  - Abstract The United States' National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to use environmental impact assessment tools to aggregate scientific information, garner stakeholder input, and weigh alternatives for infrastructure siting and operations decisions.Thus, NEPA plays a sweeping role in federal infrastructure provisioning. Using a comprehensive dataset of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) prepared under NEPA from 2013 to 2019, we use natural language processing to identify geographic locations and artificial neural networks to classify discussed environmental impacts. We then describe geographic, temporal, and environmental trends in federal infrastructure provisioning. Finally, we use Bayesian hierarchical regression to assess how socio-economic and demographic covariates shape county-level EIS counts. Numerous federal agencies are involved in EIS production, but three agencies author the majority of EISs. Total EISs issued annually have declined since the early 2000s. EISs are more frequent in urban coastal counties, but do not show clear distributive trends by income or race.

N2  - Abstract In this paper, we present two neural-network-based techniques: an adaptive evolutionary multilayer perceptron (aDEMLP) and an adaptive evolutionary wavelet neural network (aDEWNN). The two models are applied to the task of forecasting and trading the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), the iShares NYSE Composite Index Fund (NYC) and the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We benchmark their performance against two traditional MLP and WNN architectures, a smooth transition autoregressive model (STAR), a moving average convergence/divergence model (MACD) and a random walk model. We show that the proposed architectures present superior forecasting and trading performance compared to the benchmarks and are free from the limitations of the traditional neural networks such as the data-snooping bias and the time-consuming and biased processes involved in optimizing their parameters.

N2  - Summary The aim of the current research is to develop a more accurate Web service selection approach that can deal with value constraints on QoS criteria in the user request. The purpose is to be able to promote services even when all the value constraints are not satisfied and hence rank them according to their closeness to meet the latter. For this effect, we use MCDM (Multi Criteria Decision making) methods together with suitable normalization techniques at different stages of the process. First of all, we consider an extension of the AHP method to compute and normalize the weights associated with the QoS criteria considered in the Web service selection. Second, we introduce a more consistent normalization technique, called OMRI, to normalize data according to value constraints. Third, we propose to extend different ranking MCDM methods to the OMRI normalization so that it becomes possible for them to cope with value constraints. The considered methods are SAW, TOPSIS, VIKOR, and WPM. To compare the accuracy of the extended ranking methods, we use the Borda compromise solution together with different similarity ratios. To validate the solution, several experiments have been conducted on a real dataset as well as on an artificial one.

N2  - Abstract With the big-data and mobile Internet era coming, sensitive information (SI) in various applications plays a key role; even more, they can be an important part of the authentication between clients and servers. However, how to measure security or sensitivity degrees of SI is an open issue. Furthermore, no effective method can detect covert channel of SI thieves in Advanced Persistent Threat attacks. To deal with these problems, we propose a new design, called software-defined networking (SDN)-based SI Protection, in which sensitivity degree can be measured by using Analytic Hierarchy Process and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution, and SI covert channel can be detected based on OpenFlow in SDN. To our best knowledge, it is the first defined sensitivity degree for SI and novel flow-table design in SI data flow switch. Most significantly, our proposal can apply integrated semantics of leakage points and accident attacks into security analysis and switch protocol in Operating System or network. To verify our proposal, experimental tests are performed in social network platforms, field test results have demonstrated that this proposal can capture security level for SI as expected, detect any kinds of potential leakage points in data lifetime, describe fine-grained semantics of accidental attacks, and detect illegal data flow of SI in network layer.

N2  - Summary In recent years, the usage of smart mobile applications to facilitate day-to-day activities in various domains for enhancing the quality of human life has increased widely. With rapid developments of smart mobile applications, the edge computing paradigm has emerged as a distributed computing solution to support serving these applications closer to mobile devices. Since the submitted workloads to the smart mobile applications changes over the time, decision making about offloading and edge server provisioning to handle the dynamic workloads of mobile applications is one of the challenging issues into the resource management scope. In this work, we utilized learning automata as a decision-maker to offload the incoming dynamic workloads into the edge or cloud servers. In addition, we propose an edge server provisioning approach using long short-term memory model to estimate the future workload and reinforcement learning technique to make an appropriate scaling decision. The simulation results obtained under real and synthetic workloads demonstrate that the proposed solution increases the CPU utilization and reduces the execution time and energy consumption, compared with the other algorithms.

N2  - Abstract In the process of decision making (DM), to have more freedom in expressing DM experts' belief about membership and nonmembership grade, Yager presented the q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) as an extension of fuzzy sets. Recently, for aggregating discrete and continuous q-ROF information, many scholars provided various aggregation operators. However, there are still some kinds of continuous q-ROF information cannot be aggregated through existing aggregation operators. In this paper, we present two novel kinds of line integrals under the q-rung orthopair fuzzy environment (q-ROFE), which supply a wider range on method choice for multiple attribute decision making (MADM) concerning discrete or continuous q-ROF information. We first construct the first form of line integral under the q-ROFE and study their properties, we prove the specific condition mean valued theorem but negate the general condition for it. Besides, several inequalities with regard to it are also provided. After that, we give two characterization forms of the second form of line integral under the q-ROFE, we study the relationship between two kinds of line integrals. What is more important, we show the Green formula under q-ROFE, which connect the existing q-rung orthopair fuzzy integration theory. Afterward, we provide two kinds of aggregation operators on the basis of two line integrals, respectively. As their applications, we give two novel MADM methods based on two kinds of line integral aggregation operators. And some examples are shown to demonstrate the aggregation process of line integral operators. We not only stress their availabilities and superiorities on aggregating continuous q-ROF information, but also comparing with other existing aggregation methods for emphasizing the novel methods' abilities when deal with abnormal q-ROF information.

N2  - Abstract This study proposes multi-criteria group decision-making to address seismic physical vulnerability assessment. Granular computing rule extraction is combined with a feed forward artificial neural network to form a classifier capable of training a neural network on the basis of the rules provided by granular computing. It provides a transparent structure despite the traditional multi-layer neural networks. It also allows the classifier to be applied on a set of rules for each incoming pattern. Drawbacks of original granular computing (GrC) are covered, where some input patterns remained unclassified. The study was applied to classify seismic vulnerability of the statistical units of the city of Tehran, Iran. Slope, seismic intensity, height and age of the buildings were effective parameters. Experts ranked 150 randomly selected sample statistical units with respect to their degree of seismic physical vulnerability. Inconsistency of the experts' judgments was investigated using the induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator. Fifty-five classification rules were extracted on which a neural network was based. An overall accuracy of 88%, ??=?0.85 and R2?=?0.89 was achieved. A comparison with previously implemented methodologies proved the proposed method to be the most accurate solution to the seismic physical vulnerability of Tehran.

N2  - Abstract Previous studies on tourism land use primarily focus on the spatial distribution, and its related impacts on the environment. Here, we propose a future tourism land use simulation model for mountain vacations based on the cellular automata and Markov chain methods, having verified and simulated tourism land use in Emeishan city at a spatial resolution of 30 ? 30 m using remote sensing and GIS. In addition, we introduced a tourism land use intensity index to study the spatial expansion mode of tourism land use. The results have confirmed the validity of the model and demonstrated its ability to simulate future tourism land use. The average growth rate of tourism land use from 2010 to 2015 is 33.36%, and tourism land use will rise from 1.26% of Emeishan city?s land area in 2015 to 2.95% in 2030. Tourism land use shows a spatial expansion pattern along channels from scenic spots to the urban area. The growth of tourism land use in the protected area has an increasing trend when there is no restriction on development, especially in the Eshan region. The simulation results can provide useful implications and guides for regional tourism planning and management.

N2  - Objective To develop and validate an international set of classification criteria for primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) using guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). These criteria were developed for use in individuals with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of SS. Methods We assigned preliminary importance weights to a consensus list of candidate criteria items, using multi-criteria decision analysis. We tested and adapted the resulting draft criteria using existing cohort data on primary SS cases and non-SS controls, with case/non-case status derived from expert clinical judgment. We then validated the performance of the classification criteria in a separate cohort of patients. Results The final classification criteria are based on the weighted sum of 5 items: anti-SSA/Ro antibody positivity and focal lymphocytic sialadenitis with a focus score of ≥1 foci/4 mm2, each scoring 3; an abnormal ocular staining score of ≥5 (or van Bijsterveld score of ≥4), a Schirmer's test result of ≤5 mm/5 minutes, and an unstimulated salivary flow rate of ≤0.1 ml/minute, each scoring 1. Individuals with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of SS who have a total score of ≥4 for the above items meet the criteria for primary SS. Sensitivity and specificity against clinician-expert?derived case/non-case status in the final validation cohort were high, i.e., 96% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 92?98%) and 95% (95% CI 92?97%), respectively. Conclusion Using methodology consistent with other recent ACR/EULAR-approved classification criteria, we developed a single set of data-driven consensus classification criteria for primary SS, which performed well in validation analyses and are well-suited as criteria for enrollment in clinical trials.

N2  - Abstract In this paper, we propose a road traffic control method for reducing traffic congestion with a genetic algorithm. In the not too distant future, a system which controls the routes of all vehicles in a certain area must be realized. The system should optimize the routes of all vehicles, but the solution space of this problem is enormous. Therefore, we apply the genetic algorithm to this problem by encoding the route of all vehicles to a fixed length chromosome. To improve the search performance, a new genetic operator called ?path shortening? is also designed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown experimentally. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - With the increasing pressure on researchers to produce scientifically rigorous and relevant research, researchers need to find suitable publication outlets with the highest value and visibility for their manuscripts. Traditional approaches for discovering publication outlets mainly focus on manually matching research relevance in terms of keywords as well as comparing journal qualities, but other research-relevant information such as social connections, publication rewards, and productivity of authors are largely ignored. To assist in identifying effective publication outlets and to support effective journal recommendations for manuscripts, a three-dimensional profile-boosted research analytics framework (RAF) that holistically considers relevance, connectivity, and productivity is proposed. To demonstrate the usability of the proposed framework, a prototype system was implemented using the ScholarMate research social network platform. Evaluation results show that the proposed RAF-based approach outperforms traditional recommendation techniques that can be applied to journal recommendations in terms of quality and performance. This research is the first attempt to provide an integrated framework for effective recommendation in the context of scientific item recommendation.

A single system security metric, built from multiple components, is presented here as a fundamental system management security metric. This single technical security metric is used to support and evaluate the allocation of corporate and program resources, including time and budget.

N2  - Abstract The aim of this study is to evaluate several weaving knife configurations in response to multiple criteria?s for optimum design. Nine different knife combinations were tested over ten female weavers in a field experiment. Three levels of blade width and angular orientations were taken as the independent variables. Output response about goniometry and electromyography were taken as dependent variables. Multivariate analysis was carried out to estimate the effect of independent variables on output responses. To tackle the difficulty of knife selection with several output responses, three multicriteria optimization approaches have been compared. Multivariate analysis of variance results showed that the effect of both blade width and angle were significant at wrist angles. Also, the magnitude of effect size on both blade width and the angle was highest for the wrist angles. Despite the same weighing criteria, a slight difference was evident between the ranks from optimization methods. The higher blade widths and smaller angular orientations should be recommended for reduction of wrist deviation and muscle activity during weaving. The best possible combination of knife evaluated using multicriteria optimization was 25?mm???100°.

N2  - Summary Cloud computing and cloud applications are emerging as the latest technology. Cloud applications are developing very fast and adopted by most of the firms around the globe. The cloud applications are widely accepted and considered as a notion of the digitized era, but the cloud product lifecycle management (PLM) is not adopted much in Indian firms. Cloud PLM is an upcoming cloud application, but its adoption entails various challenges. Considering this fact, the paper aims to empirically investigate the critical challenges encountered by many firms for migration to of cloud PLM. A multicriteria decision making method, grey Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory along with interpretive structural modeling are employed to identify the causal challenges and their hierarchy to cloud PLM adoption. This empirical study brings out ?data security? and ?trust on solution provider? as the most important and critical challenges for migration to cloud PLM adoption. The findings may act as a guide for the managers in manufacturing firms in identifying the critical challenges to utilize the benefits of cloud PLM over on-premise PLM systems.

N2  - Abstract Deep learning is a powerful technology that enables intelligent data processing in the smart healthcare domain. Inspired by the tremendous processing power of cloud computing, the training process and the model repository of deep learning are moved to the cloud. Cloud-assisted deep learning applications enable smart mobile users to experience quick predictive results. Health professionals use smart mobile devices to convey recordings of the patient and to receive the best inference results. The mobility of these devices causes severe performance degradation as it increases the distance between its current location and the edge cloud where the virtual machines are provisioned. Therefore, mobility-based resource provisioning to identify a suitable server based on deadline constraints, available resources, and cost metrics is crucial. This paper proposes a proximity-based resource provisioning technique that guarantees minimal delay in obtaining inference results with a local mobile cloud system. The proposed technique comprises two algorithms (a) deadline-based initial resource provisioning and (b) resource migration and provisioning at suitable cloudlet during location change. The proposed technique is implemented in a mobile cloud platform running the inference method of a smart mobile healthcare application. The performance results show that the proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of the response time, deadline meeting percentage, and system utilization.

N2  - Summary Next generation wireless networks consist of many heterogeneous access technologies that should support various service types with different quality of service (QoS) constraints, as well as user, requirements and provider policies. Therefore, the need for network selection mechanisms that consider multiple factors must be addressed. In this paper, a network selection method is proposed by applying the analytic network process to estimate the weights of the selection criteria, as well as a fuzzy version of technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to perform the ranking of network alternatives. The method is applied to a heterogeneous network environment providing different QoS classes and policy characteristics. Each user applies the method to select the most appropriate network, which satisfies his or her requirements in respect of his or her service-level agreement (SLA). Performance evaluation shows that when the user requests only one service, the proposed method performs better compared to the original technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution, as well as the Fuzzy AHP-ELECTRE method. Moreover, the proposed method can be applied in cases where a user requires multiple services simultaneously on a device. The sensitivity analysis of the proposed method shows that it can be properly adjusted to conform to network environment changes. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - ABSTRACT For many decisions we make, we are more likely to receive feedback about some outcomes than about others, and thus we must operate under conditions of asymmetric partial feedback. In this paper, we examine the effects of asymmetric partial feedback on decision making across three experiments. Experiment 1 examines the effects of four partial feedback schedules on decision making in a single-attribute auditory detection task. Experiment 2 examines these same schedules in the context of a simulated experiment in which virtual participants perform a multi-attribute choice task. Experiment 3 then examines effects of one partial feedback schedule representative of a real-world decision-making domain (personnel selection) using an ecologically informed multi-attribute choice task. All three experiments reveal that asymmetric partial feedback primarily impacts on response-bias, a parameter of signal detection theory. These findings can be explained in terms of decision makers' attempts to maximize accuracy and the fact that shifts in response-bias will, under partial feedback, produce misleading impressions of greater accuracy.

N2  - Abstract We consider the problem of learning a function assigning objects into ordered categories. The objects are described by a vector of attribute values and the assignment function is monotone w.r.t. the attribute values (monotone sorting problem). Our approach is based on a model used in multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), called MR-Sort. This model determines the assigned class on the basis of a majority rule and an artificial object that is a typical lower profile of the category. MR-Sort is a simplified variant of the ELECTRE TRI method. We describe an algorithm designed for learning such a model on the basis of assignment examples. We compare its performance with choquistic regression, a method recently proposed in the preference learning community, and with UTADIS, another MCDA method leaning on an additive value function (utility) model. Our experimentation shows that MR-Sort competes with the other two methods, and leads to a model that is interpretable.

N2  - Abstract The aim of this study is to identify, rank, and determine the importance of factors influencing the selection of the top supplier of electronic procurement in organizations using a hybrid approach. This is a case study of Irancell Telecommunication Service Company in which fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation (FDEMATEL) and fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) were used. FDEMATEL was employed to determine the interaction and interrelationships among the identified criteria and subcriteria, while utilizing FANP to calculate the weights of the criteria and their relevant subcriteria to determine their priorities. Therefore, the research literature was first reviewed to identify the factors influencing the selection of suppliers. For this purpose, the experts on communication networks were interviewed to select 16 final factors as the most important subcriteria that were then categorized as 5 groups (technology, environmental, services, organizational, and commercial) on which the study was based. After extracting the criteria for ranking the suppliers, codifying evaluation questionnaire, and converting the opinions in the Likert scale, 16 criteria were finally chosen with scores above the mean. FDEMATEL was used to determine the weights of subcriteria. In the final step, FANP was employed for prioritization. Results indicate that the organizational criterion is the most influential factor; however, the criterion services is the most permeable factor. The greatest weights were obtained from production capacity and provisions and geographical situation which were weighted 0.097 and 0.039, respectively. They are also regarded as the most and least important criteria for the selection of the top supplier of e-procurement by the experts.

N2  - Abstract In many cases of practical multiattribute project portfolio selection problems, it is hard to obtain accurate measurements of attributes and precise preference information. Even after a long and costly information gathering, the attribute measurements and the preference information can still be uncertain or inaccurate. Considerable cost saving will be obtained if the selection of an optimal project portfolio can be done using rank-level information based on some or all the attributes, without knowing the preference information. In this paper, we propose a stochastic multiattribute acceptability analysis-based method that can deal with mixed rank and cardinal attribute measurements and uses little or no weight information. In the proposed stochastic multiattribute acceptability analysis-based method, the decision makers need not to express their preferences explicitly or implicitly, so it is particularly useful when no weight information is available at all. A numerical example involving selection of photovoltaic plants in an industrial province in Eastern China is provided to demonstrate the proposed method.

N2  - Abstract In Spain, the subtitling service on television for the deaf has been improving in quantity since the General Law on Audiovisual Communication was enacted in 2010. This law establishes a series of quality standards that must be followed in the subtitling process. One of the most relevant aspects of subtitle quality is the speed at which they are shown on the screen, due to the fact that a too high speed (less time on screen) will make them difficult to read and the information hard to understand. In order to determine whether the speed at which the subtitles are being shown is adequate, first, it is necessary to process all the information associated with the broadcast of the digital TV channels including data from different sources. In this research, the authors have worked with the data obtained within the time period between July 2012 and December 2017, that is, with more than 950 million records. This article presents a framework for integration and processing of heterogeneous information associated with the subtitling of audiovisual content from different sources. Moreover, the framework will provide an automatic adjustment of subtitles in broadcasting regarding quality indicators by means of a genetic algorithm approach. The results show that the system is able to estimate the best relationship between the time and size of the subtitles and maintaining the quality levels established for this research. These results have been validated by experts and users of this domain.

The evaluations of the relative importance of KPIs are called a fuzzy group-decision-making problem. The KPI weights are determined using the fuzzy analytic hierarchical process. The effectiveness of business objectives and KPIs is determined using the adopted Balanced Scorecard Designer Pro. Determination of the KPI rank with respect to each enterprise type is on the basis of Pareto analysis. The priority of management initiatives of the improvement strategy corresponds to the calculated rank, and it has a critical effect on the competitive advantage of any enterprise. The results discuss manufacturing, public and service enterprises, which exist in central Serbia. The proposed approach can also be adapted to different businesses.

N2  - Abstract Societies worldwide are investing considerable resources into the safe development and use of nanomaterials. Although each of these protective efforts is crucial for governing the risks of nanomaterials, they are insufficient in isolation. What is missing is a more integrative governance approach that goes beyond legislation. Development of this approach must be evidence based and involve key stakeholders to ensure acceptance by end users. The challenge is to develop a framework that coordinates the variety of actors involved in nanotechnology and civil society to facilitate consideration of the complex issues that occur in this rapidly evolving research and development area. Here, we propose three sets of essential elements required to generate an effective risk governance framework for nanomaterials. (1) Advanced tools to facilitate risk-based decision making, including an assessment of the needs of users regarding risk assessment, mitigation, and transfer. (2) An integrated model of predicted human behavior and decision making concerning nanomaterial risks. (3) Legal and other (nano-specific and general) regulatory requirements to ensure compliance and to stimulate proactive approaches to safety. The implementation of such an approach should facilitate and motivate good practice for the various stakeholders to allow the safe and sustainable future development of nanotechnology.

N2  - Abstract Delineation of flood-risk extent is a tedious task which normally requires the expertise of trained hydrologists. In order to provide a quicker and more automated approach for estimating flood-risk extent, three straightforward methods (Mahalanobis distance, Maximin and Equally likely decision methods) which are easily executed in Geographic Information System were investigated and applied to a study area in the so-called ?Tavoliere delle Puglie? (southern Italy). The delineated areas were then visually and statistically confronted with a methodology based on hydrologic expertise that can be considered up to date with current flood-risk zone delineation knowledge. Two major problems associated with flood-risk extent estimation are firstly the overwhelming complexity of the wide variety of spatially relevant flood-related data and the amount of information contained within these data that are not easily interpreted without often costly and time consuming hydrologic expertise, and secondly, the wide variety of criteria usually considered in flood-risk analysis, yielding a broad spectrum of different units involved. The comparative analysis has revealed that of the three alternative methods, only the Mahalanobis distance technique gave moderately comparable results with the methodology based on hydrologic expert knowledge. The results suggest and confirm that hydrologic expertise cannot be bypassed in flood-risk extent analysis.

N2  - Summary Mobile phones offer many potential social benefits throughout their lifetime, but this life is often much shorter than design intent. Reuse of the phone in a developing country allows these social benefits to be fully realized. Unfortunately, under the current state of development of recycling infrastructure, recovery rates of phones after reuse are very low in those markets, which may lead to an environmental burden attributed to loss of materials to landfill. In order to recover those materials most effectively, recycling in developed countries may be the best option, but at a cost of the ability to reuse the phones. The issues facing integration of social and environmental concerns into a single life cycle assessment (LCA) and resulting challenges of identifying the disposal option with the most sustainable outcome are explored using mobile phones as a case study. These include obtaining sufficient geographical and temporal detail of the end-of-life options, collation and analysis of the large amounts of data generated, and weighting of the disparate environmental and social impact categories. The numerous challenges may mount up to make performing LCA of mobile phones unwieldy. Instead of trying to encompass every aspect in full, it is proposed that focus is given to answering a question that takes into account the resources available: It is important to ask the question that has the best chance of being answered.

The Hammerstein nonlinearity is removed (or partially removed) by inverting it. By predicting the future control sequence, the random network-induced delay and data dropout are compensated actively. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed by applying the switched Lyapunov function approach. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.

N2  - Summary In this proposed method, with the aim of resolving the frequent route mining issue, by means of utilizing the Rapid Association Rule Mining (RARM) for frequent route mining, recurrently utilized routes as well as smaller distance routes are mined. As a result, support speedy decision of the route identify more willingly than the standard route optimization. Primarily, Multi-Ontology based Points of Interest (MO-POIs) model is presented that takes the POIs of user design in combination with the semantic info of the individual users. Furthermore, it as well takes another two steps that are along these lines: (1) routes ranking as per the similarity amid user package as well as routes packages are carried out by means of utilizing Parallel Semi-supervised enhanced fuzzy Co-Clustering (PSEFC) as well as (2) route optimizing by Parallel Ant Colony Optimization (PACO) technique in keeping with identical social users' records. The graph model is denoted as the amount of ants in the population of the identical user records. Assess the RARM-PSEFC recommendation system on a set of Flickr images uploaded by users as well as travel POIs in numerous cities and show its efficiency.

N2  - SUMMARY Nowadays, the requirement on diminishing operating and maintenance costs is highly concerned for utilities in competitive electricity market. Power transformer is first focused due to its acquisition costs and failure consequences (FCs). Traditional preventive maintenance for power transformer is generally applied. However, it is very costly and does not take into account actual transformer condition. Hence, risk-based maintenance is introduced in this paper to facilitate the maintenance works of power transformers. The conditions of power transformers are evaluated from electrical test, insulating oil test and visual inspection by using the ranking and weighting techniques. In addition, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is proposed to determine the important weighting factor of each transformer component. The three main criteria of the AHP are maintenance difficulty, FC and failure history. Moreover, the Weibull distribution techniques are applied to analyze failure causes. The computerized web-application program is developed and implemented for practical use in a utility in Thailand. The power transformers installed in 115 kV and 230 kV transmission systems in Thailand are assessed due to availability and quality of data. From statistical analysis of failure records, the conditions of power transformer can be divided into three different zones as risk, moderate and healthy zone. The defective components in risk zone with higher proportion of failure should be carefully focused. The components and overall condition of the transformers are perceived from the analysis of test results. Subsequently, the risk-based maintenance is properly planned according to the actual condition. Therefore, maintenance of power transformer fleet can be effectively managed resulting in higher availability and reliability, lower risk of failure and lower cost of maintenance.

N2  - ABSTRACT Threats to the individual identity on social media are real and problematic. Yet, there is a paucity of research on online identity management. We posit that identity management on social media requires a value perspective to determine gaps between what social media users want from online identity management and what social media sites offer through their current security and privacy controls. Following the design science research paradigm, we present an Identity Management Value Model (IMVM). Based on multiple-objectives decision analysis technique, the value model explicates a hierarchy of fundamental identity management objectives and quantifies the achievement of objectives on a social media site. The emergent value scores and value gaps provide an understanding of how well a social media site manages users online identity. We demonstrate the application of the value model for Facebook and assess a set of measures to reduce the value gaps on Facebook. We conducted sensitivity analysis followed by deterministic analysis to evaluate the value model. The evaluation results indicate that the modeling outcome is robust to a range of individual values and preferences. By focusing on individual values, this study extends the research on values in the context of identity management on social media. Social media companies might find the model useful for instituting identity management measures. Individual users could use the model for strategizing about personal identity management. Our study also demonstrates the usefulness of a retrospective design approach, accounting for user values in a principled and comprehensive manner.

N2  - Abstract Vegetation plays a vital role for sustainable rehabilitation of degraded lands such as badlands with active gully erosion. However, the establishment of plant species on badlands remains a long-lasting challenge in most regions, including the subhumid tropics. To address this challenge, 18 multipurpose plant species (six trees, three shrubs, and nine grasses), which were preselected from the regional species pool in Southwest Ethiopia, were planted in a badland and monitored from July 2011 to June 2014. The experiment had a split-plot design with farmyard manure (FYM) application as main plot and plant species as subplot factors repeated in three blocks. The study revealed that grasses were the most successful to survive and rehabilitate the gully within the monitoring period compared with trees and shrubs. The survival rate of the four most successful grass species, Chrysopogon zizanioides, Pennisetum macrourum, Pennisetum polystachion, and Pennisetum purpureum ranged from 61% to 90% with FYM application and from 20% to 85% without FYM, while most of the well-known indigenous and exotic trees and shrubs failed to survive. For the grass P. purpureum, shoot height, shoot, and root biomass were enhanced by 300%, 342%, and 578%, respectively, due to FYM application, with a remarkably higher response to FYM compared with all the other studied species. The overall results demonstrate that badlands can be effectively restored by using early successional species such as locally adapted and selected grasses before the plantation of trees and shrubs.

N2  - Abstract Selection of appropriate plant species for rehabilitation of degraded lands while fulfilling socio-economic interests of local communities is one of the decision-making challenges. This research was undertaken to select multipurpose trees, shrubs and grasses to stabilize degraded lands in the Gilgel Gibe catchment of Southwest Ethiopia, situated in the sub-humid tropics. Two multi-criteria decision analysis methods, analytical hierarchy process and simple multi-attribute rating technique, integrated in the excel-based multi-criteria tree selection tool, were used. Focus group discussions were held with experts and local communities to prioritize 40 plant species from a preselected regional pool of 129 species, using six criteria groups containing 47 individual criteria. Root characteristics of the top 9 ranked plants were studied for triangulating the multi-criteria decision analysis results. Both local communities and experts gave priority to indigenous trees over shrubs and grasses as the best five species for multipurpose use, whereas the top 5 species prioritized for riverbank stabilization contained both trees and grasses. In contrast, communities preferred indigenous trees, and experts selected grasses as the best five species for gully stabilization. The root system characterization revealed that the five top-ranked multipurpose species also have the required root characteristics for effectively reinforcing unstable slopes. However, communities prefer to plant Eucalyptus and Grevillea trees because of their short-term economic benefits although they understood the multipurpose value of indigenous plants. The trade-off between direct economic benefit and multipurpose benefits could be solved by awareness creation, incentives to communities and policy re-enforcement.

N2  - ABSTRACT We draw on extant literature on strategic sourcing and supply base rationalization to anchor our argument that measuring supplier performance diversity is germane to executing an effective supply base rationalization strategy. We explicate how a novel approach to data envelopment analysis (DEA) efficiency assessment can be utilized to measure this performance diversity. More specifically, our methods are anchored in cross efficiency analysis in DEA that allows for evaluating the efficiency of a supplier with respect to the optimal weights (strengths) of its peers. This methodology is applied to an actual supplier dataset of a large multinational telecommunications company in categorizing their supply base into groups for effective supplier rationalization. We conclude that measuring and analyzing the performance diversity within the framework of DEA provides a mechanism for firms to better balance a rationalized and diversified supply base with unique skills.

N2  - Summary A computational intelligence-based identification of the properties of maximally sustainable materials for a given application, as derived from key properties of existing candidate materials, is put forward. The correlation surface between material properties (input) and environmental impact (EI) values (output) of the candidate materials is initially created using general regression (GR) artificial neural networks (ANNs). Genetic algorithms (GAs) are subsequently employed for swiftly identifying the minimum point of the correlation surface, thus exposing the properties of the maximally sustainable material. The ANN is compared to and found to be more accurate than classic polynomial regression (PR) interpolation/prediction, with sensitivity and multicriteria analyses further confirming the stability of the proposed methodology under variations in the properties of the materials as well as the relative importance values assigned to the input properties. A nominal demonstration concerning material selection for manufacturing maximally sustainable liquid containers is presented, showing that by appropriately picking the pertinent input properties and the desired material selection criteria, the proposed methodology can be applied to a wide range of material selection tasks.

N2  - Objective To define candidate criteria within multiphase development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) classification criteria, jointly supported by the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism. Prior steps included item generation and reduction by Delphi exercise, further narrowed to 21 items in a nominal group technique exercise. Our objectives were to apply an evidence-based approach to the 21 candidate criteria, and to develop hierarchical organization of criteria within domains. Methods A literature review identified the sensitivity and specificity of the 21 candidate criteria. Data on the performance of antinuclear antibody (ANA) as an entry criterion and operating characteristics of the candidate criteria in early SLE patients were evaluated. Candidate criteria were hierarchically organized into clinical and immunologic domains, and definitions were refined in an iterative process. Results Based on the data, consensus was reached to use a positive ANA of ≥1:80 titer (HEp-2 cells immunofluorescence) as an entry criterion and to have 7 clinical and 3 immunologic domains, with hierarchical organization of criteria within domains. Definitions of the candidate criteria were specified. Conclusion Using a data-driven process, consensus was reached on new, refined criteria definitions and organization based on operating characteristics. This work will be followed by a multicriteria decision analysis exercise to weight criteria and to identify a threshold score for classification on a continuous probability scale.

N2  - Abstract Healthcare waste management (HCWM) has become the most concerned issue for hospitals to enhance their environmental performance while reducing the waste disposal costs. The present study aims to standardize the evaluation criteria for the stakeholders to ensure sustainable environmental development by safe disposal of infectious healthcare waste (HCW). The present study applied the fuzzy-Delphi method to scrutinize the criteria identified from the literature and experts' opinions and resulted in 20 subcriteria under the following six main dimensions: experience, relationship, environmental factors, technology and qualification, economic factors, and firm's capabilities. Further, this study proposed a hybrid approach based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) under fuzzy environment to analyze the importance and interrelationships of these listed criteria. The study also showed that the experts have given approximately 70% weightage to three main criteria: firms' capabilities, economic factors, and technology and qualification. The implications of the study would help the healthcare administration and Pollution Control Boards to prepare check sheets for recording HCWM practices and, hence, contribute to sustainable environmental development in an efficient way. Understanding the prioritized cause-group criteria would further protect hospitals' environment from the spread of infection caused by the HCW in the long run.

N2  - Abstract Qualification for the importance degree of service designs (SDs) is an essential stage in promoting accommodation performances to satisfy customers and gain market shares. Although various methods have been applied to derive the priorities of SDs, they do not effectively deal with the vagueness of information and the heterogeneity of decision makers (DMs). This study presents an improved quality function deployment (QFD) for prioritizing SDs. Multigranular unbalanced linguistic term sets are used to capture evaluators' ratings to cope with vague information. The multigranular linguistic information is unified by using a novel uniform method. This kind of information then is represented as linguistic distribution assessments using the concept of random preferences based on possibility interpretations of weight information. A consensus-based mathematical programming model is established to determine the weights of DMs. Moreover, a combined structure that combines maximizing deviation and best worst methods is used to derive basic weights of SDs. Finally, an illustrative example of island accommodation management in Weizhou Island is provided to demonstrate the applicability and advantages of the proposed QFD framework.

N2  - Abstract The objective of this study is to develop an integrated approach for solving multicriteria group decision-making problems with multigranular unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs). Firstly, a signed distance-based transformation function is proposed to unify multigranular unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic (HFL) assessments. Secondly, a mathematical programming model based on the maximum consensus is constructed to allocate decision-makers (DMs)' weights objectively. Thirdly, a new signed distance-based preference score function is defined to aggregate HFL assessments and determine the weak ranking of alternatives, and a novel preference, indifference, and incomparability test framework is constructed to identify the subtle relations among alternatives. On these bases, a signed distance-based ORESTE (Organísation, rangement et Synthèse de données relarionnelles, in French) method, in which knowledge regarding criterion values and weights are expressed as multigranular unbalanced HFLTSs, is developed to obtain the ranking of alternatives. Finally, an illustrative example, followed by sensitivity and comparative analyses, is presented to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

N2  - Climate change vulnerability assessment (CCVA) can inform adaptation policy and help in incorporating climate futures in planning. The literature on CCVA stems from a number of research paradigms (e.g., risk assessment, natural disaster management, and urban planning), therefore making it difficult to extract major directions and methodologies from this body of work. A large number of assessments are based, partly or totally, on indicators which bring up specific methodological problems and constraints. In this study, first, we discuss the most important methodological challenges facing indicator-based vulnerability assessment (IBVA) based on a set of key conceptual papers in the field. Second, we conduct a meta-analysis of a representative sample of peer-reviewed IBVA studies, to identify how current research on IBVA is engaging with these challenges. We attempt to elicit major thematic and methodological trends in this corpus with specific focus on issues related to geographical and temporal scales, aggregation, and nonlinearity. We find that health of ecosystems and biodiversity (28%), freshwater quantity and quality (12%), and public health (10%) have attracted the highest number of studies. Less than a third of the papers in our sample give some consideration to uncertainty and nonlinearity. Assessments typically use aggregation methods that are based on the Multiple Attribute Utility Theory despite the fact that IBVA rarely satisfies the theoretical requirements of this approach. A small percentage of IBVA studies critically scrutinize prevalent assessment methodologies or attempt to develop new ones, despite the raised questions in key theoretical papers about its methodological aspects.

N2  - Abstract Synthetic biology (SB) involves the alteration of living cells and biomolecules for specific purposes. Products developed using these approaches could have significant societal benefits, but also pose uncertain risks to human and environmental health. Policymakers currently face decisions regarding how stringently to regulate and monitor various SB applications. This is a complex task, in which policymakers must balance uncertain economic, political, social, and health-related decision factors associated with SB use. We argue that formal decision analytical tools could serve as a method to integrate available evidence-based information and expert judgment on the impacts associated with SB innovations, synthesize that information into quantitative indicators, and serve as the first step toward guiding governance of these emerging technologies. For this paper, we apply multi-criteria decision analysis to a specific case of SB, a micro-robot based on biological cells called ?cyberplasm.? We use data from a Delphi study to assess cyberplasm governance options and demonstrate how such decision tools may be used for assessments of SB oversight.

N2  - Abstract An overview of the research and development task established to demonstrate the feasibility of applying numerical tools (based on modelling and simulation) to Royal Australian Navy (RAN) capability management is given. Our focus in this task is on the materiel support aspects of the capability management process that are the responsibility of the RAN Class Logistics Offices in the Defence Materiel Organisation. For example, assistance is required in making decisions in resources allocation, maintenance scheduling, spares optimisation and obsolescence management. A learning cycle, which has its foundation in systems thinking and systems engineering, is introduced in this paper as a mechanism for continuous improvement and informed decision making. Tools and techniques that can be used to assist the activities in the learning cycle are described with appropriate examples. These tools and techniques include statistical analysis, knowledge discovery in databases, decision-making techniques, systems modelling and risk assessment. Also, some conclusions and future directions for this research program are presented.

N2  - Objective The 1980 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for systemic sclerosis (SSc) lack sensitivity for early SSc and limited cutaneous SSc. The present work, by a joint committee of the ACR and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), was undertaken for the purpose of developing new classification criteria for SSc. Methods Using consensus methods, 23 candidate items were arranged in a multicriteria additive point system with a threshold to classify cases as SSc. The classification system was reduced by clustering items and simplifying weights. The system was tested by 1) determining specificity and sensitivity in SSc cases and controls with scleroderma-like disorders, and 2) validating against the combined view of a group of experts on a set of cases with or without SSc. Results It was determined that skin thickening of the fingers extending proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints is sufficient for the patient to be classified as having SSc; if that is not present, 7 additive items apply, with varying weights for each: skin thickening of the fingers, fingertip lesions, telangiectasia, abnormal nailfold capillaries, interstitial lung disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension, Raynaud's phenomenon, and SSc-related autoantibodies. Sensitivity and specificity in the validation sample were, respectively, 0.91 and 0.92 for the new classification criteria and 0.75 and 0.72 for the 1980 ACR classification criteria. All selected cases were classified in accordance with consensus-based expert opinion. All cases classified as SSc according to the 1980 ACR criteria were classified as SSc with the new criteria, and several additional cases were now considered to be SSc. Conclusion The ACR/EULAR classification criteria for SSc performed better than the 1980 ACR criteria for SSc and should allow for more patients to be classified correctly as having the disease.

N2  - Abstract Sometimes experts, decisionmakers, and analysts are confronted with policy problems that involve deep uncertainty. Such policy problems occur when (1) the future is not known well enough to predict future changes to the system, (2) there is not enough knowledge regarding the appropriate model to use to estimate the outcomes, and/or (3) there is not enough knowledge regarding the weights stakeholders currently assign to the various criteria or will assign in the future. This paper presents an MCDA approach developed to deal with conditions of deep uncertainty, which is called Exploratory Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (EMCDA). EMCDA is based on exploratory modelling, which is a modelling approach that allows policy analysts to explore multiple hypotheses about the future world (using different consequence models, different scenarios, and different weights). An example of a policy problem that can benefit from this methodology is decision making on innovations for improving traffic safety. In order to improve traffic safety, much is expected from Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA), an in-vehicle system that supports the driver in keeping an appropriate speed. However, different MCDA studies on ISA give different results in terms of the estimates of real-world safety benefits of ISA and the willingness of stakeholders (e.g. the automotive industry) to supply ISA. The application of EMCDA to the implementation of ISA shows that it is possible to perform an MCDA in situations of deep uncertainty. A full analysis taking into account the complete uncertainty space shows that the best policy is to make mandatory an ISA system for young drivers (less than 24 years of age) that restricts them from driving faster than the speed limit. Based on different assumptions, the analysis also shows that ISA policies should not target older drivers. Copyright ? 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract This paper considers the statistical analysis of entomological count data from field experiments with genetically modified (GM) plants. Such trials are carried out to assess environmental safety. Potential effects on nontarget organisms (NTOs), as indicators of biodiversity, are investigated. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gives broad guidance on the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of GM plants. Field experiments must contain suitable comparator crops as a benchmark for the assessment of designated endpoints. In this paper, a detailed protocol is proposed to perform data analysis for the purpose of assessing environmental safety. The protocol includes the specification of a list of endpoints and their hierarchical relations, the specification of intended levels of data analysis, and the specification of provisional limits of concern to decide on the need for further investigation. The protocol emphasizes a graphical representation of estimates and confidence intervals for the ratio of mean abundances for the GM plant and its comparator crop. Interpretation relies mainly on equivalence testing in which confidence intervals are compared with the limits of concern. The proposed methodology is illustrated with entomological count data resulting from multiyear, multilocation field trials. A cisgenically modified potato line (with enhanced resistance to late blight disease) was compared to the original conventional potato variety in the Netherlands and Ireland in two successive years (2013, 2014). It is shown that the protocol encompasses alternative schemes for safety assessment resulting from different research questions and/or expert choices. Graphical displays of equivalence testing at several hierarchical levels and their interpretation are presented for one of these schemes. The proposed approaches should be of help in the ERA of GM or other novel plants.

N2  - Abstract A wide variety of hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) stationary phase surface chemistries are currently available. Although their selectivity can be considerably different, column comparison or clustering using peptides is limited. In this study, ten pharmaceutically relevant model peptides are analyzed on seven different HILIC columns (bare silica, amide, poly-hydroxyethyl aspartamide, diol and zwitterionic) for the evaluation of their performance and classification. The responses examined include single and multiple responses: plate number, asymmetry factor, LOD, geometric mean resolution, resolution product, time corrected resolution product, peak capacity and chromatographic response function. Column classification was performed using hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis. Moreover, the overall performance quality of the HILIC columns was compared using a linear desirability function. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis showed consistent clusters. The zwitterionic phase was clustered apart from the other HILIC columns and both poly-aspartamide columns were clustered together. In addition, the two bare silica phases represent two different clusters, and thus different selectivities. Overall, the responses showed the best performance for one of the bare silica columns (Alltima-Alltech), followed by the zwitterionic phase (ZIC)-HILIC. Thus, these columns, belonging to different clusters, were found to be the best performing systems in pharmaceutical peptide analysis for the selected peptide set.

N2  - Abstract Soils are indispensable for the provision of several functions. Agricultural intensification and its focus on increasing primary productivity (PP) poses a threat to soil quality, due to increases in nutrient loads, greenhouse gas emissions and declining biodiversity. The EU Horizon 2020 Landmark project has developed multi-criteria decision models to assess five soil functions: PP, nutrient cycling (NC), soil biodiversity and habitat provision (B-HP), climate mitigation and water regulation, simultaneously in agricultural fields. Using these algorithms, we evaluated the supply of PP, NC and B-HP of 31 grasslands and 21 croplands as low, medium or high. The multi-criteria decision models showed that 38% of the farms had a medium to high supply of all three soil functions, whereas only one cropland had a high supply for all three. Forty-eight per cent of the farms were characterized by a high supply of PP and NC. We observed a clear trade-off between these two functions and B-HP. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated that higher organic inputs combined with a lower mineral fertilization concur with higher biodiversity scores while maintaining a medium delivery of PP and NC. Additionally, we compared the outputs of the model predictions to independent variables that served as proxies for the soil functions and found: (a) croplands (but not grasslands) with high PP had a higher standardized yield than those with medium PP; (b) grasslands (but not croplands) with high NC had a significantly lower fungal to bacterial biomass ratio, suggesting faster decomposition channels; and (c) a positive though non-significant trend between B-HP score and rank according to soil invertebrate biodiversity. These comparisons suggest a successful upscaling of the models from field to farm level. Our study highlights the need for systematic collection of management-related data for the assessment of soil functions. Multifunctionality can be achieved in agricultural soils; however, without specifically managing for it, biodiversity might come at a loss. Highlights We study how well soils can provide primary productivity, nutrient cycling and biodiversity. We study trade-offs and synergies among soil functions, as well as the drivers of these relationships. Soil biodiversity is largely sacrificed for primary productivity and nutrient cycling Changes in pesticide and fertilizer management can increase soil multifunctionality.

N2  - Abstract Complexity of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and difficulty to predict their behaviour in wireless communications make modelling of IoT units an important research topic. The IoT unit is considered here as the two-node IoT model that supports bi-directional wireless communications. There are many approaches to model security and energy awareness; however, little is known about the synergistic effect of those factors at the application level under the influence of environmental factors such as noise. The paper introduces a modelling framework to model the security-energy-environment issues as main attributes to allow defining quality of service (QoS) for the IoT-based applications. Among others, the healthcare ones are regarded as predominant now. We model IoT units using the feature-based modelling methodology adopted from the software engineering domain. The result of modelling is a set of feature models with valid configurations that describe the energy-security-environment-performance relationships and possible constraints to support various IoT applications. Having feature models, we can select a configuration that is best suited for a given IoT application with respect to QoS requirements. As feature models represent abstract relationships of domain factors, we need additionally to provide experiments to determine concrete values of modelled features. We describe the experimental system to measure energy consumption under the influencing factors. Both models (abstract and concrete) allow reasoning about QoS of the IoT applications.

N2  - ABSTRACT The Kokemäenjoki River Basin is the fourth largest in Finland. The city of Pori at the delta of the river is the most significant flood risk area in Finland. The preparation of a flood risk management plan (FRMP) for the Kokemäenjoki River Basin as a national pilot began in 2007 and will be finalised during 2011. The main challenges of the FRMP are the reconciliation of flood risks and various interests in different parts of the river basin, and adaptation to climate change. It has been predicted that climate change will alter the flood dynamics of the Kokemäenjoki River: the highest flow peaks will shift from spring to late autumn and winter and the risk of ice jam floods will increase. Development of the existing early warning systems and adaptive lake regulation practices are the two most important non-structural measures for preventing and mitigating flood damage. A new channel in the mid-river reach would help to manage the increasing winter flows. Also robust structural flood protection measures will be needed in the city of Pori. Nevertheless, close collaboration among authorities, municipalities and water body regulators will be critical in successful flood risk management in the Kokemäenjoki River Basin.

N2  - SUMMARY This work describes the development, implementation, and assessment of enhanced variants of three different groups of bio-inspired methodologies: genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and artificial immune system. The algorithms are implemented on a computational tool for the synthesis and optimization of offshore oil production risers that connect a floating platform at the sea surface to the wellheads at the sea bottom. Optimization procedures using bio-inspired algorithms for such real-world engineering problems require the calculation of the objective function through a large number of time-consuming finite element nonlinear dynamic analyses, for the evaluation of the structural behavior of each candidate configuration. Therefore, the performance of the algorithms may be measured by the smaller number of objective function evaluations associated to a given target fitness value. The results indicate that the artificial immune system approach, incorporating some enhancements presented in this work, is more effective than the genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization methods, requiring a smaller number of evaluations to obtain better solutions.

N2  - The Social Web is characterized by a massive diffusion of unfiltered content, directly generated by users via the spread of different social media platforms. In this context, a challenging issue is to assess the veracity of the information generated within the sites of online reviews. To address this issue, a common practice in the literature is to select and analyze some veracity features associated with users and their reviews, by mostly applying machine learning techniques, to provide a classification in genuine and deceptive reviews. In this paper, we do not focus on the feature selection and user behavior analysis issues, but we concentrate on the aggregation process with respect to each single veracity feature. In most of the approaches based on machine learning techniques, the contribution of each feature in the classification process is not measurable by the user. For this reason, we propose a multicriteria decision making approach based both on the assessment of multiple criteria and the use of aggregation operators with the aim of obtaining a veracity score associated with each review. Based on this score, it is possible to detect fake reviews. The proposed model is evaluated on a Yelp data set by applying different aggregation schemes, and it is compared with well-known supervised machine learning techniques.

N2  - In the Social Web scenario, where large amounts of User Generated Content diffuse through Social Media, the risk of running into misinformation is not negligible. For this reason, assessing and mining the credibility of both sources of information and information itself constitute nowadays a fundamental issue. Credibility, also referred as believability, is a quality perceived by individuals, who are not always able to discern with their cognitive capacities genuine information from the fake one. For this reason, in the recent years several approaches have been proposed to automatically assess credibility in Social Media. Most of them are based on data-driven models, i.e., they employ machine-learning techniques to identify misinformation, but recently also model-driven approaches are emerging, as well as graph-based approaches focusing on credibility propagation. Since multiple social applications have been developed for different aims and in different contexts, several solutions have been considered to address the issue of credibility assessment in Social Media. Three of the main tasks facing this issue and considered in this article concern: (1) the detection of opinion spam in review sites, (2) the detection of fake news and spam in microblogging, and (3) the credibility assessment of online health information. Despite the high number of interesting solutions proposed in the literature to tackle the above three tasks, some issues remain unsolved; they mainly concern both the absence of predefined benchmarks and gold standard datasets, and the difficulty of collecting and mining large amount of data, which has not yet received the attention it deserves.

N2  - ABSTRACT Although remediation is usually aimed at reducing the risks posed by contaminants to human health and the environment, it is also desirable that the remediated soil within future green spaces is capable of providing relevant ecological functions, e.g., basis for primary production. Yet while addressing a contamination problem by reducing contaminant concentration and/or amounts in the soil, the remedial action itself can lead to soil structure disturbances, decline in organic matter and nutrient deficiencies, and in turn affect a soil's capacity to carry out its ecological soil functions. This article presents the Soil Function Box (SF Box) tool that is aimed to facilitate integration of information from suggested soil quality indicators (SQIs) into a management process in remediation using a scoring method. The scored SQIs are integrated into a soil quality index corresponding to 1 of 5 classes. SF Box is applied to 2 cases from Sweden (Kvillebäcken and Hexion), explicitly taking into consideration uncertainties in the results by means of Monte Carlo simulations. At both sites the generated soil quality indices corresponded to a medium soil performance (soil class 3) with a high certainty. The main soil constraints at both Kvillebäcken and Hexion were associated with biological activity in the soil, as soil organisms were unable to supply plant-available N. At the Kvillebäcken site the top layer had a content of coarse fragment (??>?2?mm) higher than 35%, indicating plant rooting limitations. At the Hexion site, the soil had limited amount of organic matter, thus poor aggregate stability and nutrient cycling potential. In contrast, the soil at Kvillebäcken was rich in organic matter. The soils at both sites were capable of storing a sufficient amount of water for soil organisms between precipitation events. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2014;10:566?575. ? 2014 SETAC

N2  - Objective IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) can cause fibroinflammatory lesions in nearly any organ. Correlation among clinical, serologic, radiologic, and pathologic data is required for diagnosis. This work was undertaken to develop and validate an international set of classification criteria for IgG4-RD. Methods An international multispecialty group of 86 physicians was assembled by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Investigators used consensus exercises, existing literature, derivation and validation cohorts of 1,879 subjects (1,086 cases, 793 mimickers), and multicriterion decision analysis to identify, weight, and test potential classification criteria. Two independent validation cohorts were included. Results A 3-step classification process was developed. First, it must be demonstrated that a potential IgG4-RD case has involvement of at least 1 of 11 possible organs in a manner consistent with IgG4-RD. Second, exclusion criteria consisting of a total of 32 clinical, serologic, radiologic, and pathologic items must be applied; the presence of any of these criteria eliminates the patient from IgG4-RD classification. Third, 8 weighted inclusion criteria domains, addressing clinical findings, serologic results, radiology assessments, and pathology interpretations, are applied. In the first validation cohort, a threshold of 20 points had a specificity of 99.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 97.2?99.8%) and a sensitivity of 85.5% (95% CI 81.9?88.5%). In the second, the specificity was 97.8% (95% CI 93.7?99.2%) and the sensitivity was 82.0% (95% CI 77.0?86.1%). The criteria were shown to have robust test characteristics over a wide range of thresholds. Conclusion ACR/EULAR classification criteria for IgG4-RD have been developed and validated in a large cohort of patients. These criteria demonstrate excellent test performance and should contribute substantially to future clinical, epidemiologic, and basic science investigations.

N2  - Abstract The quality of patient safety evaluation provides important results for patients, doctors, and managers because it determines hospitals? capabilities to enhance the medical quality and influences the development of nonmedical error. The aim of this study is to propose a fuzzy multicriteria decision model to evaluate the quality of patient safety in hospitals in Taiwan. The staff and committees of 4 hospitals from southern Taiwan were invited, and these hospitals were evaluated based on 5 indicators from the human factors perspective. Fuzzy Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods are examined in the proposed model. The results show that not only the supervisor's commitment but also the hospital's patient safety enhancement capability should be taken into account in a competitive environment.

N2  - Abstract This paper describes a Generalized Reuse Framework for systems development that consists of two interrelated and interacting processes ? Development with Reuse (DWR) and Development for Reuse (DFR) ? and a parametric cost estimating relationship defined for the framework in an extended form of COSYSMO, a systems engineering cost estimating model. It also discusses the Delphi process undertook to derive the model coefficients or the quantitative weights for the defined reuse categories. The framework, along with the quantitative estimating model, can be directly applied, in more ways than one, to planning, evaluating and managing reuse for system development efforts.

N2  - Abstract The hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy set is frequently considered as a solution for decision making under uncertainty. Whereas the representation of uncertain information might be not sufficient in the hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy environment, thus the concept of interval-valued hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy sets (IVHPFSs) is proposed. Specifically, we first propose the concept of IVHPFSs and then study the operational rules and distance measures of IVHPFSs in detail. To ease the possible application, we explore two decision-making processes in the setting of IVHPFSs by drawing support from the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution and Choquet integral-based method. Finally, the selecting processes of project private partner are also presented to demonstrate the decision-making processes based on IVHPFSs and compared with some similar techniques.

N2  - Abstract Existing methods of spatial data clustering have focused on point data, whose similarity can be easily defined. Due to the complex shapes and alignments of polygons, the similarity between non-overlapping polygons is important to cluster polygons. This study attempts to present an efficient method to discover clustering patterns of polygons by incorporating spatial cognition principles and multilevel graph partition. Based on spatial cognition on spatial similarity of polygons, four new similarity criteria (i.e. the distance, connectivity, size and shape) are developed to measure the similarity between polygons, and used to visually distinguish those polygons belonging to the same clusters from those to different clusters. The clustering method with multilevel graph-partition first coarsens the graph of polygons at multiple levels, using the four defined similarities to find clusters with maximum similarity among polygons in the same clusters, then refines the obtained clusters by keeping minimum similarity between different clusters. The presented method is a general algorithm for discovering clustering patterns of polygons and can satisfy various demands by changing the weights of distance, connectivity, size and shape in spatial similarity. The presented method is tested by clustering residential areas and buildings, and the results demonstrate its usefulness and universality.

N2  - Abstract In China, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasingly affecting people's health. Although many risk factors related to T2DM have been researched, the association between social relationships and risk management of T2DM in China has not been fully researched. Therefore, we obtained 2,969 valid cases from the National Chinese Medicine Clinical Research Base-Key Disease of Diabetes Mellitus Study to evaluate the role of social relationships in the risk management of T2DM. We first establish an indicators system of social relationship factors and then propose a comprehensive method that integrates subjective (analytical network process) and objective (entropy weight method) evaluations to rank the importance of the 17 social relationship factors that were the most important and commonly used. The results suggest that different social relationship factors have different effects on the risk management of T2DM. Patients and health workers should pay more attention to the high-benefit factors and thus improve the efficiency of the risk management of T2DM. These findings provided theoretical support for patients and health workers by developing the positive effects of social relationships in improving the risk management of T2DM to the fullest degree.

N2  - Abstract Background Benefit-risk assessment (BRA) concept has been increasingly used in drug evaluation, and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is one of the recommended BRA tools. The objective of this study was to assess benefits and risks of statins (lipid lowering agents) by MCDA, based on patient's, clinical expert's and policymaker's perspectives. Methods Benefit and risk criteria and levels of statins were identified from literatures and interviews of stakeholders. SWING weight technique, which asked stakeholders to choose the most preferred criterion if they change its level from minimum to maximum, was used to measure the weight of each criterion. There were six patients, six clinical experts and 10 policymaker groups. Each group had four members and was asked to discuss and make consensus for giving their importance scores to four benefit and risk criteria (stroke event reduction, myocardial infarction event reduction, myalgia and hepatotoxicity). The collected scores were used to calculate the criteria weights. The criterion weights were multiplied by each statin's criterion scores to calculate the total weighted score of each statin. Total weighted scores were used to rank the order of statins, which reflected the preference order of statins in each perspective. Results From four perspectives (patients, experts, policymakers and overall), the most and least important criteria were myocardial infarction reduction and myalgia, respectively. Patients and experts agreed on the order of importance for stroke reduction and hepatotoxicity, but policymakers had a different order. From expert, policymaker and overall perspectives, atorvastatin had the highest total weighted score, followed by simvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin. However, patient group agreed only with the orders of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin. Conclusions Atorvastatin was the most preferred statin across all perspectives. This study presented the feasibility of applying MCDA in drug evaluation process and encouraged the engagement of multi-stakeholders in decision-making process.

N2  - Abstract This paper presents an efficiency assessment of the Angolan banks using Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-making technique similar to data envelopment analysis, which ranks a finite set of units based on the minimisation of distance from an ideal point and the maximisation of distance from an anti-ideal point. In this research, TOPSIS is used first in a two-stage approach to assess the relative efficiency of Angolan banks using the most frequent indicators adopted by the literature. Then, in the second stage, neural networks are combined with TOPSIS results as part of an attempt to produce a model for banking performance with effective predictive ability. The results reveal that variables related to cost structure have a prominent negative impact on efficiency. Findings also indicate that the Angolan banking market would benefit from higher level of competition between institutions.

N2  - Abstract This paper presents a performance assessment of 88 Association of Southeast Asian Nations banks from 2010 to 2013, using an integrated three-stage approach on financial criteria that emulates the CAMELS rating system. More precisely, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is used first to assess the relative weights of a number of criteria related to capital adequacy (C), asset quality (A), management quality (M), earnings (E), liquidity (L), and sensitivity to market risk (S) based on the opinion of 88 Association of Southeast Asian Nations experts. Then, these weights are used as technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution inputs to assess their relative efficiency. Lastly, neural networks are combined with technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution results to produce a model for banking performance with effective predictive ability. The results reveal that contextual variables have a prominent impact on efficiency. Specifically, parsimony in equity leveraging derived from Islamic finance principles may be the underlying cause in explaining higher efficiency levels.

N2  - A number of hurdles must be overcome in order to integrate unmanned aircraft into civilian airspace for routine operations. The ability of the aircraft to land safely in an emergency is essential to reduce the risk to people, infrastructure, and aircraft. To date, few field-demonstrated systems have been presented that show online replanning and repeatability from failure to touchdown. This paper presents the development of the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) component of an automated emergency landing system (AELS) intended to address this gap, suited to a variety of fixed-wing aircraft. Field-tested on both a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Cessna 172R during repeated emergency landing experiments, a trochoid-based path planner computes feasible trajectories, and a simplified control system executes the required maneuvers to guide the aircraft toward touchdown on a predefined landing site. This is achieved in zero-thrust conditions with engine forced to idle to simulate failure. During an autonomous landing, the controller uses airspeed, inertial, and GPS data to track motion and maintains essential flight parameters to guarantee flyability, while the planner monitors glide ratio and replans to ensure approach at correct altitude. Simulations show reliability of the system in a variety of wind conditions and its repeated ability to land within the boundary of a predefined landing site. Results from field-tests for the two aircraft demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GNC system in live operation. Results show that the system is capable of guiding the aircraft to close proximity of a predefined keyhole in nearly 100% of cases.

N2  - Abstract This research evaluates performance of a rapid assessment framework for screening surface water flood risk in urban catchments. Recent advances in modelling have developed fast and computationally efficient cellular automata frameworks which demonstrate promising utility for increasing available evidence to support surface water management, however, questions remain regarding trade-offs between accuracy and speed for practical application. This study evaluates performance of a rapid assessment framework by comparing results with outputs from an industry standard hydrodynamic model using a case study of St Neots in Cambridgeshire, UK. Results from the case study show that the rapid assessment framework is able to identify and prioritise areas of flood risk and outputs flood depths which correlate above 97% with the industry standard approach. In theory, this finding supports a simplified representation of catchments using cellular automata, and in practice presents an opportunity to apply the framework to develop evidence to support detailed modelling.

N2  - Abstract The construction of fishways for upstream and downstream connectivity is the preferred mitigation measure for hydropower dams and other riverine barriers. Yet empirical evidence for effective design criteria for many species is missing. We therefore assembled a group of international fishway designers and combined their knowledge with available empirical data using a formal expert elicitation protocol and Bayesian networks. The expert elicitation method we use minimizes biases typically associated with such approaches. Demonstrating our application with a case-study on the temperate Southern Hemisphere, we use the resulting probabilistic models to predict the following, given alternative design parameters: (i) the effectiveness of technical fishways for upstream movement of migratory fish; (ii) habitat quality in nature-like bypasses for resident fish; and (iii) rates of mortality during downstream passage of all fish through turbines and spillways. The Fish Passage Network (Fish-Net) predicts that fishways for native species could be near 0% or near 100% efficient depending on their design, suggesting great scope for adequate mitigation. Sensitivity analyses revealed the most important parameters as follows: (i) design of attraction and entrance features of technical fishways for upstream migration; (ii) habitat preferences of resident fish in nature-like bypasses; and (iii) susceptibility of fish to barotrauma and blade strike during turbine passage. Numerical modelling predicted that mortality rates of small-bodied fish (50?100 mm TL) due to blade strike may be higher for Kaplan than Francis turbines. Our findings can be used to support environmentally sustainable decisions in the planning, design and monitoring stages of hydropower development.

N2  - Abstract Although robust and consistent long-term datasets are lacking, it is commonly accepted that sea turtle populations face significant human threats while using Mozambique's coastal habitats. While multiple threats have been identified, their relative impact ? and thus the ability to prioritize limited conservation resources ? is poorly known. To obtain a better understanding of these threats, information from experts was elicited through a semi-structured survey using open and closed-ended questions. Experts in research, conservation and management of sea turtles were identified and asked to identify key threats and to complete pairwise comparison matrixes to determine the relative weight (w) of each threat (13 criterion, n = 24 questions). Weights for the perceived impact of threats were calculated from scores given in the pair-wise matrix using the analytic hierarchy process. Responses (n = 18) to open-ended survey questions were thematically coded and discussed according to common themes (e.g. extent of knowledge, limitations, conservation management tools) identified. Bycatch from commercial trawling (w = 13.65), artisanal fishing (w = 12.30) and hunting of nesting turtles (w = 11.33) were the top threats identified, in order of relative impact. While two of the three top threats are widely distributed and likely to be logistically and resource intensive to address, the top-scoring threat, ?bycatch from commercial trawling', is a clearly defined target for conservation intervention. Given a lack of baseline or published data, soliciting expert opinion was an efficient way to identify emergent threats, along with the success and limiting factors influencing sea turtle conservation in a developing nation. The methodology and technique implemented here are transferable. Expert surveys can provide valuable insights in locations with similar socio-economic environments and limited empirical data to help clarify the relative impact of various threats.

N2  - Abstract Lead time, defined as the duration between the moment a request was filed and the moment the decision was made, is an important aspect of decision making in market-driven requirements engineering. Minimizing lead time allows software companies to focus their resources on the most profitable functionality and enables them to remain competitive within the quickly changing software market. Achieving and sustaining low decision lead time and the resulting high decision efficiency require a better understanding of factors that may affect both decision lead time and outcome. In order to identify possible factors, we conducted an exploratory two-stage case study that combines the statistical analysis of seven possible relationships among decision characteristics at a large company with a survey of industry participants. Our results show that the number of products affected by a decision increases the time needed to make a decision. Practitioners should take this aspect into consideration when planning for efficient decision making and possibly reducing the complexity of decisions. Our results also show that when a change request originates from an important customer, the request is more often accepted. The results provide input into the discussion of whether a large company should focus on only a few of its large customers and disregard its significantly larger group of small customers. The results provide valuable insights for researchers, who can use them to plan research of decision-making processes and methods, and for practitioners, who can use them to optimize their decision-making processes. In future work, we plan to investigate other decision characteristics, such as the number of stakeholders involved in the discussion about the potential change or the number of dependencies between software components.

N2  - Abstract Attribute-oriented induction (AOI) is a data analysis technique based on induction. The traditional AOI algorithm requires a threshold given by users to determine the number of output tuples. However, it is not easy to set an appropriate tuple threshold, and there is usually noise contained in a dataset. The traditional AOI algorithm can only generate a summary output of a fixed size, but it cannot guarantee that all generalized tuples have sufficient specificity and representativeness. In this article, a new AOI method is proposed to make up for the shortcomings. We introduce the concept of cost to measure the loss of accuracy due to attribute ascension. We also propose two algorithms based on the hierarchical clustering method. By setting cost constraints on each generalized tuple, our method can generate accurate output while eliminating noise, and help users get more informative and clearer results.

N2  - Summary Scientific scheduling of limited resource plays an important role in the remote sensing data processing. The remote sensing data processing task scheduling is characterized as one novel comprehensive multi-objective model. In this proposed model, the remote sensing data processing task scheduling problem is divided into task dispensation and task scheduling sub-problem with hundreds of variables being considered in it. In order to effectively solve this problem, Bayes belief model is applied to generate the initial dispensation plan, and learnable ant colony optimization is proposed to solve task scheduling sub-problem. Experimental results suggest that the proposed comprehensive multi-objective model and its solving methods are feasible and efficient to remote sensing data processing task scheduling, and it also promotes processing centers interoperability among heterogeneous and dispersed processing center. The model and the method of this paper can provide a valuable reference for solving other complex scheduling problem.

N2  - Abstract The uncertainty and complexity of the decision-making environment and the subjectivity of the decision makers will lead to the inevitable errors of the decision-making data. A poor decision will be produced with those errors, whereas the linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis of preference (LINMAP) method can adjust such errors through constructing an optimal programming model based on the consistency of the decision-making information, and it has been applied widely in multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM). Moreover, Pythagorean fuzzy information is useful to simulate the ambiguous and uncertain decision-making environment. Therefore, the LINMAP method under the Pythagorean fuzzy circumstance will be proposed in this paper to solve MAGDM problems. To measure the fuzziness and uncertainty of Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) and interval-valued PFS, Pythagorean fuzzy entropy (PFE) and interval-valued PFE (IVPFE) grounded on the similarity and hesitancy parts have been defined, respectively. Then, Pythagorean fuzzy LINMAP (PF LINMAP) methods are constructed on the basis of the PFE and IVPFE correspondingly. Under the given preference relations, the maximum consistency and the amount of knowledge can be realized by the proposed methods. After investigating the relevant indicator system, the decision-making problem concerning railway project investment has been solved through the proposed PF LINMAP method with PFE. Finally, the practicability and effectiveness of the PF LINMAP method has been verified via the comparative analysis with the existing methods.

N2  - A robust multi-response optimization framework is proposed for simultaneously optimizing multiple conflicting quality characteristics. Unlike prior methods, the proposed approach is insensitive to subjective inputs like target specifications and improves optimization process for correlated responses. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated and compared with existing methods considering two examples from the literature. The proposed method yields similar results consistently for different assigned target values demonstrating repeatability of the model, hence demonstrating insensitivity to assigned subjective target values. Furthermore, the study also considers multiple correlated design characteristics issue to achieve better trade-off during design optimization. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Abstract Human society is experiencing a rapidly changing environment in which energy shortages and an ongoing climate crisis have been identified as two of the major challenges to the sustainable development of human civilization. In the face of these challenges, the concept of a smart city is proposed which aims at achieving sustainable development, increasing the quality of life, and improving the cost-effectiveness of existing and new energy infrastructures. To this end, this study proposes a general framework with a three-tier story chart for guiding the establishment of sustainability assessment models and the selection of their indicators. In addition, a quantitative analysis method is developed for assessing the sustainability of energy infrastructures in a smart city, which indicates how the long-term sustainability of the energy infrastructure can be achieved. The proposed method incorporates extensive environmental, economic, and social indicators, which go beyond conventional facility-level criteria and seamlessly relate to the broader community that benefits from the renewable energy transition (including energy construction, operations, and energy services). The proposed methodologies can be implemented through collecting the corresponding history data of the indicators and following the analysis procedures presented in this study. The proposed methodology can serve as a supporting tool for decision-making on new infrastructure investment and policymaking toward sustainable development. Case studies in Western Sydney were carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methodologies.

N2  - ABSTRACT The need for high-concentration formulations for subcutaneous delivery of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can present manufacturability challenges for the final ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) step. Viscosity levels and the propensity to aggregate are key considerations for high-concentration formulations. This work presents novel frameworks for deriving a set of manufacturability indices related to viscosity and thermostability to rank high-concentration mAb formulation conditions in terms of their ease of manufacture. This is illustrated by analyzing published high-throughput biophysical screening data that explores the influence of different formulation conditions (pH, ions, and excipients) on the solution viscosity and product thermostability. A decision tree classification method, CART (Classification and Regression Tree) is used to identify the critical formulation conditions that influence the viscosity and thermostability. In this work, three different multi-criteria data analysis frameworks were investigated to derive manufacturability indices from analysis of the stress maps and the process conditions experienced in the final UF/DF step. Polynomial regression techniques were used to transform the experimental data into a set of stress maps that show viscosity and thermostability as functions of the formulation conditions. A mathematical filtrate flux model was used to capture the time profiles of protein concentration and flux decay behavior during UF/DF. Multi-criteria decision-making analysis was used to identify the optimal formulation conditions that minimize the potential for both viscosity and aggregation issues during UF/DF. Biotechnol.

N2  - Abstract Along with rapid global urbanization, cities are challenged by environmental risks and resource scarcity. Sustainable urban planning is central to address the dilemma of economic growth and ecosystem protection, where the use of land is critical. Sustainable land use patterns are spatially explicit in nature, and can be structured and addressed using spatial optimization integrating GIS and mathematical models. This research discusses prominent sustainability concerns in land use planning and suggests a generalized multi-objective spatial optimization model to facilitate conventional planning. The model is structured to meet land use demand while satisfying the requirements of the physical environment, society and economy. Unlike existing work relying on raster data, due to its simple data structure and ease of spatial relationship evaluation, this research develops an approach for identifying land use solutions based on vector data that better reflects the actual shape and spatial layout of land parcels as well as the ways land use information is managed in practice. An evolutionary algorithm is developed to find the set of efficient (Pareto) solutions given the complexity of vector-based representations of space. The proposed approach is applied in an empirical study of Dafeng, China in order to support local urban growth and development. The results demonstrate that spatial optimization can be a powerful tool for deriving effective and efficient land use planning strategies. A comparison to results using a raster data approach supports the superiority of land use optimization using vector data as part of planning practice.

N2  - Abstract Fault tree analysis (FTA) as an effective and efficient risk assessment tool are widely used to analyze the reliability of a complex system. In this context, FTA can properly improve the safety performance of the system by preventing an event which may lead to occurrence of a catastrophic accident. However, traditional FTA is still suffering from dynamic structure demonstration and importantly epistemic uncertainty processing. In this study, a novel methodology is introduced using Bayesian updating mechanism to deal with dynamic structure and 2-tuple fuzzy set named as intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are employed to cope with subjectivity of uncertainty processing. Accordingly, the most critical system components which affect the system reliability are recognized by using an appropriate sensitivity analysis method. The proposed methodology is then applied on a real case study application (a brake fluid filling system) in order to examine the effectiveness and feasibility of the approach. The results illustrated that the new methodology can have enough benefits for diagnosing the systems' faults compared with listing approaches of safety and reliability analysis. In terms of empirical case study, ?electromotor failure? was evaluated as the second most critical basic event in conventional-based approaches, whereas in the novel methodology ?high pressure liquefied material? was recognized as the second one.

N2  - Abstract Industrial symbiosis (IS) employs a cross-organizational perspective to seek synergistic pairings of one company's waste output to another company's input, enabled by interfirm cooperation through resource and information sharing. Orchestrating IS relationships among companies, however, remains a complex process. In the literature, a wide range of qualitative and quantitative tools have emerged, tackling issues ranging from identifying IS creation opportunities to performance evaluation. Thus far, the available literature has focused on separate aspects and perspective of IS creation. Each individual work contributes, in part, to the overall process of IS creation. The disparate perspectives provided by the literature reflect the fragmented nature of available tools supporting IS, which operate in isolation of each other. An encompassing view of tools supporting the process of IS creation is missing to date. Therefore, to fill this gap, this study aims to develop a more comprehensive description of the landscape of IS tools by analyzing the associated approaches, roles, and contribution of existing tools. Through this understanding, the insights gained can be used to aid future development and advancement of tools for IS practitioners.

N2  - Abstract In this study, geographic information system (GIS)-based network analysis and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods were applied to the Erzincan?Trabzon segment of the Turkish high-speed railway (HSR) project. A new hybrid route, which considers both economic and environmental criteria, was created and compared with three different routes from various preconstruction studies. The route-generating analysis included the eight parameters (criteria) of slope, geology, soil quality, rivers, protected areas, roads, land cover, and lakes. The optimum route for connecting the port of Trabzon to Turkey's interior via HSR was generated. The weights for determining the route were tested for sensitivity. The study demonstrated the efficiency of GIS and AHP integration in generating optimum routes for HSR projects according to given databases. All these GIS and AHP analyses were applied automatically with our novel GIS extension for determining optimum HSR routes. The final route has preserved cultural and historical structures, environmental integrity. The new hybrid route also decreased construction costs by approximately 12%, and the least-cost-path analysis confirmed the environmental efficiency of the route.

N2  - Summary Policy-makers working at the interface of agri-food and public health often deal with complex and cross-cutting issues that have broad health impacts and socio-economic implications. They have a responsibility to ensure that policy-making based on these issues is accountable and informed by the best available scientific evidence. We conducted a qualitative descriptive study of agri-food public health policy-makers and research and policy analysts in Ontario, Canada, to understand their perspectives on how the policy-making process is currently informed by scientific evidence and how to facilitate this process. Five focus groups of 3?7 participants and five-one-to-one interviews were held in 2012 with participants from federal and provincial government departments and industry organizations in the agri-food public health sector. We conducted a thematic analysis of the focus group and interview transcripts to identify overarching themes. Participants indicated that the following six key principles are necessary to enable and demonstrate evidence-informed policy-making (EIPM) in this sector: (i) establish and clarify the policy objectives and context; (ii) support policy-making with credible scientific evidence from different sources; (iii) integrate scientific evidence with other diverse policy inputs (e.g. economics, local applicability and stakeholder interests); (iv) ensure that scientific evidence is communicated by research and policy stakeholders in relevant and user-friendly formats; (V) create and foster interdisciplinary relationships and networks across research and policy communities; and (VI) enhance organizational capacity and individual skills for EIPM. Ongoing and planned efforts in these areas, a supportive culture, and additional education and training in both research and policy realms are important to facilitate evidence-informed policy-making in this sector. Future research should explore these findings further in other countries and contexts.

N2  - Abstract Accounting for about 290,000?650,000 deaths across the globe, seasonal influenza is estimated by the World Health Organization to be a major cause of mortality. Hence, there is a need for a reliable and robust epidemiological surveillance decision-making system to understand and combat this epidemic disease. In a previous study, the authors proposed a decision support system to fight against seasonal influenza. This system is composed of three subsystems: (i) modeling and simulation, (ii) data warehousing, and (iii) analysis. The analysis subsystem relies on spatial online analytical processing (S-OLAP) technology. Although the S-OLAP technology is useful in analyzing multidimensional spatial data sets, it cannot take into account the inherent multicriteria nature of seasonal influenza risk assessment by itself. Therefore, the objective of this article is to extend the existing decision support system by adding advanced multicriteria analysis capabilities for enhanced seasonal influenza risk assessment and monitoring. Bearing in mind the characteristics of the decision problem considered in this article, a well-known multicriteria classification method, the dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA), was selected to boost the existing decision support system. Combining the S-OLAP technology and the multicriteria classification method DRSA in the same decision support system will largely improve and extend the scope of analysis capabilities. The extended decision support system has been validated by its application to assess seasonal influenza risk in the northwest region of Algeria.

N2  - Abstract This study aims to review the related literature on operations research (OR)/management science (MS) in the Arab world published during the last three decades. Owing to the nature of this study, an extensive survey of the related literature was conducted and inferences were drawn. The inferences drawn from the literature survey on OR/MS in the Arab world were first, there is a paucity of published real-world applications of OR/MS. Second, there is a lack of published survey-type studies in most Arab countries, except in Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates. Third, the majority of published works on OR/MS were of a conceptual nature. A few papers concerned with OR/MS in the Arab world were published during the 1980s, with a special emphasis on conceptual issues rather than on applied or survey-type studies. The 1990s witnessed an increased number of publications on both survey-type and conceptual studies. Since 2000, the number of publications has increased substantially, mainly through conceptual studies. This study has a number of implications for both practitioners and researchers. Practitioners will be made aware of the applications of OR/MS in the Arab world and the type of problems that have been addressed. This, in turn, might motivate the decision makers and the managers to adopt OR/MS approaches in solving their organizations' problems. As a result, this might increase the usage of OR/MS in this part of the world. Researchers will be able to identify the OR/MS research areas that need more attention in the Arab world. The study mainly covers the studies that are written in English and indexed in non-Arabic databases. Although the Arabic works were not surveyed exhaustively, the author reviewed and included some available OR/MS works written in Arabic. This study is considered as the first work of its type in surveying the scholarly publications pertaining to OR/MS in the Arab world since the 1980s.

N2  - Abstract The main feature of Pythagorean fuzzy sets is that it is characterized by five parameters, namely membership degree, nonmembership degree, hesitancy degree, strength of commitment about membership, and direction of commitment. In this paper, we first investigate four existing comparison methods for ranking Pythagorean fuzzy sets and point out by examples that the method proposed by Yager, which considers the influence fully of the five parameters, is more efficient than the other ones. Later, we propose a variety of distance measures for Pythagorean fuzzy sets and Pythagorean fuzzy numbers, which take into account the five parameters of Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Based on the proposed distance measures, we present some similarity measures of Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Furthermore, a multiple criteria Pythagorean fuzzy group decision-making approach is proposed. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the validity and applicability of the presented group decision-making method.

N2  - Abstract Probabilistic interval-valued hesitant fuzzy sets (PIV-HFSs) are suitable for aggregating information from different groups because the probabilistic information of all the groups can be included by using interval values. Moreover, decision makers (DMs) prefer to use interval values to provide evaluation information. Furthermore, the traditional multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) approach has some limitations, such as obtaining the DMs' weights with inappropriate methods and neglecting the interactions amongst the criteria and the psychological characteristics of DMs. Motivated by these research background, the main contents of this study are as follows. First, PIV-HFSs are proposed, and the convex combination operation is extended into PIV-HFSs. Second, a hybrid MCGDM approach with PIV-HFSs is suggested that is based on the maximizing deviation method, fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) and TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for interactive and multi-criteria decision-making model). Third, an evaluation case of health management centres based on the service-specific failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is considered. The results show that the most crucial secondary factor is frequency (0.35775) and that the most serious failure mode is the inaccurate check-in. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can evaluate service quality effectively and that it performs better than other methods.

Private-sector partner selection is a significant step to ensure the success of EVCI-PPP projects, but it has been rarely studied. This paper therefore identifies selection criteria for private partners in EVCI-PPP projects and assesses the alternatives using an extended multicriteria operation and compromise solution (VIKOR) method. A partner selection indicator system is established through three development processes, and the factors are categorized into five factor packages: basic ability, management ability, performance of previous performance and credit performance, performance of projects, and sustainable development. These factors include 22 subcriteria. An extended VIKOR-based method incorporating an intuitionistic fuzzy set is developed to select an optimal private partner. A case study is used to verify the effectiveness and rationalization of the proposed approach. Three potential candidates, P1, P2, P3, are evaluated and ranked according to their evaluation scores, and the results show that P1 is the best partner solution. Relevant charging infrastructure project experience, technical level in charging facilities, and financing plan are the top three criteria for choosing appropriate partners for EVCI-PPP projects. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for the government to select suitable private-sector partners to accelerate the sustainable development of charging facilities.

N2  - Summary Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has been accepted to overcome some weaknesses of the current Internet architecture, showing that ?what is being exchanged? is more important than ?who are exchanging information.? Given the inadequate considerations on Quality of Service (QoS) and energy saving in ICN routing, we propose in this paper a routing algorithm to enhance the two aspects. At first, on one hand, Cauchy distribution is used as a fuzzy model to evaluate users' QoS requirements, such as bandwidth, delay, and error rate; on the other hand, we formulate energy saving problem to evaluate the green quality of routing algorithm. Then, we design a link selection approach by considering QoS and energy saving, which belongs to a multi-objective decision problem resolved by intelligent drops algorithm. Finally, we implement the proposed algorithm and compare it with the famous adaptive forwarding mechanism in terms of some significant metrics, and the experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm is more efficient.

N2  - Summary The battery box is the structure that comprises the battery cells and its casing. It is designed to fix and protect the battery module. During the actual driving, there exists stress and resonance on a battery pack and its outer casing due to external vibration and shock. The safety of an electric vehicle largely depends on the mechanical characteristics of its battery pack. Besides, a lighter weight electric vehicle has a longer driving range, which makes it much more popular in vehicle market. In this paper, a comprehensive design procedure based on multi-objective optimization and experiments is applied to compare the maximum equivalent stress and resonance frequency on a battery pack casing with different materials (DC01 steel, aluminum 6061, copper C22000, and carbon nanotube [CNT]) under bumpy road, sharp turns, and sudden braking conditions to obtain the best material. Moreover, CNT is proved to be the best material considering all the performance standards. Response surface optimization design method is adopted to get an optimal design of the battery pack casing. Optimization results conclude that the maximum equivalent stress can be reduced from 3.9243 to 3.2363 MPa, and the six-order resonance frequency can be increased from 722.65 to 788.71 Hz. Experiments are carried to validate the mechanical performance of the optimal design; the deviation between the simulation and experimental results is within the tolerance.

N2  - Abstract Influence diagrams (IDs) are one of the most commonly used graphical and mathematical decision models for reasoning under uncertainty. In conventional IDs, both probabilities representing beliefs and utilities representing preferences of decision makers are precise point-valued parameters. However, it is usually difficult or even impossible to directly provide such parameters. In this paper, we extend conventional IDs to allow IDs with interval-valued parameters (IIDs) and develop a counterpart method of Copper's evaluation method to evaluate IIDs. IIDs avoid the difficulties attached to the specification of precise parameters and provide the capability to model decision-making processes in a situation that the precise parameters cannot be specified. The counterpart method to Copper's evaluation method reduces the evaluation of IIDs into inference problems of Bayesian networks with interval-valued probabilities. An algorithm based on the approximate inference of Bayesian networks with interval-valued probabilities is proposed, and extensive experiments are conducted. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can find the optimal strategies effectively in IIDs, and the interval-valued expected utilities obtained by proposed algorithm are contained in those obtained by exact evaluating algorithms. The newly development approach would significantly extend the range of IDs for managerial decision support applications where parameters of variables can be specifically defined by only estimated intervals.

N2  - Abstract Since its inception in 1965, the theory of fuzzy sets has advanced in a variety of ways and in many disciplines. Applications of this theory can be found, for example, in artificial intelligence, computer science, medicine, control engineering, decision theory, expert systems, logic, management science, operations research, pattern recognition, and robotics. Mathematical developments have advanced to a very high standard and are still forthcoming to day. In this review, the basic mathematical framework of fuzzy set theory will be described, as well as the most important applications of this theory to other theories and techniques. Since 1992 fuzzy set theory, the theory of neural nets and the area of evolutionary programming have become known under the name of ?computational intelligence? or ?soft computing?. The relationship between these areas has naturally become particularly close. In this review, however, we will focus primarily on fuzzy set theory. Applications of fuzzy set theory to real problems are abound. Some references will be given. To describe even a part of them would certainly exceed the scope of this review.

N2  - Abstract Participatory methods and community-based approaches have an important role to play in combating land degradation. This paper follows a well-defined participatory framework to identify key stakeholders and to select Sustainable Land Management approaches for reducing soil erosion and land degradation in the Troodos Mountains of Cyprus. Among the options suggested and evaluated by stakeholders, terrace rehabilitation had the best overall performance, followed by crop diversification and afforestation. Stakeholders agreed that the rehabilitation of dry-stone terraces was the preferred option, as it is a practice with high environmental benefits and fits well in the local socio-cultural context, despite the higher cost compared to other options. In the first year of implementing the approach, three mountain communities co-organised hands-on terrace maintenance events, engaging more than 160 people in rehabilitation activities. The community-based approach has sparked the interest of people within and beyond the research site, and another series of events is scheduled for the coming season. This outcome indicates that social innovations can benefit from the integration of local and scientific knowledge, while participatory process can enhance the self-confidence and organisational structures of local communities. Sustaining and enhancing the impact of the approach in the long-run require developing local terrace maintenance institutions, actively engaging the youth in terrace management and improving the profitability of mountain farming through the differentiation of local products.

N2  - Abstract With increasing societal demands for food security and environmental sustainability on land, the question arises: to what extent do synergies and trade-offs exist between soil functions and how can they be measured across Europe? To address this challenge, we followed the functional land management approach and assessed five soil functions: primary productivity, water regulation and purification, climate regulation, soil biodiversity and nutrient cycling. Soil, management and climate data were collected from 94 sites covering 13 countries, five climatic zones and two land-use types (arable and grassland). This dataset was analysed using the Soil Navigator, a multicriteria decision support system developed to assess the supply of the five soil functions simultaneously. Most sites scored high for two to three soil functions, demonstrating that managing for multifunctionality in soil is possible but that local constraints and trade-offs do exist. Nutrient cycling, biodiversity and climate regulation were less frequently delivered at high capacity than the other two soil functions. Using correlation and co-occurrence analyses, we also found that synergies and trade-offs between soil functions vary among climatic zones and land-use types. This study provides a new framework for monitoring soil quality at the European scale where both the supply of soil functions and their interactions are considered. Highlights Managing and monitoring soil multifunctionality across Europe is possible. Synergies and trade-offs between soil functions exist, making it difficult to maximize the supply of all five soil functions simultaneously. Synergies and trade-offs between soil functions vary by climatic zone and land-use type. Climate regulation, biodiversity and nutrient cycling are less frequently delivered at high capacity.
