N2  - This research suggests an approach constructed on the connotation of plithogenic theory and VIKOR (VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) technique to come up with a methodical procedure to assess the infirmary serving under a framework of plithogenic theory, where the ambiguity, incomplete information, qualitative information, approximate evaluation, imprecision and uncertainty are addressed with semantic expressions determined by plithogenic numbers and computing of contradiction degrees of attribute values. This research stratifies the plithogenic multi criteria decision making (MCDM) strategy for defining the significant weights of assessing standards, and the VIKOR technique is applied for enhancing the serving efficiency classifications of the possible substitutes. An experimental issue, including 11 assessing standards, 3 private and 2 general hospitals in Zagazig, has been evaluated by 3 assessors from several areas of medical activities, asked to validate the suggested strategy. In this research, we give some definitions of the plithogenic environment, which is more general and comprehensive than fuzzy, intuitionistic fuzzy and neutrosophic ones. The plithogeny is interested in the contradiction degrees between attribute values that help in better calculating the aggregations. We conducted the data analysis and the results showed us that the serving efficiency of private medical centers is superior than that of general medical centers due to the fact that public medical centers are scarcely supported by governmental institutions. The private medical centers have to ward themselves to keep possession of bringing patients or attract patients. We conducted the sensitivity analysis of the achieved results, to verify their validity, and to find out to what extent the different values affect the ranking of available alternatives.

N2  - Developments in the internet of things technology (IoT) have greatly influenced the way we live and have been seen in a variety of application areas, including health care. Most of the papers reviewed dealt with some health care services, and there is little scientific literature on the application or implementation of IoT in cancer detection and treatment services. This encouraged us to (re) evaluate the provision of health-care services and their location to harness the benefits associated with the use of IoT. Also, the lateness which caused by transmitting data to the cloud and back to the application is inadmissible for healthcare systems which based on IoT. As well, it is not efficient to transmit so much data to the cloud for processing and storage, because it would saturate network bandwidth and not be scalable. This also encouraged us to use fog computing which take advantages of cloud resources and coordinate the utilization of geographically distributed edge devices. So, this paper proposes the implementation of healthcare system which based on IoT and fog computing technologies for averting the spread of cancer via early detection, evaluation of disease’s symptoms, and also analyzing health data that gathered from IoT through various sensor networks and other smart devices to help healthcare professionals to turn a stream of data into actionable insights and evidence-based healthcare decision-making to improve and enhance cancer treatment. Due to the similarity of the general symptoms of cancer with some other diseases , we also proposed a neutrosophic multi-criteria decision making technique for assisting healthcare professionals to predict disease that patient may be suffers from if he/she does not have cancer. This technique depends on gathered data from proposed healthcare system and able to handle uncertainty of imprecision and ambiguity which resulted from the proportional priority scales of different symptoms of disease.

N2  - Background Sleep plays an essential role in repairing and healing human mental and physical health. Developing an efficient method for scoring electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep stages is expected to help medical specialists in the early diagnosis of sleep disorders. Method In this paper, a novel technique is proposed for classifying sleep stages EEG signals using correlation graphs. First, each 30 s EEG segment is divided into a set of sub-segments. The dimensionality of each sub-segment is reduced by using a statistical model. Second, each EEG segment is transferred into a graph considering each sub-segment as a node in a graph, and a link between each pair of nodes is calculated based on their correlation coefficient. Graph's modularity is used as input features into an ensemble classifier. Results Different community detection algorithm based correlation graph are investigated to discern the most effective features to reveal the differences between EEG sleep stages. A combination of various classification techniques: a least square vector machine (LS-SVM), k-means, Naïve Bayes, Fuzzy C-means, k-nearest, and logistic regression are tested using multi criteria decision making (MCDM) to design an ensemble classifier. Based on the results of the MCDM, the best four: LS-SVM, Naïve Bayes, logistic regression and k-nearest are integrated, to finally utilise as an ensemble classifier to categorise the graph's characteristics. The results obtained from the ensemble classifier are compared with those from the individual classifiers. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state of the art of sleep stages classification. The experimental results showed that the EEG sleep classification based on correlation graphs are able to achieve better recognition results than the existing state of the art techniques.

N2  - Best Worst Method (BWM) has recently been proposed as a method for Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). Studies show that BWM compared with other methods such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), leads to lower inconsistency of the results while reducing the number of required pairwise comparisons. MCDM methods such as BWM require accurate information. However, it often happens in practice that a level of uncertainty accompanies the information. The main aim of this paper is to address this problem and provide an integration of BWM and Z-numbers, namely ZBWM. Providing BWM with Z-numbers enables the BWM method to handle the uncertainty of information of a multi-criteria decision. Additionally, the capabilities of the proposed method in the process of utilizing the linguistic information dealing with big data are highlighted. The proposed method is examined to address a supplier development problem. By experimental results, we show that ZBWM results lower inconsistency when compared with BWM. A Z-number contains subjectivity in its fuzzy part, which can be addressed in future applications of ZBWM.

N2  - Utilizing multi-criteria decision analysis as an alternative to traditional screening processes for GIS modeling for landfill site selection (LSS) has attracted significant interest in recent years because of its time and cost savings and its ability to achieve better validation and accuracy. This paper surveys the developments in the modeling of LSS using geographic information systems (GIS) on the basis of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in the past two decades from 1997 to 2014. Emphasis is placed on the third and fifth stages of the overall applied methodology (selection of weights and decision rules), as well as on the efficiency of the LSS models. From the review, the strengths and limitations of using MCDA for LSS modeling via GIS are identified. Moreover, artificial neural networks instead of MCDA can be used as a new approach in the third and fifth stages of LSS models to enhance validation and accuracy.

N2  - Forestry science has a long tradition of studying the relationship between stand productivity and abiotic and biotic site characteristics, such as climate, topography, soil and vegetation. Many of the early site quality modelling studies related site index to environmental variables using basic statistical methods such as linear regression. Because most ecological variables show a typical non-linear course and a non-constant variance distribution, a large fraction of the variation remained unexplained by these linear models. More recently, the development of more advanced non-parametric and machine learning methods provided opportunities to overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, these methods also have drawbacks. Due to their increasing complexity they are not only more difficult to implement and interpret, but also more vulnerable to overfitting. Especially in a context of regionalisation, this may prove to be problematic. Although many non-parametric and machine learning methods are increasingly used in applications related to forest site quality assessment, their predictive performance has only been assessed for a limited number of methods and ecosystems. In this study, five different modelling techniques are compared and evaluated, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), generalized additive models (GAM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Each method is used to model site index of homogeneous stands of three important tree species of the Taurus Mountains (Turkey): Pinus brutia, Pinus nigra and Cedrus libani. Site index is related to soil, vegetation and topographical variables, which are available for 167 sample plots covering all important environmental gradients in the research area. The five techniques are compared in a multi-criteria decision analysis in which different model performance measures, ecological interpretability and user-friendliness are considered as criteria. When combining these criteria, in most cases GAM is found to outperform all other techniques for modelling site index for the three species. BRT is a good alternative in case the ecological interpretability of the technique is of higher importance. When user-friendliness is more important MLR and CART are the preferred alternatives. Despite its good predictive performance, ANN is penalized for its complex, non-transparent models and big training effort.

N2  - We present a method to learn the criteria weights in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) by applying emerging learning-to-rank machine learning techniques. Given the pairwise preferences by a decision maker (DM), we learn the weights that the DM attaches to the multiple criteria, characterizing each alternative. As the training information, our method requires the pairwise preferences of alternatives, as revealed by the DM. Once, the DM’s decision model is learnt in terms of the criteria weights, it can be applied to predict his choices for any new set of alternatives. The empirical validation of the proposed approach is done on a collection of 12 standard datasets. The accuracy values are compared with those obtained for the state-of-the-art methods such as ranking-SVM and TOPSIS.

N2  - Abstract. Travelers can enjoy a wide range of choices with the assistance of online review websites such as TripAdvisor. Online reviews provided by customers are an important portion of hotels' online business worldwide as they have value in terms of understanding customers' observations of hotels' product and service features. Hotel managers seek to understand travelers' satisfaction and hotel preferences through online reviews to improve their marketing strategy and decision making. This research uses the travelers' generated content in online hotel reviews to provide reasonable and benchmarking understandings about customers' satisfaction and preferences. Hence, the aim of this study is identifying the important factors for hotel selection based on previous travelers' reviews on TripAdvisor. Accordingly, we develop a new method for the use of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) and soft computing approaches. Concentrating on the case study of the Canary Islands hotels, we show how this method can be applied to determine the satisfaction and preferences among travelers that impact their decision in hotel choices. The results help to identify four customer segments for Canary Islands hotels. These segments are “Highly Satisfied Travelers”, “Satisfied Travelers”, “Moderately Satisfied Travelers”, and “Unsatisfied Travelers”, showing that different travelers have various degrees of satisfaction with dissimilar preferences. We found that travelers' preference and satisfaction segmentation is a crucial stage in travelers' behavior analysis to improve the quality of hotels' products and services. This form of analysis can enhance hotel managers' understanding of different market segments according to customers’ satisfaction level and their preferences. The findings of this study will help managers to set priority instructions for improving the corresponding hotel features and use online customer reviews to improve customer satisfaction and hotel performance.

N2  - Combining wind power with pumped-storage systems is trustworthy for reducing the unreliability of wind energy, caused by the variable nature of the wind for contributing to the grid's peak shaving. Locating suitable sites for constructing both wind parks and pumped-storage systems for peak shaving is a delicate problem-solving. For solving such problems, a wide range of technical, financial, and environmental criteria should be taken into account. A two-step decision framework combining GIS, Analytic Network Process (ANP) and fuzzy VIKOR are proposed in this paper to solve the problem for locating the suitable sites for constructing a wind-powered pump storage plant. In the first step, a GIS database is developed to locate a handful potential sites within the study area. As there are different and even conflicting criteria involved with site selection problem. In the second step, we used an MCDM approach of fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) and fuzzy VIKOR to rank these potential sites. To establish an evaluation system, four major clusters of criteria are introduced (wind farm, water reservoir, water pump and power production) with more addition related sub-criteria. Comprehensive guidelines are formulated through a hierarchical procedure so a data-driven, multi-aspect decision framework could be presented with the goal of improving the benefits of integrated renewable energies. The results show that, the Gilane-Gharb dam is the most promising site within the study area. This site provides a net area of 13.2 km2 for constructing a wind farm with an approximate power capacity of 31 MW. The proposed procedure in this is a framework that are provide a theoretical reference for resolving any multicriteria decision-making problem by introducing the appropriate criteria.

N2  - Abstract The objectives of this paper are (1) to propose new techniques to learn and improve the multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) method PROAFTN based on machine learning approaches and (2) to compare the performance of the developed methods with other well-known machine learning classification algorithms. The proposed learning methods consist of two stages: The first stage involves using the discretization techniques to obtain the required parameters for the PROAFTN method, and the second stage is the development of a new inductive approach to construct PROAFTN prototypes for classification. The comparative study is based on the generated classification accuracy of the algorithms on the data sets. For further robust analysis of the experiments, we used the Friedman statistical measure with the corresponding post hoc tests. The proposed approaches significantly improved the performance of the classification method PROAFTN. Based on the generated results on the same data sets, PROAFTN outperforms widely used classification algorithms. Furthermore, the method is simple, no preprocessing is required, and no loss of information during learning. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Context People who have recently recovered from the threat of deteriorating coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have antibodies to the coronavirus circulating in their blood. Thus, the transfusion of these antibodies to deteriorating patients could theoretically help boost their immune system. Biologically, two challenges need to be surmounted to allow convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue the most severe COVID-19 patients. First, convalescent subjects must meet donor selection plasma criteria and comply with national health requirements and known standard routine procedures. Second, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems should be considered in the selection of the most suitable CP and the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19. Objective This paper presents a rescue framework for the transfusion of the best CP to the most critical patients with COVID-19 on the basis of biological requirements by using machine learning and novel MCDM methods. Method The proposed framework is illustrated on the basis of two distinct and consecutive phases (i.e. testing and development). In testing, ABO compatibility is assessed after classifying donors into the four blood types, namely, A, B, AB and O, to indicate the suitability and safety of plasma for administration in order to refine the CP tested list repository. The development phase includes patient and donor sides. In the patient side, prioritisation is performed using a contracted patient decision matrix constructed between ‘serological/protein biomarkers and the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fractional inspired oxygen criteria’ and ‘patient list based on novel MCDM method known as subjective and objective decision by opinion score method’. Then, the patients with the most urgent need are classified into the four blood types and matched with a tested CP list from the test phase in the donor side. Thereafter, the prioritisation of CP tested list is performed using the contracted CP decision matrix. Result An intelligence-integrated concept is proposed to identify the most appropriate CP for corresponding prioritised patients with COVID-19 to help doctors hasten treatments. Discussion The proposed framework implies the benefits of providing effective care and prevention of the extremely rapidly spreading COVID-19 from affecting patients and the medical sector.

N2  - Objective Manual evaluation of machine learning algorithms and selection of a suitable classifier from the list of available candidate classifiers, is highly time consuming and challenging task. If the selection is not carefully and accurately done, the resulting classification model will not be able to produce the expected performance results. In this study, we present an accurate multi-criteria decision making methodology (AMD) which empirically evaluates and ranks classifiers’ and allow end users or experts to choose the top ranked classifier for their applications to learn and build classification models for them. Methods and material Existing classifiers performance analysis and recommendation methodologies lack (a) appropriate method for suitable evaluation criteria selection, (b) relative consistent weighting mechanism, (c) fitness assessment of the classifiers’ performances, and (d) satisfaction of various constraints during the analysis process. To assist machine learning practitioners in the selection of suitable classifier(s), AMD methodology is proposed that presents an expert group-based criteria selection method, relative consistent weighting scheme, a new ranking method, called optimum performance ranking criteria, based on multiple evaluation metrics, statistical significance and fitness assessment functions, and implicit and explicit constraints satisfaction at the time of analysis. For ranking the classifiers performance, the proposed ranking method integrates Wgt.Avg.F-score, CPUTimeTesting, CPUTimeTraining, and Consistency measures using the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The final relative closeness score produced by TOPSIS, is ranked and the practitioners select the best performance (top-ranked) classifier for their problems in-hand. Findings Based on the extensive experiments performed on 15 publically available UCI and OpenML datasets using 35 classification algorithms from heterogeneous families of classifiers, an average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.98 is observed. Similarly, the AMD method has showed improved performance of 0.98 average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient as compared to 0.83 and 0.045 correlation coefficient of the state-of-the-art ranking methods, performance of algorithms (PAlg) and adjusted ratio of ratio (ARR). Conclusion and implication The evaluation, empirical analysis of results and comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the feasibility of AMD methodology, especially the selection and weighting of right evaluation criteria, accurate ranking and selection of optimum performance classifier(s) for the user's application's data in hand. AMD reduces expert's time and efforts and improves system performance by designing suitable classifier recommended by AMD methodology.

N2  - Flood is a devastating natural hazard that may cause damage to the environment infrastructure, and society. Hence, identifying the susceptible areas to flood is an important task for every country to prevent such dangerous consequences. The present study developed a framework for identifying flood-prone areas of the Topľa river basin, Slovakia using geographic information system (GIS), multi-criteria decision making approach (MCDMA), bivariate statistics (Frequency Ratio (FR), Statistical Index (SI)) and machine learning (Naïve Bayes Tree (NBT), Logistic Regression (LR)). To reach such a goal, different physical-geographical factors (criteria) were integrated and mapped. To access the relationship and interdependences among the criteria, decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP) were used. Based on the experts’ decisions, the DEMATEL-ANP model was used to compute the relative weights of different criteria and a GIS-based linear combination was performed to derive the susceptibility index. Separately, the flood susceptibility index computation through NBT-FR and NBT-SI hybrid models assumed, in the first stage, the estimation of the weight of each class/category of conditioning factor through SI and FR and the integration of these values in NBT algorithm. The application of LR stand-alone required the calculation of the weights of conditioning factors by analysing their spatial relation with the location of the historical flood events. The study revealed that very high and high flood susceptibility classes covered between 20% and 47% of the study area, respectively. The validation of results, using the past flood points, highlighted that the hybrid DEMATEL-ANP model was the most performant with an Area Under ROC curve higher than 0.97, an accuracy of 0.922 and a value of HSS of 0.844. The presented methodological approach used for the identification of flood susceptible areas can serve as an alternative for the updating of preliminary flood risk assessment based on the EU Floods Directive.

N2  - The main focus of this paper is to present thermodynamic and economic analyses and multi-objective optimization of a novel geothermal-solar multigeneration system. The system aims to produce hydrogen, freshwater, electricity, cooling load, and hot water and designed based on geothermal and solar energy. After modeling and thermodynamic and economic analysis, exergy destruction rate, exergy efficiency and, cost rate were calculated for each component of the system. The results showed that the highest amount of exergy destruction was related to parabolic trough collectors (PTCs) and absorption chillers. To select the geothermal fluid of the organic Rankine cycle (ORC), several different fluids were investigated, among which isobutene was selected. By using the Group method of data handling (GMDH) neural network, a mathematical relationship was obtained between the inputs and outputs of the problem and were given as inputs to the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII)alg. The final optimal point was obtained applying the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) decision criterion at which the exergy efficiency and cost rate were calculated to be 21.63% and 63.89 $/h, respectively. The meteorological data of the Zanjan, Isfahan, and Bandar Abbas cities were used to calculate the performance accurately at the TOPSIS selection point. To provide a comparison between different cities, the performance of the system was evaluated on September 17 as a sample day. On this day, the proposed system produces 26.38 kg of hydrogen and 373.8 m3 of freshwater in Isfahan.

N2  - In the last few years, machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to solve engineering problems. However, owing to certain complexities found in real-world problems, such as class imbalance, classical learning algorithms may not reach a prescribed performance. There can be situations where a good result on different conflicting objectives is desirable, such as true positive and true negative ratios, or it is important to balance model’s complexity and prediction score. To solve such issues, the application of multi-objective optimization design procedures can be used to analyze various trade-offs and build more robust machine learning models. Thus, the creation of ensembles of predictive models using such procedures is addressed in this work. First, a set of diverse predictive models is built by employing a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Next, a second multi-objective optimization step selects the previous models as ensemble members, resulting on several non-dominated solutions. A final multi-criteria decision making stage is applied to rank and visualize the resulting ensembles. To analyze the proposed methodology, two different experiments are conducted for binary classification. The first case study is a famous classification problem through which the proposed procedure is illustrated. The second one is a challenging real-world problem related to water quality monitoring, where the proposed procedure is compared to four classical ensemble learning algorithms. Results on this second experiment show that the proposed technique is able to create robust ensembles that can outperform other ensemble methods. Overall, the authors conclude that the proposed methodology for ensemble generation creates competitive models for real-world engineering problems.

N2  - Within unmanned aerial vehicles on-going research topics, automatic target recognition is acquiring relevance. This is due to the easiness with which it is possible to acquire such devices. In order to do this, signal processing and classification techniques could be adopted. Also, in order to improve the classification ratio, optimization techniques could be used. This subject is object of study for many researchers, but the authors worry about the lack of information while using single-objective optimization techniques. The proposed work comprises the application of multi-objective optimization design in order to create an automatic target recognition system to discriminate different types of unmanned aerial vehicles. In order to accomplish this, a K-band radar system is used to send and receive electromagnetic signals, which are then processed with feature extraction techniques, and finally, applied on an artificial neural network system. In order to improve the system’s classification ratio, the classifier is defined as a multi-objective problem, and evolutionary multi-objective optimization techniques are applied. Finally, in order to select the best possible trade-off, the level diagrams multi-criteria decision making methodology is used to compare different solutions.

N2  - Artisanal and small-scale mining is one of the global phenomena that is a threat to environmental health and safety. There are ambiguities in the manner in which an ore-processing facility operates. These ambiguities can cause environmental problems and hinder the mining capacity of these miners in Ghana. The vast majority of attempts to address these problems through the establishments of centralised processing centres have failed, with only a handful of successes. This research sought to use an established data-driven, geographic information based system to locate a centralised gold processing facility within the Wassa Amenfi-Prestea Mining Area in the Western region of Ghana. The study was designed to first determine the relevant factors that should be considered in the decision-making process for locating a centralised ore-processing facility. Secondly, it sought to implement the identified factors in a case study by identifying specific geospatial techniques that can best be applied to identify potential sites. By adopting in-depth consultations with four stakeholder groups for data collection and content analysis for data analysis, thirteen relevant factors were identified. However, in the case study, due to data unavailability, only seven of the factors were considered. Geoprocessing techniques including buffering and overlay analysis and multi-criteria decision analysis were employed to develop a model to identify the most preferred locations to site a centralised processing facility. Site characterisations and environmental considerations, incorporating identified constraints, to determine an appropriate location were selected. The final map output indicates estimated potential sites identified for the establishment of a centralised processing centre. The results obtained provide areas suitable for consideration.

N2  - A large number of journals and special volumes are publishing research concerned with sustainable supply chain (SSC). The importance of this the topic has significantly grown over time thus receiving increased attention from academics and practitioners in this area. This research critically analyzes the content of 286 papers published in different journals in the area over the span of fifteen years (2002–2016). The reviewed literature was structured using the following categories: year, journal, research methodology, research design, operation research (OR)/mathematical tools and techniques, data analysis technique, industry sector, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), authors, universities, country, enablers, and barriers. This enabled crucial gaps in knowledge of SSC to be identified allowing future research opportunities in the field to be determined. The major finding indicates that the research field is being dominated by the qualitative study. Also, of the quantitatively based studies that appeared in the literature, linear programming problem is the most often used solution approach to optimize the complex sustainable supply chain management problems. Drawn results show that there is enough scope to expand the research field and several opportunities still exist which needs to be investigated such as quantitative modeling, use of advance techniques and development of efficient algorithms.

N2  - Gully erosion is considered as a severe environmental problem in many areas of the world which causes huge damages to agricultural lands and infrastructures (i.e. roads, buildings, and bridges); however, gully erosion modeling and prediction with high accuracy are still difficult due to the complex interactions of various factors. The objective of this research was to develop and introduce three new ensemble models, which were based on Complex Proportional Assessment of Alternatives (COPRAS), Logistic Regression (LR), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Random Forest (RF), and Frequency Ratio (FR) for spatial prediction of gully erosion with a case study at the Najafabad watershed (Iran). For this purpose, a total of 290 head-cut of gullies and 17 conditioning factors were collected and used to establish a geospatial database. Subsequently, FR was used to determine the spatial relationship between the conditioning factors and the head-cut of gullies, whereas RF, BRT, and LR were used to quantify the relative importance of these factors. In the next step, three ensemble gully erosion models, named COPRAS-FR-RF, COPRAS-FR-BRT, and COPRAS-FR-LR were developed and verified. The Success Rate Curve (SRC), and the Prediction Rate Curve (PRC) and their areas under the curves (AUC) were used to check the performance of the three proposed models. The result showed that Soil group, geomorphology, and drainage density factors played the key role on the occurrence of the gully erosion. All the three models have very high degree-of-fit and the prediction performance, the COPRAS-FR-RF model (AUC-SRC = 0.974 and AUC-PRC = 0.929), the COPRAS-FR-BRT model (AUC-SRC = 0.973 and AUC-PRC = 0.928), and the COPRAS-FR-LR model (AUC-SRC = 0.972 and AUC-PRC = 0.926); therefore, it is concluded that they are efficient and new powerful tools which could be used for predicting gully erosion in prone-areas.

N2  - The rapid growth of new computing paradigms such as Cloud Computing and Big Data has unleashed great opportunities for companies to shift their business model towards a fully digital strategy. A major obstacle in this matter is the requirement of highly specialized ICT infrastructures that are expensive and difficult to manage. It is at this point that the IaaS (infrastructure as a service) model offers an efficient and cost-affordable solution to supply companies with their required computing resources. In the Big Data context, it is often a hard task to design an optimal IaaS solution that meets user requirements. In this context, we propose a methodology to optimize the definition of IaaS cloud models for hosting Big Data platforms, following a threefold criterion: cost, reliability, and computing capacity. Specifically, the proposed methodology hinges on evolutionary heuristics in order to find IaaS configurations in the cloud that optimally balance such objectives. We also define measures to quantify the aforementioned metrics over a Big Data platform hosted within an IaaS cloud model. The proposed method is validated by using real information from three IaaS providers and three Big Data platforms. The obtained results provide an insightful input for system managers when initially designing cloud infrastructures for Big Data applications.

N2  - Abstract Soil and its ecosystem functions play a societal role in securing sustainable food production while safeguarding natural resources. A functional land management framework has been proposed to optimize the agro-environmental outputs from the land and specifically the supply and demand of soil functions such as (a) primary productivity, (b) carbon sequestration, (c) water purification and regulation, (d) biodiversity and (e) nutrient cycling, for which soil knowledge is essential. From the outset, the LANDMARK multi-actor research project integrates harvested knowledge from local, national and European stakeholders to develop such guidelines, creating a sense of ownership, trust and reciprocity of the outcomes. About 470 stakeholders from five European countries participated in 32 structured workshops covering multiple land uses in six climatic zones. The harmonized results include stakeholders? priorities and concerns, perceptions on soil quality and functions, implementation of tools, management techniques, indicators and monitoring, activities and policies, knowledge gaps and ideas. Multi-criteria decision analysis was used for data analysis. Two qualitative models were developed using Decision EXpert methodology to evaluate ?knowledge? and ?needs?. Soil quality perceptions differed across workshops, depending on the stakeholder level and regionally established terminologies. Stakeholders had good inherent knowledge about soil functioning, but several gaps were identified. In terms of critical requirements, stakeholders defined high technical, activity and policy needs in (a) financial incentives, (b) credible information on improving more sustainable management practices, (c) locally relevant advice, (d) farmers? discussion groups, (e) training programmes, (f) funding for applied research and monitoring, and (g) strengthening soil science in education.

N2  - This paper presents an efficiency assessment of African airlines, using the TOPSIS – Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution. TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision making technique, which similar to DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis), ranks a finite set of units based on the minimisation of distance from an ideal point, and the maximisation of distance from an anti-ideal point. In this research, TOPSIS is used first in a two-stage approach, in order to assess the relative efficiency of African airlines using the most frequent indicators adopted by the literature on airlines. During the second stage, neural networks are combined with TOPSIS results, as part of an attempt to produce a model for airline performance which has effective predictive ability. The results reveal that network size-related variables – economies of scope, are the most important variables for explaining levels of efficiency in the African airline industry, although the impact of fleet mix and public ownership cannot be neglected.

N2  - The wide spread of internet resources has emerged new paradigms of learning and knowledge delivery to facilitate and enhance learning particularly in e-learning systems. The important milestones of these new paradigms are known as digital learning objects (DLO) which are smallest packed bits for learning. The abundance of these DLOs raises an important question on how to select effectively high quality reusable learning objects. There exist many soft computing approaches such as; fuzzy computing, neural networks, evolutionary computing, support vector machines, machine learning and probabilistic reasoning. In this paper, fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods in choosing suitable DLOs were reviewed. This paper discusses recent variety of soft computing methods used in selecting and evaluating digital learning objects through multi criteria decision analysis approaches used; for selecting metrics like basic topical, course similarity, internal topical, basic and user similarity personal, and context similarity situational relevance and for evaluation; scalarization method, employing triangular, trapezoidal and distance based similarity (adapted from TOPSIS techniques). As DLOs continue to evolve it is inevitable to utilize multi-criteria techniques for selecting and or improving quality. The abundance of DLOs has increased the need for applying practical soft computing techniques to retrieve high quality, reusable DLOs.

N2  - Objective Motivated by the well documented worldwide spread of adverse drug events, as well as the increased danger of antibiotic resistance (caused mainly by inappropriate prescribing and overuse), we propose a novel recommendation system for antibiotic prescription (PARS). Method Our approach is based on the combination of semantic technologies with MCDA (Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding) that allowed us to build a two level decision support model. Given a specific domain, the approach assesses the adequacy of an alternative/action (prescription of antibiotic) for a specific subject (patient) with an issue (bacterial infection) in a given context (medical). The goal of the first level of the decision support model is to select the set of alternatives which have the potential to be suitable. Then the second level sorts the alternatives into categories according to their adequacy using an MCDA sorting method (MR–Sort with Veto) and a structured set of description logic queries. Results We applied this approach in the domain of antibiotic prescriptions, working closely with the EpiCura Hospital Center (BE). Its performance was compared to the EpiCura recommendation guidelines which are currently in use. The results showed that the proposed system is more consistent in its recommendations when compared with the static EpiCura guidelines. Moreover, with PARS the antibiotic prescribing workflow becomes more flexible. PARS allows the user (physician) to update incrementally and dynamically a patient’s profile with more information, or to input knowledge modifications that accommodate the decision context (like the introduction of new side effects and antibiotics, the development of germs that are resistant, etc). At the end of our evaluation, we detail a number of limitations of the current version of PARS and discuss future perspectives.

N2  - Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy is administered intravenously during the treatment of breast cancer. Prior to surgery, doctors recommend chemotherapy to shrink the large size of an invasive tumor. This research work proposes a Deux Machine Learning framework, implementing a double ensemble of Machine Learning algorithms for building an optimized and efficient solution to predict a complete pathological response of patients after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy. Unlike algorithms which focus on the accuracy of prediction, the performance of the Deux Machine Learning framework is measured using a multi criteria decision-making technique known as weighted simple additive weighting (WSAW). The WSAW comprehensive performance score is calculated by considering ten evaluation metrics, namely, Accuracy, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, TP Rate, FP Rate, Precision, Recall, F-Measure, MCC, and ROC. The results are validated using the k-fold cross validation technique, achieving an accuracy of 99.08%. When the performance of the proposed framework is compared with the performance of state-of-the-art classifiers such as SVM and random forest, the results are quite promising. With the growing trend of the applications of Artificial Intelligence in Cancer research, Machine Learning has an important future in prognostication and decision-making.

N2  - A new reaction rate system was introduced for differential kinetic simultaneous determination of hydroquinone (HQ) and Catechol (CC). The method is based on the different kinetic behavior of HQ and CC in their reaction with iron (III) in the presence of 1, 10-phenanthroline (Phen) as a chromogenic reagent. An asymmetric double line flow injection manifold coupled with a spectrophotometric detector was designed and optimized using TOPSIS (Technique of ranking Preferences by Similarity to the Ideal Solution) methods based upon AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process). Under optimal conditions, Bayesian Regularized Artificial Neural Network (BR-ANN) trained by back-propagation of errors was utilized as a non-linear model calibration of flow injection manifold. Detection limits of 0.05 and 0.07 mg L−1 were obtained for HQ and CC, respectively. The linear dynamic range was 0.5–3.0 mg L−1 for both analytes. The suggested method was applied for simultaneous determination of HQ and CC in real samples.

N2  - This study proposes a novel decision support system for product ranking problems which integrates multi criteria decision making (MCDM) and aspect level sentiment analysis techniques. The main purpose of the developed methodology is to rank the alternative products taking into account a set of product criteria and the customer comments related to these criteria posted on websites to recommend the most appropriate alternative to potential customers. The decision support system comprises two stages, in the first stage, the online customer reviews are transformed into customer satisfaction scores through aspect level sentiment analysis to obtain performance scores corresponding to alternative products, whereas the second stage deals with ranking the alternative products via a novel MCDM methodology, namely “IF-ELECTRE integrated with VIKOR” according to the performance scores obtained in the first level. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) are utilized to effectively represent the customer reviews including hesitant expressions in decision matrix. The weights of criteria (the product aspects of significant importance for customers) are determined using entropy method. The applicability of the developed approach is explored by a case study, in which customer reviews about hotel experiences are evaluated using lexicon based sentiment analysis and alternative hotels are ranked according to the findings from the sentiment analysis by the Intuitionistic fuzzy (IF)-ELECTRE integrated with VIKOR methodology.

N2  - In this paper, an approach to decision making is described. It combines a knowledge acquisition technique, a multi-attribute decision making technique, a validation technique and a machine learning algorithm. The suggested system is an extension of a previous decision support system based on the fuzzy repertory table technique. The aim is to increase its efficiency when dealing with a great amount of alternatives and criteria. The solution is based on a mechanism to divide the original problem into several simpler sub-problems. Moreover, a case study is presented to illustrate how the proposed system is used to design a Product Search Assistant. It will be integrated into a multi-agent architecture developed to give support to an e-marketplace.

N2  - Economic, social and environmental requirements make planning for a sustainable electricity generation mix a demanding endeavour. Technological innovation offers a range of renewable generation and energy management options which require fine tuning and accurate control to be successful, which calls for the use of large-scale, detailed datasets. In this paper, we focus on the UK and use Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to evaluate electricity generation options against technical, environmental and social criteria. Data incompleteness and redundancy, usual in large-scale datasets, as well as expert opinion ambiguity are dealt with using a comprehensive grey TOPSIS model. We used evaluation scores to develop a multi-objective optimization model to maximize the technical, environmental and social utility of the electricity generation mix and to enable a larger role for innovative technologies. Demand uncertainty was handled with an interval range and we developed our problem with multi-objective grey linear programming (MOGLP). Solving the mathematical model provided us with the electricity generation mix for every 5 min of the period under study. Our results indicate that nuclear and renewable energy options, specifically wind, solar, and hydro, but not biomass energy, perform better against all criteria indicating that interindustry architectural innovation in the power generation mix is key to sustainable UK electricity production and supply.

N2  - Risk and return are interdependent in a stock portfolio. To achieve the anticipated return, comparative risk should be considered simultaneously. However, complex investment environments and dynamic change in decision making criteria complicate forecasts of risk and return for various investment objects. Additionally, investors often fail to maximize their profits because of improper capital allocation. Although stock investment involves multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), traditional MCDM theory has two shortfalls: first, it is inappropriate for decisions that evolve with a changing environment; second, weight assignments for various criteria are often oversimplified and inconsistent with actual human thinking processes. In 1965, Rechenberg proposed evolution strategies for solving optimization problems involving real number parameters and addressed several flaws in traditional algorithms, such as their use of point search only and their high probability of falling into optimal solution area. In 1992, Hillis introduced the co-evolutionary concept that the evolution of living creatures is interactive with their environments (multi-criteria) and constantly improves the survivability of their genes, which then expedites evolutionary computation. Therefore, this research aimed to solve multi-criteria decision making problems of stock trading investment by integrating evolutionary strategies into the co-evolutionary criteria evaluation model. Since co-evolution strategies are self-calibrating, criteria evaluation can be based on changes in time and environment. Such changes not only correspond with human decision making patterns (i.e., evaluation of dynamic changes in criteria), but also address the weaknesses of multi-criteria decision making (i.e., simplified assignment of weights for various criteria). Co-evolutionary evolution strategies can identify the optimal capital portfolio and can help investors maximize their returns by optimizing the preoperational allocation of limited capital. This experimental study compared general evolution strategies with artificial neural forecast model, and found that co-evolutionary evolution strategies outperform general evolution strategies and substantially outperform artificial neural forecast models. The co-evolutionary criteria evaluation model avoids the problem of oversimplified adaptive functions adopted by general algorithms and the problem of favoring weights but failing to adaptively adjust to environmental change, which is a major limitation of traditional multi-criteria decision making. Doing so allows adaptation of various criteria in response to changes in various capital allocation chromosomes. Capital allocation chromosomes in the proposed model also adapt to various criteria and evolve in ways that resemble thinking patterns.

N2  - Rural transportation management plays a critical role in the sustainable future of human society. Two emerging challenges faced by rural communities today are cost control and equity due to the increasing demand and limited operations resources available and the need to deal with the inevitable tradeoffs among multiple objectives and criteria. In this paper, we develop a new methodology for rural transportation management which takes into consideration of both the equity and cost factors under multiple objectives. We conceptualize and define equity in rural transportation management with the development of new performance measures and an analytical model for decision making with multiple desirable and undesirable objectives. We also develop a heuristic procedure based on data envelopment analysis for characterizing and analyzing the route design choices on the frontier between costs and multi-objective measures of equity. A GIS-based decision support system is constructed to process the extensive data required in our analysis. The new methodology has been successfully implemented by Quinte Access, a not-for-profit organization in a rural community in Ontario, to help redesign bus routes with significant quantitative benefits observed in multiple performance dimensions. It is also expected that the new knowledge, insights, and decision support tools developed through this study for transportation planning, big data management, and transportation service operations can be transferred to other rural communities in order to deliver more sustainable transportation services in rural regions around the world.

N2  - The amount of data collected from different real-world applications is increasing rapidly. When the volume of data is too large to be loaded to memory, it may be impossible to analyze it using a single computer. Although efforts have been taken to manage big data by using a single computer, the problem may not be solved in an acceptable time frame, making parallel computing an indispensable way to handle big data. In this paper, we investigate approaches to attribute reduction in parallel using dominance-based neighborhood rough sets (DNRS), which take into consideration the partial orders among numerical and categorical attribute values, and can be utilized in a multicriteria decision-making method. We first present some properties of attribute reduction in DNRS, and then investigate principles of parallel attribute reduction in DNRS. Parallelization on different components of attribute reduction are explored in detail. Furthermore, parallel attribute reduction algorithms in DNRS are proposed. Experimental results on UCI data and big data show that the proposed parallel algorithm is both effective and efficient.

N2  - Supplier selection is a critical multi-criteria decision making problem for supply chain management. With the emergence of big data, there is an urgent need for data-driven decision making methods. A hybrid DEA-Adaboost model is proposed to meet the challenge. The proposed model is split into the DEA and the learner. The fuzzy multi-objective DEA is used to build the expert database, which contains the appropriate and inappropriate suppliers. The learner is trained by Adaboost from the expert database. Thus, the DEA and derived learner are combined as the hybrid model to reduce the time consumption and computational complexities for suppliers selection. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model improves the accuracy compared with other two approaches.

N2  - A proactive mechanism to learn an efficient strategy for adaptive resource clusters is proposed. In contrast to reactive techniques, that rescale the cluster to fit the past load, a predictive strategy is adopted. The cluster incoming workload is forecasted and an optimization problem is defined whose solution is the optimal action according to a utility function. Genetic-based machine learning techniques are used, including multi-objective evolutionary algorithms under the distal supervised learning setup. Experimental evaluations show that the proactive system presented in this work improves either the energetic efficiency or the number of reconfigurations of previous approaches without a loss in the quality of service. Depending on the predictability of the workload, in real world cluster scenarios additional energy savings of up to approximately 40% were measured over the best previous approach, with a 2× factor increment in the number of reconfigurations.

N2  - The open nature of exploratory learning leads to situations when feedback is needed to address several conceptual difficulties. Not all, however, can be addressed at the same time, as this would lead to cognitive overload and confuse the learner rather than help him/her. To this end, we propose a personalised context-dependent feedback prioritisation mechanism based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Neural Networks (NN). AHP is used to define feedback prioritisation as a multi-criteria decision-making problem, while NN is used to model the relation between the criteria and the order in which the conceptual difficulties should be addressed. When used alone, AHP needs a large amount of data from experts to cover all possible combinations of the criteria, while the AHP-NN synergy leads to a general model that outputs results for any such combination. This work was developed and tested in an exploratory learning environment for mathematical generalisation called eXpresser.

N2  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of freshwater sediments by means of three chemometric techniques for multi-criteria analysis and decision: self-organizing network (SON), self-organizing map (SOM) and PROMETHEE&GAIA (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation with Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Aid). Selected chemometric techniques were applied to the results of Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Hg and As content in thirty Danube and fourteen Sava river sediment samples from Serbia. The potential toxicity of sediments was estimated using Probable Effect Concentrations quotients (mean PEC-Q). According to the SON analysis the Danube sediment samples were divided into three classes, Class I (mean PEC-Q range 0.27–0.51), Class II (mean PEC-Q range 0.50–0.70), and Class III (mean PEC-Q range 0.77–0.97), while the Sava samples were divided into two classes, Class II (two samples, mean PEC-Q values 0.65 and 0.69) and Class III (mean PEC-Q range 0.69–1.00). Using the SOM cluster analysis, both Danube and Sava sediment samples were classified into five subclusters, on the basis of the metal concentration level and further ranked into three levels (for remediation, moderately polluted and not polluted) by the use of multi-criteria ranking PROMETHEE method. Graphical presentation of the results obtained by PROMETHEE method using GAIA descriptive tool has provided an insight into the distribution of examined elements in sediments and has shown a significant correlation between some elements. On the basis of the results obtained, it has been concluded that the proposed chemometric approach could provide useful information in the sediment quality assessment.

N2  - The theories of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and fuzzy logic both aim to model human thinking. In MCDM, aggregation processes and preference modeling play the central role. This paper suggests a consistent framework for modeling human thinking by using the tools of both fields: fuzzy logical operators as well as aggregation and preference operators. In this framework, aggregation, preference, and the logical operators are described by the same unary generator function. Similarly to the implication being defined as a composition of the disjunction and the negation operator, preference operators were introduced as a composition of the aggregative operator and the negation operator. After a profound examination of the main properties of the preference operator, our main goal is the implementation into neural networks. We show how preference can be modeled by a perceptron, and illustrate the results in practical neural applications.

N2  - Decision support systems aim to help a decision maker with selecting the option from a set of available options that best meets her or his needs. In multi-criteria based decision support approaches, a suitability degree is computed for each option, reflecting how suitable that option is considering the preferences of the decision maker. Nowadays, it becomes more and more common that data of different quality, originating from different data sets and different data providers have to be integrated and processed in order to compute the suitability degrees. Also, data sets can be very large such that their data become commonly prone to incompleteness, imprecision and uncertainty. Hence, not all data used for decision making can be trusted to the same extent and consequently, neither the results of computations with such data can be trusted to the same extent. For this reason, data quality assessment becomes an important aspect of a decision making process. To correctly inform the users, it is essential to communicate not only the computed suitability degrees of the available options, but also the confidence about these suitability degrees as can be derived from data quality assessment. In this paper a novel multi-dimensional approach for data quality assessment in multi-criteria decision making, supporting the computation of associated confidence degrees, is presented. Providing confidence information adds an extra dimension to the decision making process and leads to more soundly decisions. The added value of the approach is illustrated with aspects of a geographic decision making process.

N2  - Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role in connecting the physical world with the cyber world through new services and seamless interconnection between heterogeneous devices. Such heterogeneous devices tend to generate a massive volume of Big Data. However, exploiting green schemes for IoT is still a challenge since IoT attains a large scale and becomes more multifaceted, the current trends of analyzing Big Data are not directly applicable to it. Similarly, achieving green IoT through the use of 5G also poses new challenges when it comes to transferring huge volume of data in an efficient way. To address the challenges above, this paper presents a scheme for human- enabled green IoT in 5G network. Green IoT is achieved by grouping mobile nodes in a cluster. Also, a mobility management model is designed that helps in triggering efficient handover and selecting optimal networks based on multi-criteria decision modeling. Afterward, we design a network architecture that integrates green IoT with 5G network. Moreover, the 5G network architecture is supported by proposed protocol stack, which maps Internet Protocol (IP), Medium Access Protocol (MAC), and Location identifiers (LOC). The proposed scheme is also implemented using C programming language to validate mobility model in 5G, regarding cost, energy, and Quality of Service.

N2  - Commissioning is an effective means to reduce the energy consumption of cooling systems in buildings. However, owing to the uncertainty of the load, the deviation between the true value of the load and the predicted value may cause a mismatch between the cooling load and the cooling capacity of the commissioning strategy, resulting in low robustness of the commissioning strategy. Therefore, a low-cost cooling system commissioning strategy, which can effectively quantify the load uncertainty and ensure the robustness of the strategy, is proposed in this study. A Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN) model is established to obtain the uncertainty range of the cooling load of a building in the form of a probability distribution. The low-cost commissioning method under each working condition with different partial load rates is obtained using an optimisation algorithm. An entropy–weight Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) multicriteria decision-making method is applied to optimise the commissioning strategy for the highest guarantee rate and lowest energy consumption. Through the case study of an existing office building located in Inner Mongolia, northern China, it was concluded that the proposed commissioning strategy can reduce the building’s average daily energy consumption by 7.75%. The results indicate that compared with the deterministic commissioning strategy, this robust commissioning strategy can achieve a higher guarantee rate under various load demands. In particular, on days with high load demand, a high guaranteed rate and low energy consumption can be achieved simultaneously.

N2  - Disaggregation methods have become popular in multicriteria decision aiding (MCDA) for eliciting preferential information and constructing decision models from decision examples. From a statistical point of view, data mining and machine learning are also involved with similar problems, mainly with regard to identifying patterns and extracting knowledge from data. Recent research has also focused on the introduction of specific domain knowledge in machine learning algorithms. Thus, the connections between disaggregation methods in MCDA and traditional machine learning tools are becoming stronger. In this paper the relationships between the two fields are explored. The differences and similarities between the two approaches are identified, and a review is given regarding the integration of the two fields.

N2  - This paper presents the integration of a cognitive architecture with an intelligent decision support model (IDSM) that is embedded into an autonomous non-deterministic safety critical system. The IDSM will integrate multi-criteria decision making via intelligent technologies like expert systems, fuzzy logic, machine learning and genetic algorithms. Cognitive technology is currently simulated in safety–critical systems to highlight variables of interest, interface with intelligent technologies, and provide an environment that improves a system’s cognitive performance. In this study, the IDSM is being applied to an actual safety–critical system, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) software. The USV’s safety performance is being researched in a simulated and a real world nautical based environment. The objective is to build a dynamically changing model to evaluate a cognitive architecture’s ability to ensure safe performance of an intelligent safety–critical system. The IDSM does this by finding a set of key safety performance parameters that can be critiqued via safety measurements, mechanisms and methodologies. The uniqueness of this research will be on bounding the decision making associated with the cognitive architecture’s key safety parameters (KSP). Other real-time applications that could benefit from advancing the safety of cognitive technologies are unmanned platforms, transportation technologies, and service robotics. The results will provide cognitive science researchers a reference for safety engineering artificially intelligent safety–critical systems.

N2  - Detection of size, shape and color of minerals are important for obtaining information about minerals. The output of mines is ores which vary in colors and shapes. The multiplicity of ores, large scale features and the importance of speeding up the mineral type detection process for intelligent systems, leads us to rely more on expert's advice and rank the selected available features for type detection, according to their importance. In this paper, to separate different ores and gangue minerals, image processing and computer vision techniques with combination of multi criteria decision making (MCDM) approach are applied. Our method proposes a novel way which combines the image processing techniques and artificial neural networks, with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approaches to detect different types of ores. By help of experts in feature ranking, the image processing techniques proved to be more effective and prompt. The final results show that the proposed method is more successful in type detection of minerals than the other image processing techniques for ores type detection. Our method is also applicable for real-time systems to estimate minerals at on-line ore sorting and classification stages.

N2  - Terrain conditions, stand structure attributes, and environmental factors are important elements that determine the success of timber harvests. Planning designs for timber harvesting projects must also be physically feasible, environmentally acceptable, and economically viable and address potentially competing objectives upfront in a multi-purpose planning effort. Under mountainous conditions involving highly variable and steep terrain, harvest planning is a particularly complex decision-making process. Here, quantitative (objective) information (e.g., stand volume) is jointly considered with qualitative (subjective) information (e.g., expert judgment of slope failure event and preference value of a certain stand) to arrive at a compromise plan that considers conflicting management objectives. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the existing terrain conditions of a large management area to find zones in which harvest operations can be conducted, assess which portions of the terrain can be harvested by different equipment that is available in the region, and locate landing sites for ground-based skidding operations. The criteria used in this study included quantitative and qualitative elements that were measured/evaluated across different scales. To address this complex decision-making process, we used an integrative approach that combined spatial analyses with multiple-criteria decision analysis (SMCDA). Existing geospatial data were combined with information obtained through pairwise evaluations of environmental, topographic, and stand structure elements to create maps in which the terrain was divided into zones of different suitability classes for timber harvests, placement of landing sites, and deployment of different harvesting systems. The results and assessment of this case study indicate that the methodology has great potential for a more integrated policy, in particular, where multiple spatial objectives explicitly need to be taken into consideration when solving complex forest-management problems in mountainous conditions. One key finding from this work that needs to be further explored involves efficient ways of incorporating this methodology into traditional harvest scheduling models to better support the operational and tactical phases of the timber harvesting.

N2  - Supply chain disruptions have serious consequences for society and this has made supply chain risk management (SCRM) an attractive area for researchers and managers. In this paper, we use an objective literature mapping approach to identify, classify, and analyze decision-making models and support systems for SCRM, providing an agenda for future research. Through bibliometric networks of articles published in the Scopus database, we analyze the most influential decision-making models and support systems for SCRM, evaluate the main areas of current research, and provide insights for future research in this field. The main results are the following: we found that the identity of the area is structured in three groups of risk decision support models: (i) quantitative multicriteria decision models, (ii) stochastic decision-making models, and (iii) computational simulation/optimization models. We mapped six current research clusters: (i) conceptual and qualitative risk models, (ii) upstream supply chain risk models, (iii) downstream supply chain risk models, (iv) supply chain sustainability risk models, (v) stochastic and multicriteria decision risk models, and (vi) emerging techniques risk models. We identified seven future research clusters, with insights from further studies for: (i) tools to operate SCRM data, (ii) validation of risk models, (iii) computational improvement for data analysis, (iv) multi-level and multi-period supply chains, (v) agrifood risks, (vi) energy risks and (vii) sustainability risks. Finally, the future research agenda should prioritize SCRM's holistic vision, the relationship between Big Data, Industry 4.0 and SCRM, as well as emerging social and environmental risks.

N2  - With developments in cloud computing and big data, the term “cloud” has become a household name owing to its characteristics of smartness and connectedness. Cloud-based platforms are associated with people. However, multi-objective decision-making problem in cloud platforms has not been extensively studied. There is no consensus on the reasonable and effective implementation of the decision-making model to select the optimum design scheme in a cloud platform and its establishment to objectively evaluate its significance. In this study, to efficiently and accurately realize the optimal selection of design scheme, a fuzzy evaluation mechanism in handling the vagueness and uncertainty is established, with the advantage of quality function deployment and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm in decision analysis. A case study is provided to validate the proposed approach in cloud platforms. To reveal the advantages of the proposed method, it was compared with other methods such as the requirement-scenario-experience evaluation framework and a rough number-based integrated method. MATLAB programming was used for this comparison and accuracy certification. The result shows that the proposed model is more efficient and dynamic and provided users with multidimensional evaluation based on open and distributed resources system.

N2  - The contamination of waters by persistent organic pollutants, especially pharmaceutical contaminants, is one of the concerns all over the world. To date, among the treatment methods, the efficient EAOPs method have shown a high ability to treat this type of pollutant. However, conducting adequate tests for taking into account almost all possible conditions to predict the amount of pollutant removal in different conditions is still a challenge. On the other hand, achieving this aim requires a lot of cost and time. The superiority of data mining based methods over conventional mathematical methods have made these methods a good solution to solve this problem. Hence, in present study a model by employing data mining algorithms includes Artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), M5 model tree, least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) and hybrid of LSSVM and firefly optimization algorithm (FFA), scatter interpolation method, and multi-criteria decision making, namely DID, is presented for modeling of drugs removal. For this purpose, four different inputs include current density, electrolyte concentration, pH, and electrolysis time are used for electrochemical removal of Ciprofloxacin (CIP) as a model pollutant. Subsequently, Scatter interpolation method is used for generating enough data for more accurate modeling and more reliable results. In the final part of the survey, the TOPSIS method under six scenario, is employed for ranking of algorithms by considering accuracy and time criteria. In defined scenarios for TOPSIS, six different weights are considered for time criteria as well as the weights of accuracy are considered as equal in each scenario. Also, the sum of scores of each algorithm in all scenarios is used for final decision. The finding results by TOPSIS for original data showed the superiority of LSSVM_FFA. After generating new data, the M5 and the ANFIS have better results in 0.25 time weight. However, by decreasing time weight and increasing accuracy weight (after second scenario), the M5 and the LSSVM_FFA have better results. Besides, based on the sum of scores for new data, the M5 and the LSSVM_FFA have superiority. Finally, it can be concluded that M5 in about to 3 s, and LSSVM_FFA in about to 17 s lead to estimate the drug removal value with good accuracy, and without needing to high cost, and several months laboratory works. Therefore, the mentioned models can be used for different tasks, such as determining the optimal removal of drug, and investigating the impact of different parameters on drug removal process, without needing to each special experiment. Thus, for generating the large data set, the results of the present study are reliable.

N2  - This article presents a methodology for the construction and use of metamodels with Deep Learning (DL) methods that are useful for making multi-criteria decisions in the design and optimization of one-way slabs. The main motivation behind this research has been to examine the possibilities of improving slab design by including this methodology in future tools, which is capable of calculating thousands of solutions in real time based on the designer’s specifications. The process of creating these metamodels begins by developing a database of millions of combinations of slab designs. These combinations are calculated with a heuristic algorithm that provides the following results: rigidity, deflection, cost per square meter, CO2 emissions and embodied energy. Once a database including the entire universe of possible solutions has been created, a metamodel is developed that is capable of “condensing” the implicit knowledge contained in the database. This metamodel is included within a Decision Support System (DSS) that produces thousands of solutions for slabs that all comply with a range of specifications designated by the design plan. Furthermore, the methodology described herein proposes the use of Pareto-optimal solutions and graphic tools to help designers make multi-criteria decisions regarding the solutions that best fit their needs. A case study is presented to illustrate this proposal: optimizing slab design in two buildings according to technical, economic and sustainability criteria. The results indicate that the multi-criteria solutions obtained would entail a significant reduction in both emissions and embodied energy as compared to mono-criteria solutions, without significantly increasing costs.

N2  - Summary Rice is an important cereal crop, being a staple food for over half of the world's population, and sexual reproduction resulting in grain formation underpins global food security. However, despite considerable research efforts, many of the genes, especially long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) genes, involved in sexual reproduction in rice remain uncharacterized. With an increasing number of public resources becoming available, information from different sources can be combined to perform gene functional annotation. We report the development of MCRiceRepGP, a machine learning framework which integrates heterogeneous evidence and employs multicriteria decision analysis and machine learning to predict coding and lincRNA genes involved in sexual reproduction in rice. The rice genome was reannotated using deep-sequencing transcriptomic data from reproduction-associated tissue/cell types identifying previously unannotated putative protein-coding genes and lincRNAs. MCRiceRepGP was used for genome-wide discovery of sexual reproduction associated coding and lincRNA genes. The protein-coding and lincRNA genes identified have distinct expression profiles, with a large proportion of lincRNAs reaching maximum expression levels in the sperm cells. Some of the genes are potentially linked to male- and female-specific fertility and heat stress tolerance during the reproductive stage. MCRiceRepGP can be used in combination with other genome-wide studies, such as genome-wide association studies, giving greater confidence that the genes identified are associated with the biological process of interest. As more data, especially about mutant plant phenotypes, become available, the power of MCRiceRepGP will grow, providing researchers with a tool to identify candidate genes for future experiments. MCRiceRepGP is available as a web application (http://mcgplannotator.com/MCRiceRepGP/).

N2  - In this paper, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making model is presented based on a feed forward artificial neural network. This model is used to capture and represent the decision makers' preferences. The topology of the neural network model is developed to train the model. The proposed model can use historical data and update the database information for alternatives over time for future decisions. Basically, multi-criteria decision making problems are formulated, and neural network is used to learn the relation among criteria and alternatives and rank the alternatives. We do not use any utility function for the modeling; however, a unique method is proposed for eliciting the information from decision makers. The proposed model is applicable for a wide variety of multi-attribute decision making problems and can be used for future ranking or selection without managers' judgment effort. Simulation of the managers' decisions is demonstrated in detail and the design and implementation of the model are illustrated by a case study.

N2  - Classification of wine represents a multi-criteria decision-making problem characterized by great complexity, non-linearity and lack of objective information regarding the quality of the desired final product. Volatile compounds of wines elaborated from four Galician (NW Spain) autochthonous white Vitis vinifera from four consecutive vintages were analysed by gas chromatography (FID, FPD and MS detectors), and several aroma compounds were used for correctly classifying autochthonous white grape varieties (Albariño, Treixadura, Loureira and Dona Branca). The objective of the work is twofold: to find a classification model able to precisely differentiate between existing grape varieties (i.e. assuring the authenticity), and to assess the discriminatory power of different family compounds over well-known classifiers (i.e. guaranteeing the typicality). From the experiments carried out, and given the fact that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was not able to accurately separate all the wine varieties, this work investigates the suitability of applying different machine learning (ML) techniques (i.e.: Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, MultiLayer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbour and Naïve Bayes) for classification purposes. Perfect classification accuracy is obtained by the Random Forest algorithm, whilst the other alternatives achieved promising results using only part of the available information.

N2  - In this paper, an improved multiobjective optimal control (MOOC) strategy is developed to improve the operational efficiency, satisfy the effluent quality (EQ) and reduce the energy consumption (EC) in wastewater treatment process (WWTP). First, the adaptive kernel function models of the process, which can describe the complex dynamics of EQ and EC, are developed for the proposed MOOC strategy. Meanwhile, a multiobjective optimization problem is constituted to account for WWTP. Second, an improved multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, using a self-adaptive flight parameters mechanism and a multiobjective gradient (MOG) method, is designed to minimize the established objectives. And then the optimal set-points of dissolved oxygen (SO) and nitrate (SNO) are obtained in the treatment process. Third, an adaptive fuzzy neural network controller (FNNC) is applied for realizing the tracking control of the obtained set-points in the proposed MOOC strategy. Finally, Benchmark Simulation Model No.1 (BSM1) is introduced to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MOOC strategy. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed method.

N2  - High data quality is a prerequisite for accurate data analysis. However, data inconsistencies often arise in real data, leading to untrusted decision making downstream in the data analysis pipeline. In this paper, we study the problem of inconsistency detection and repair of the Ontology Multi-dimensional Data Model (OMD). We propose a framework of data quality assessment, and repair for the OMD. We formally define a weight-based repair-by-deletion semantics, and present an automatic weight generation mechanism that considers multiple input criteria. Our methods are rooted in multi-criteria decision making that consider the correlation, contrast, and conflict that may exist among multiple criteria, and is often needed in the data cleaning domain.

N2  - Hot-dip galvanizing is considered one of the most important corrosion protection alternatives for steel; however, its poor environmental performance has been a matter of concern. Even though many researchers have dealt with this topic in the past none of them have jointly dealt with the triple bottom line of sustainable development, and with the random and epistemic uncertainty of its measurement. For that reason, in this work, the sustainability of the hot-dip galvanizing process is investigated integrating: (a) 17 indicators taken from the 4 categories of the GREENSCOPE methodology and one quality performance indicator which is directly related to ISO 1461. (b) The additive utility method for multi-criteria decision-making. (c) The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process used to calculate the relative weights of both indicators and categories by means of a survey. (d) The hierarchical partitioning analysis used for determining the process stages that have a higher impact on sustainability variation, and others useful and suitable statistical tools for data analysis. Furthermore, the proposed framework is tested for a particular hot-dip galvanizing process, considering a random generation of each batch size, steel item characteristics and operating conditions via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. The results show that the stages of pickling and fluxing are critical for the analyzed system and they are not expected to be improved without a significant modification of the process. The proposal outlined in this paper might help designers, process engineers and researchers for a better decision-making process, focusing on the most critical stages while considering the trade-off between the three dimensions of sustainable development.

N2  - The design of funicular (or momentless) submerged arches has a great application in the fields of the building construction and the civil engineering. Traditional approaches in this field have been based on the resolution of ordinary differential equations that govern the structural behavior of the submerged arches. Indeed, these approaches only consider a design parameter and they are computationally expensive. For intermediate depth ratios, the funicular shape of the arch lays about halfway between the geometric forms of the parabola and the ellipse. Actually, the arch centerline could be modeled as a parametric linear function of these two conical shapes where different parameters are established, opening new opportunities for the optimization in the design of such structures, which also consider several design parameters. In this article, we propose a methodology to optimize several parameters in the design of submerged arches. Specifically, we focus on the reduction of the arch bending moment, which is a critical factor in the design cost of the structure, and also the maximization of the airspace enclosed by the arch, which is of particular interest in the serviceability of recreational submerged installations. Our methodology is based on a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which uses artificial neural networks with extreme learning machine (ELM) to predict the level of bending stresses at the submerged arch under different shape configurations and also reduce the overall computational cost. Two groups of test examples, corresponding to deep and shallow waters, are developed to compare the numerical results obtained by multi-objective optimization with the theoretical curves predicted by the traditional funicular analysis. Our experimental results offer good accuracy (R2 up to 93%) in the fitness evaluation using ELM. After the multi-objective optimization procedure, our results show optimal arch-shapes with minimum bending stress (i.e., minimum cost) and maximum airspace; thus, the functionality of the underwater installation is also optimal.

N2  - Pairs trading is a popular speculation strategy. Several implementation methods are proposed in the literature: they can be based on a distance criterion or on co-integration. This article extends previous research in another direction: the combination of forecasting techniques (Neural Networks) and multi-criteria decision making methods (Electre III). The key contribution of this paper is the introduction of multi-step-ahead forecasts. It leads to major changes in the trading system and raises new empirical and methodological questions. The results of an application based on S&P 100 Index stocks are promising: this methodology could be a powerful tool for pairs selection in a highly non-linear environment.

N2  - In the present study, an optimal renewable energy management strategy (REMS) is proposed as a sustainable policy for non-fossil fuel-based centralistic energy policies. Accordingly, the demand load data and weather big datasets were analyzed using neural networks and analysis of variance, respectively. Biogas generation was modeled using a BSM2 dynamic model, and the available hydropower was evaluated in the form of a techno-economic assessment. A hybrid solar PV/wind turbine/biogas generator/hydroturbine/battery/inverter system was simulated as a gauge unit using the processed data to evaluate the potential of all renewable energies in Iran. The results were used to cluster Iran into various classes based on optimal green energy potential using a K-means algorithm. A factor analysis (FA) was performed using a big matrix consisting of 13 social, economic, environmental, and technical variables in all of Iran's provinces. Factor score coefficients were then employed in a mature multi-criteria decision making analysis technique to determine the order preference for an ideal solution (TOPSIS). These details were used to inform the REMS. The optimal hybrid renewable energy maps were generated and were combined with the FA-TOPSIS results to produce an action plan proposal. The results show that FA can explain 99% of the variance in the big data matrix. Iran can be efficiently clustered into five classes, while a four-stage action plan can assure sustainable development.

N2  - The recent crisis highlighted, once again, the importance of early warning models to assess the soundness of individual banks. In the present study, we use six quantitative techniques originating from various disciplines to classify banks in three groups. The first group includes very strong and strong banks; the second one includes adequate banks, while the third group includes banks with weaknesses or serious problems. We compare models developed with financial variables only, with models that incorporate additional information in relation to the regulatory environment, institutional development, and macroeconomic conditions. The accuracy of classification of the models that include only financial variables is rather poor. We observe a substantial improvement in accuracy when we consider the country-level variables, with five out of the six models achieving out-of-sample classification accuracy above 70% on average. The models developed with multi-criteria decision aid and artificial neural networks achieve the highest accuracies. We also explore the development of stacked models that combine the predictions of the individual models at a higher level. While the stacked models outperform the corresponding individual models in most cases, we found no evidence that the best stacked model can outperform the best individual model.

N2  - A new integrated and generic Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) is presented based on a combination of Artificial Intelligence and Multicriteria Decision Analysis techniques. The approach proposed is developed to address commonly faced spatial decision problems of site selection, site ranking, impact assessment and spatial knowledge discovery under one system. The site selection module utilises a theme-based Analytical Hierarchy Process. Two novel site ranking techniques are introduced. The first is based on a systematic neighbourhood comparison of sites with respect to key datasets (criterions). The second utilises multivariate ordering capability of one-dimensional Self-Organizing Maps. The site impact assessment module utilises a new spatially enabled Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix. A spatial variant of General Regression Neural Networks is developed for Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and prediction analysis. The developed system is proposed as a useful modern tool that facilitates quantitative and evidence based decision making in multicriteria decision environment. The intended users of the system are decision makers in government organisations, in particular those involved in planning and development when taking into account socio-economic, environmental and public health related issues.

N2  - Sediment is an important part of an aquatic ecosystem, so it is essential to develop an effective sediment quality assessment tool. This study aims to develop a new sediment quality assessment tool using a Weight of Evidence approach in combination with the grey TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity, a mathematical calculation of multi-criteria decision analysis). This tool can analyze data from chemical analyses, laboratory toxicity tests and benthic community structure analyses to generate individual results from each line of evidence, and integrate data from these three lines of evidence to obtain an overall assessment through an Excel Visual Basic for Application program. The tool can compare the relative magnitude of risks among sites and rate each site with high, moderate, or low ecological risk, thus guiding us to take pertinent measures toward polluted sediment. A case study of the sediment of Dongjiang River basin, south China, demonstrated the successful application of this tool. It proved that this assessment tool can provide a comprehensive and accurate assessment of sediment quality and efficiently discriminate risks among different sites, suggesting it is a powerful tool for environment risk assessment.

N2  - ABSTRACT In this article the financial/ownership structures of agribusiness cooperatives are analyzed to examine whether new cooperative models perform better than the more traditional ones. The assessment procedure introduces a new financial decision-aid approach, which is based on data-analysis techniques in combination with a preference ranking organization method of enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE II). The application of this multicriteria decision-aid approach allows the rank ordering of cooperatives based on the most prominent financial ratios. The financial ratios were selected using principal component analysis. This analytical procedure reduces the dimensionality of large numbers of interrelated financial performance measures. We assess the financial success of Dutch agribusiness cooperatives for the period 1999?2010. Results show that there is no clear-cut evidence that cooperative models used to attract extra members? investments and/or outside equity perform better than the more traditional models. This suggests that ownership structure of cooperatives is not always a decisive factor for their financial success. [EconLit citations: Q130, G320, C440].

N2  - Study region Mahanadi Basin, India. Study focus Flood is one of the most common hydrologic extremes which are frequently experienced in Mahanadi basin, India. During flood times it becomes difficult to collect information from all rain gauges. Therefore, it is important to find out key rain gauge (RG) networks capable of forecasting the flood with desired accuracy. In this paper a procedure for the design of key rain gauge network particularly important for the flood forecasting is discussed and demonstrated through a case study. New hydrological insights for the region This study establishes different possible key RG networks using Hall’s method, analytical hierarchical process (AHP), self organization map (SOM) and hierarchical clustering (HC) using the characteristics of each rain gauge occupied Thiessen polygon area. Efficiency of the key networks is tested by artificial neural network (ANN), Fuzzy and NAM rainfall-runoff models. Furthermore, flood forecasting has been carried out using the three most effective RG networks which uses only 7 RGs instead of 14 gauges established in the Kantamal sub-catchment, Mahanadi basin. The Fuzzy logic applied on the key RG network derived using AHP has shown the best result for flood forecasting with efficiency of 82.74% for 1-day lead period. This study demonstrates the design procedure of key RG network for effective flood forecasting particularly when there is difficulty in gathering the information from all RGs.

N2  - Within procurement literature; many studies focus on providing decision support to the supplier selection problem. However, studies on group decision support are yet to be explored extensively within supplier selection literature, despite its benefits. This study presents the application of a hybrid approach for group decision support for the supplier selection problem. fuzzy set theory, analytic hierarchy process and neural networks have been integrated to provide group decision support under consensus achievement. Discriminant analysis has been used for the purpose of supplier base rationalization, through which suppliers have been mapped to highly suitable and less suitable supplier classes. The proposed integrated approach has been further studied through two case studies and the proposed approach has been compared with another approach for group decision making under consensus and other approaches for prioritization using AHP, without consensus achievement. A very high accuracy in capturing the collective consensual preferences of the group was established across eight cross-validation tests from the two case studies, for the hybrid approach, even with extremely limited count of data sets which were used for training the hybrid model.

N2  - The purpose of this study is to develop a hybrid methodology that integrates machine learning algorithms with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques to effectively conduct multi-attribute inventory analysis. In the proposed methodology, first, ABC analyses using three different MCDM methods (i.e. simple-additive weighting, analytical hierarchy process, and VIKOR) are employed to determine the appropriate class for each of the inventory items. Following this, naïve Bayes, Bayesian network, artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are implemented to predict classes of initially determined stock items. Finally, the detailed prediction performance metrics of algorithms for each method are determined. The comprehensive case study executed at a large-scale automotive company revealed that the best classification accuracy is achieved by SVMs. The results also revealed that Bayesian networks, SVMs and ANNs are all capable of successfully dealing with the unbalanced data problems associated with Pareto distribution, and each of these algorithms performed well against all examined measures, thus validating the fact that machine learning algorithms are highly applicable to inventory classification problems. Therefore, this study presents uniqueness in that it is the first and foremost of its kind to effectively combine MCDM methods with machine learning algorithms in multi-attribute inventory classification and is practically applicable in various inventory settings.

N2  - Floods around the world are having devastating effects on human life and property. In this paper, three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) analysis techniques (VIKOR, TOPSIS and SAW), along with two machine learning methods (NBT and NB), were tested for their ability to model flood susceptibility in one of China’s most flood-prone areas, the Ningdu Catchment. Twelve flood conditioning factors were used as input parameters: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), lithology, land use, distance from river, curvature, altitude, Stream Transport Index (STI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), soil type, slope and rainfall. The predictive capacity of the models was evaluated and validated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). While all models showed a strong flood prediction capability (AUC > 0.95), the NBT model performed best (AUC = 0.98), suggesting that, among the models studied, the NBT model is a promising tool for the assessment of flood-prone areas and can allow for proper planning and management of flood hazards.

N2  - Intuitionistic fuzzy set plays a vital role in decision making, data analysis, and artificial intelligence. Many decision-making problems consist of different types of datum, where fuzzy set theoretical approaches may fail to obtain the optimal decision. Numerous approaches for intuitionistic fuzzy decision-making problem have been introduced in the literature to overcome these short comings. But there is no single approach that can be used to solve all kinds of problems because of the partial ordering defined on the collection of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs). Even though ranking of fuzzy numbers have been studied from early seventies in the last century, a total order on the entire class of fuzzy numbers has been introduced by Wang and Wang (Fuzzy Sets Syst 2014, 243, 131?141) only on 2014. A total order on the collection of all IFN is an open problem till today. In this article, a total order on the entire class of IFN using upper lower dense sequence in the interval [0, 1] is proposed and compared with existing techniques using illustrative examples, further an algorithm (which is problem independent) for solving any intuitionistic fuzzy multicriteria decision-making problem (Intuitionistic fuzzy MCDM) is introduced. This new total ordering on IFNs generalizes the total ordering defined in Wang and Wang () for fuzzy numbers. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Complexity 21: 54?66, 2016

N2  - Out of several generalizations of fuzzy set theory for various objectives, the notions introduced by Atanassov, 1983, Atanassov and Gargov, 1989 in defining intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets are interesting and very useful in modeling real life problems. Ranking of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets plays a vital role in decision-making, data analysis, artificial intelligence and socioeconomic system and it was studied in Xu, 2007c, Xu and Chen, 2007a, Ye, 2009. In this paper a new method for ranking interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets has been introduced and studied. The method is illustrated by numerical examples and compared with other methods. And then a new method for handling multi-criteria fuzzy decision-making problems based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets is presented in which criterion values for alternatives are interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The method proposed here can provide a useful way to efficiently help the decision-maker to make his decision. An illustrative example is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

N2  - The paper presents a multi-disciplinary multi-objective design optimization methodology of a combustion chamber effusion cooling system. The optimizer drives an Artificial Neural Network and a Manufacturing Time Model in a repeated analysis scheme in order to increase the combustor liner LCF life and to reduce the liner cooling system manufacturing time, simultaneously. The ANN is trained with a set of fluid/structure/lifing simulations arranged in a three-levels dataset based on a properly designed DOE approach. The CFD simulations are carried out with a reliable and robust in-house developed three-dimensional high resolution reactive viscous flow solver, accounting for conjugate heat transfer approach; the liner structural analysis is performed with a standard FEM code while the liner life assessments are obtained through an in-house developed software operating on the temperature/stress fields. Results demonstrate the validity of the overall approach in a five-dimensional state space with truly moderate computational costs.

N2  - This study presents a novel framework to optimize Low Impact Development (LID) practices for urban storm water management. First, the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) model was executed for different possible scenarios of input parameters and various LIDs to simulate runoff volume, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) loads. Next, a neural network (MLP-ANN) was trained and validated, as a surrogate model, against the set of inputs and output variables from the SWMM model simulations. The inherent uncertainties in the rainfall-runoff modeling were accounted for using a Nonlinear Interval Number Programming (NINP) model, and stakeholders' interactions are considered using a leader-follower game model. Velenjak urban watershed in Tehran, Iran, with four key stakeholders was considered as the study area. Tehran Municipality is the financial service provider that makes the first decision the leader-follower structure, and is considered as the leader with the priority of minimizing LIDs’ construction and maintenance costs. Tehran Department of Environmental Protection, Tehran Regional Water company, and Tehran Province Water and Wastewater company are the main followers in the decision making structure in the study area. This game theoretical framework yields several Pareto optimal solutions given the conflicting utilities of various players, and a Multi Criteria Decision Making procedure – i.e. PROMETHEE model – selects the most preferred compromised option. Fourteen weighting scenarios were considered in the PROMETHEE model to determine the compromise solution among the 52 solutions on the trade-off curve. The novelty of this study lies in using a nonlinear interval conflict resolution multi-objective optimization model for urban storm water management based on a leader-follower game. The proposed methodology warrants BOD and TSS loads, as well as storm water volume, are all reduced, with the highest reductions of 93, 86 and 90 percent, respectively. Results testify to the efficacy of the proposed model for urban storm water management.

N2  - Early diagnosis is still the most important factor to deal with skin cancer, a disease that challenges physicians and researchers. It has benefited from computer-aided diagnosis methods that successfully combine dermoscopy, Digital Image Processing, and Machine Learning techniques. This paper aims to approximate medical professionals working with dermoscopy to these methods, to join the challenge of melanoma early detection. Accordingly, a proposal for extracting, selecting and combining texture and shape features from dermoscopic images is presented. The Feature Selection task is added to the learning process to potentiate the quality of classification models. Three classical Machine Learning algorithms were applied to differentiate melanoma from non-melanoma images. The models are evaluated by standard performance measures and a multi-criteria decision analysis method. This is the first time such method is used in melanoma diagnosis. As a result, we found a decision tree that performs well and allows the explicit representation and analysis of the knowledge learned from the images. In addition, the competitiveness of our decision models in comparison with literature approaches reviewed in this work encourages further applications of Machine Learning and Feature Selection to assist computer-aided diagnosis.

N2  - The skyline query as an important aspect of big data management, has received considerable attention from the database community, due to its importance in many applications including multi-criteria decision making, preference answering, and so forth. Moreover, the uncertain data from many applications have become increasing distributed, which makes the central assembly of data at one location for storage and query infeasible and inefficient. The lack of global knowledge and the computational complexity derived from the introduction of the data uncertainty make the skyline query over distributed uncertain data extremely challenging. Although many efforts have addressed the skyline query problem over various distributed scenarios, existing studies still lack the approaches to efficiently process the query. In this paper, we extensively study the distributed probabilistic skyline query problem and propose an efficient approach GDPS to address the problem with an optimized iterative feedback mechanism based on the grid summary. Furthermore, many strategies for further optimizing the query are also proposed, including the optimization strategies for the local pruning, tuple selecting and the server pruning. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data sets have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach by comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches.

N2  - The increasing competition among industries has led to the emergence of numerous tools and methods to support decision making focused on assets maintenance in a company, since ensuring good maintenance is directly linked with greater reliability and uptime for equipment, reducing losses in production processes and consequently increasing profitability. This work aims to use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms - Bayesian Networks (BN) and attribute relevance analysis (ARA), implemented in the Weka® platform, to process a dataset of event logs failure of industrial machine components. The approach aims to use the conditional probability relations generated by the BN and the ranking of criteria relevance for the design of an AHP decision-making model within the scope of industrial maintenance to prioritize which components of a specific machine are more susceptible to failures. The proposed integration mechanism aims to bring greater reliability to the weights assigned to the criteria of the AHP model, and consequently, a more accurate decision support. The results showed that the AHP model generated from a Bayesian Network is consistent with the conditional probabilities estimated by the BN, giving robustness to the decision sphere in the context of industrial maintenance. This AHP model can serve as a basis to be complemented by qualitative analysis criteria according to the need of the individual specialist, allowing the construction of strategic maintenance action plans.

N2  - Objective To integrate multiple sources of clinical information with patient feedback to build evidence-based decision support model to facilitate treatment selection for patients suffering from vestibular schwannomas (VS). Methods This was a mixed methods study utilizing focus group and survey methodology to solicit feedback on factors important for making treatment decisions among patients. Two 90-minute focus groups were conducted by an experienced facilitator. Previously diagnosed VS patients were recruited by clinical investigators at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). Classical content analysis was used for focus group data analysis. Providers were recruited from practices within the UPMC system and were surveyed using Delphi methods. This information can provide a basis for multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework to develop a treatment decision support system for patients with VS. Results Eight themes were derived from these data (focus group + surveys): doctor/health care system, side effects, effectiveness of treatment, anxiety, mortality, family/other people, quality of life, and post-operative symptoms. These data, as well as feedback from physicians were utilized in building a multi-criteria decision model. Discussion The study illustrated steps involved in the development of a decision support model that integrates evidence-based data and patient values to select treatment alternatives. Conclusions Studies focusing on the actual development of the decision support technology for this group of patients are needed, as decisions are highly multifactorial. Such tools have the potential to improve decision making for complex medical problems with alternate treatment pathways.

N2  - In HVAC system design for passenger rail vehicles minimization of objectives on merchantability (initial costs), integration (equipment mass, volume), and operation (electric power demand, noise emissions) becomes increasingly important. Identification of appropriate process and component design parameters is a significant engineering challenge, particularly for emerging R744 (CO2) refrigerant cycles. In this work the sizes of the compressor, evaporator, gas cooler, cooler fan, and internal heat exchanger, plus the high pressure level and the cooler air flow rate of an R744 cycle were subject to multi-objective genetic optimization. Computationally inexpensive artificial neural networks were used as interface between different computation tools. As a result a set of Pareto-optimal R744 cycles was obtained to support the design engineer. For minimum volume and mass (153 l, 169 kg), total electric power demand was 9.2 kW. Vice-versa, minimum power demand (6.9 kW) yielded a large (272 l), heavy (198 kg), and expensive system.

N2  - The decision to install a particular type of green roof (GR) should be made during the design stage of a project due to the different costs and benefits each GR type offers. Although much research has been conducted into the various types of GR, there is a gap in our understanding of the process of decision-making during the selection of a GR type. This paper aims to develop a decision support system (DSS) for selecting the optimum type of GR for residential buildings in Kuala Lumpur. The decision criteria were initially determined using fuzzy Delphi method, followed by the creation of a database based on expert opinions, where the experts met certain criteria regarding their expertise in this field. For data analysis, a cybernetic fuzzy analytic network process was employed as a hybrid method that ignores the least important criteria in selecting the optimum type of GR for a building. Three examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of this prototype DSS in detail. Finally, it was concluded that the prototype DSS automates the entire process of GR type selection. Moreover, it enables decision-makers to select the most suitable alternative considering all significant financial and non-financial decision criteria.

N2  - Summary The flux switching permanent magnet (FSPM) motor is relatively a new topology of the permanent magnet (PM) motors, which both PM and armature winding are placed at the stator. This feature leads to more robust design, better heat dissipation, and a proper option for a wide range of industrial applications. The critical part of the development of FSPM motor is the design optimization of the structure to improve the electromagnetic performance of the motor. In this article, first to reduce the computation time and required memory of the optimization procedure, the multiobjective sensitivity analysis based on design of experiment is performed to specify the most effective parameters on the objectives. Then, the initial samples data of the optimization procedure is obtained by 2D finite element method (FEM) model of the FSPM motor, which is validated by the prototype of the motor. Furthermore, based on FEM results the multilayers perceptron artificial neural network for the approximation of relation between design variables and objectives is implemented. Finally, using the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, the optimization procedure of the FSPM motor is done. The accuracy of the presented optimization procedure is validated by a comparison of the initial prototype and final design of the motor.

N2  - Abstract Reflectarray antennas (RAs) have the ability to combine the advantages of both traditional parabolic reflector and phased array antennas without the need for feed network designs. Microstrip reflectarrays (MRAs) have the advantages of being small size, light weighted, easy to prototyped, high gain, low side-lobe level, and a predetermined radiation pattern. These can be achieved by precise calculation of reflection phase at each RA unit independently with a phase compensation proportional to the distance from the feed. The challenging problem is to have a fast and high accurate unit element to be used in multidimension, multiobjective design optimization. Herein, artificial intelligence algorithms (AIAs) have been used for prediction of reflection phase characterization of an X band MRA unit element with respect to the geometrical design parameters. Firstly, a nonuniform unit RA has been designed in 3D electromagnetic (EM) simulation tool for creating the training validation data sets. Then, the data sets are given to the different types of AIA regression models such as multilayer perceptron, symbolic regression, and convolutional neural network. From the results of the validation data set, it can be concluded that the proposed models have sufficient accuracy that can be used in a computationally efficient design optimization process of a large-scale RA design.

N2  - This article seeks to enhance multi criteria decision making by providing a scientific approach for decomposing and structuring decision problems. We propose a process, based on concept mapping, which integrates group creativity techniques, card sorting procedures, quantitative data analysis and algorithmic automatization to construct meaningful and complete hierarchies of criteria. The algorithmic aspect is covered by a newly proposed recursive cluster algorithm, which automatically generates hierarchies from card sorting data. Based on comparison with another basic algorithm and empirical engineered and real-case test data, we validate that our process efficiently produces reasonable hierarchies of descriptive elements like goal- or problem-criteria.

N2  - The unique ability of shape memory alloy or smart alloy to memorize its previous form has drawn notable attention recently in a wide range of commercial applications. In efforts to precisely predict and compare few significant WEDM machinability aspects like surface roughness [arithmetic mean roughness (Ra), root mean square roughness (Rq) and maximum peak-to-valley height (Rz)] and micro-hardness (MH) of shape memory alloy nitinol, general regression neural network (GRNN) model was developed. Five critical machining parameter, namely pulse-on time (TON), discharge current (I), wire feed (WF), wire tension (WT) and flushing pressure (FP) were taken as machining input for the experiments. The grid search method was employed to minimize cross-validation error. The developed GRNN model predicted the responses within ±10% error indicating GRNN as a competent strategy to predict WEDM responses. A multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach, Fuzzy logic coupled with multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (MOORA) is introduced to optimize different correlated responses. The parametric combination, TON = 12 µs, I = 10 A, WT = 12 N, WS = 150 mm/s. and FP = 8 Bar, were found to yield the preferred results. ANOVA test shows the efficiency of this hybrid MCDM model. Confirmation test has been done to validate the optimum process combination which demonstrates the improvement in WEDM responses. FESEM micrographs identifies lump of debris, micro cracks, pockmarks and recast layer in the machined surfaces.

N2  - Choosing the appropriate forecasting technique to employ is a challenging issue and requires a comprehensive analysis of empirical results. Recent research findings reveal that the performance evaluation of forecasting models depends on the accuracy measures adopted. Some methods indicate superior performance when error based metrics are used, while others perform better when precision values are adopted as accuracy measures. As scholars tend to use a smaller subset of accuracy metrics to assess the performance of forecasting models, there is a need for a concept of multiple accuracy dimensions to assure the robustness of evaluation. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to propose a decision making model that allows researchers to identify the superiority of a forecasting technique over another by considering several accuracy metrics concurrently. A multi-criteria decision analysis approach, namely the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE), was adopted to solve this problem. Bayesian Networks, Artificial Neural Networks, SVMs, Logistic Regression, and several Rule and Tree-based forecasting approaches were included in the analysis. After introducing a detailed description of accuracy measures, the performance of the prediction models are evaluated using a chosen dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

N2  - The topic of clustering has been widely studied in the field of Data Analysis, where it is defined as an unsupervised process of grouping objects together based on notions of similarity. Clustering in the field of Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) has seen a few adaptations of methods from Data Analysis, most of them however using concepts native to that field, such as the notions of similarity and distance measures. As in MCDA we model the preferences of a decision maker over a set of decision alternatives, we can find more diverse ways of comparing them than in Data Analysis. As a result, these alternatives may also be arranged into different potential structures. In this paper we wish to formally define the problem of clustering in MCDA using notions that are native to this field alone, and highlight the different structures which we may try to uncover through this process. Following this we propose a method for finding these structures. As in any clustering problem, finding the optimal result in an exact manner is impractical, and so we propose a stochastic heuristic approach, which we validate through tests on a large set of artificially generated benchmarks.

N2  - Abstract Objectives To test the ability of a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to incorporate disparate data sources of varying quality along with clinical judgement in a benefit?risk assessment of six well-known pain-relief drugs. Methods Six over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics were evaluated against three favourable effects and eight unfavourable effects by seven experts who specialise in the relief of pain, two in a 2-day facilitated workshop whose input data and judgements were later peer-reviewed by five additional experts. Key findings Ibuprofen salts and solubilised emerged with the best benefit?risk profile, followed by naproxen, ibuprofen acid, diclofenac, paracetamol and aspirin. Conclusions Multicriteria decision analysis enabled participants to evaluate the OTC analgesics against a range of favourable and unfavourable effects in a group setting that enabled all issues to be openly aired and debated. The model was easily communicated and understood by the peer reviewers, so the model should be comprehensible to physicians, pharmacists and other health professionals.

N2  - The growing role of sustainability in the construction industry must be considered in the entire lifecycle of a building. This way BIM (Building Information Modeling) figures as an important factor in the management of this lifecycle, from design and construction, through the operation and maintenance until the demolition. An efficient interoperability along the lifecycle supported by BIM allows an overall better management and help users to improve sustainability of projects. This interoperability must consider not only data, but also should be concerned with broader aspects, such as processes and guidelines, avoiding information loss, facilitating analysis, and therefore, improving sustainability. In the light of this scenario, a systematic literature review was performed considering sustainability factors, interoperability concerns and lifecycle stages. This review was based on existing methods complemented by a multicriteria decision analysis method to aid the selection of relevant papers. Also, a qualitative data analysis was performed to identify the relations of the fields studied. Results showed that even though some fields receive much attention in the literature, few studies are performed considering interoperability in the entire lifecycle of sustainable buildings. Also, results showed the relevant connections among lifecycle stages and sustainability fields, providing an influence matrix of these two areas. This review can be used as a tool to organize knowledge and data and systematize processes and even to structure interoperability frameworks.

N2  - Forest fires threaten a large part of the world's forests, communities, and industrial plants, triggering technological accidents (Natechs). Forest fire modelling with respect to contributing spatial parameters is one of the well-known ways not only to predict the fire occurrence in forests, but also to assess the risk of forest-fire-induced Natechs. This study is a review of methods based on geospatial information system (GIS) for modelling forest fires and their potential Natechs that have been implemented all over the world. The present study conducts a systematic literature review of the methods used for forest fire susceptibility, hazard, and risk assessment, while dividing them into four general categories: (a) statistical and data-driven models; (b) machine learning models; (c) multi-criteria decision-making models, and (d) ensemble models. In addition, some forest fire detection techniques using satellite imagery are reviewed. A comparison is also conducted to highlight the research gaps and required future research. The results of the present research assist decision makers to select the most appropriate techniques according to specific forest conditions. Results show that data-driven approaches are the most frequently applied methods while ensemble approaches are more accurate.

N2  - Dynamic optimization problems involving two or more conflicting objectives appear in many real-world scenarios, and more cases are expected to appear in the near future with the increasing interest in the analysis of streaming data sources in the context of Big Data applications. However, approaches combining dynamic multi-objective optimization with preference articulation are still scarce. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic multi-objective optimization algorithm called InDM2 that allows the preferences of the decision maker (DM) to be incorporated into the search process. When solving a dynamic multi-objective optimization problem with InDM2, the DM can not only express her/his preferences by means of one or more reference points (which define the desired region of interest), but these points can be also modified interactively. InDM2 is enhanced with methods to graphically display the different approximations of the region of interest obtained during the optimization process. In this way, the DM is able to inspect and change, in optimization time, the desired region of interest according to the information displayed. We describe the main features of InDM2 and detail how it is implemented. Its performance is illustrated using both synthetic and real-world dynamic multi-objective optimization problems.

N2  - Treated wastewater resource is underexploited in Cebala’s Irrigated scheme (Northern Tunisia) and farmers are reluctant to reuse it. The delimitation of the irrigated area will help enhance the global economic profitability of the perimeter not only by reducing the operation and maintenance costs but also by optimizing the reuse activity according to the farmers’ demands, their aspirations and aims. Thus, the aim of this paper is to consider reducing the surface of the irrigated area, keeping only the parcels where the resource is highly demanded. A spatial data analysis using a multicriteria decision technique (compromise programming—CP) and a geographical information system was carried out to choose the best scenario. To this end, five zones where breeding activity is well developed and the non-conventional resource highly demanded were identified as the closest delimitations to the ideal solution. The Compromise programming method was used to rank these solutions. Finally, a surface of 2485ha was identified as the best delimitation scenario, corresponding to the area where breeding activity is well developed.

N2  - In this study, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is used for multi-criteria decision making in supplier evaluation and selection problem. The contemporary supply-chain management is looking for both quantitative and qualitative measures other than just getting the lowest price. After evaluating a number of distinct suppliers, determining the reliable suppliers by ANFIS model with better approximation will support decision makers. To this end, ANFIS is evaluated for different data sets with the attributes of the suppliers and their scores that are gathered from a previous study conducted for the same problem under the name of Neural Network (NN) application for fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making model. In the proposed ANFIS model built for determining supplier score, linear regression analysis (R-value) and Mean Square Error (MSE) were 0.8467 and 0.0134, respectively, while they were 0.7733 and 0.0193 for NN for fuzzy. ANFIS gives better results according to MSEs. Hence, it is determined that ANFIS algorithm can be used in multi-criteria decision making problems for supplier evaluation and selection with more precise and reliable results.

N2  - The popularity of business intelligence (BI) systems to support business analytics has tremendously increased in the last decade. The determination of data items that should be stored in the BI system is vital to ensure the success of an organisation's business analytic strategy. Expanding conventional BI systems often leads to high costs of internally generating, cleansing and maintaining new data items whilst the additional data storage costs are in many cases of minor concern – what is a conceptual difference to big data systems. Thus, potential additional insights resulting from a new data item in the BI system need to be balanced with the often high costs of data creation. While the literature acknowledges this decision problem, no model-based approach to inform this decision has hitherto been proposed. The present research describes a prescriptive framework to prioritise data items for business analytics and applies it to human resources. To achieve this goal, the proposed framework captures core business activities in a comprehensive process map and assesses their relative importance and possible data support with multi-criteria decision analysis.

N2  - Symbolic, subsymbolic, and hybrid approaches to rule extraction have so far relied on subsets of first-order logic to cope with the expressiveness trade-off of knowledge representation, on black-box approaches based on artificial neural networks, or on frequent association rule mining in the knowledge discovery and data mining fields. In this article, we present an entirely new method for rule extraction in knowledge-based systems that consists in retrieving an initial set of rules extracted from a knowledge base using conventional logical approaches and then ranking this initial set of rules applying a psychologically motivated multicriteria decision analysis method. We show how this method can be used to implement a knowledge-based management system, demonstrate that this method outperforms the most efficient algorithms for rule extraction proposed to date in the knowledge representation and knowledge discovery fields, and describe its implementation in a knowledge-based innovation tutoring system.

N2  - The Social Web promotes social interactions among people through Web 2.0 technologies. In this context, User-Generated Content (UGC) spreads across social media platforms in the absence of traditional intermediaries that can verify both the believability of the content and the reliability of the sources that generated it. For this reason, the problem of how to assess the credibility of UGC is receiving nowadays increasing attention. In the literature, several approaches have tackled this issue mainly as a classification problem, by categorizing information into genuine and fake. The majority of the proposed solutions follows a data-driven approach, by employing supervised or semi-supervised machine learning techniques that act on multiple features related to credibility. Despite its effectiveness, however, machine learning may present some possible drawbacks, including data-dependency and the possible inscrutability of the contribution that single or interacting features have in the final classification process. In this paper, a Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach is proposed, aimed to assess the credibility of UGC. A given information item (alternative) is evaluated with respect to the considered credibility features (criteria) based on prior domain knowledge, where an overall credibility estimate is obtained by means of a suitable model-driven approach based on aggregation operators. The credibility estimate allows to classify credible UGC with respect to non-credible one, and can also be used to provide a ranking of the alternatives with respect to credibility. To consider interactions among features, the Choquet integral is employed.

N2  - Multi-criteria decision making problem has been well studied for many years. One popular query for multi-criteria decision making is top-k queries which require each user to specify an exact utility function. In many cases, the utility function of a user is probabilistic and finding the distribution on the utility functions has been widely explored in the machine learning areas, such as user's recommender systems, Bayesian learning models and user's preference elicitation, for improving user's experience. Motivated by this, we propose a new type of queries called k-hit queries, which has not been studied before. Given a set D of tuples in the database, the distribution θ on utility functions and a positive integer k, we would like to select a set of k tuples from D in order to maximize the probability that at least one of tuples in the selection set is the favorite of a user. All applications for top-k queries can naturally be used in k-hit queries. In this paper, we present various interesting properties of k-hit queries. Besides, based on these properties, we propose a novel algorithm called k-hit_Alg for k-hit queries. Finally, we conducted comprehensive experiments to show that the performance of our proposed method, k hit_Alg, is superior compared with other existing algorithms which were originally used to answer other existing queries.

N2  - Abstract Because of the current shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources, it is necessary to plan for the installation of new infrastructure to meet the demand for clean energy. Traditional methods for determining wind turbine site suitability suffer from the selection of arbitrary criteria and model parameters by experts, which may lead to a degree of uncertainty in the models produced. An alternative empirically based methodology for building a wind turbine siting model for the state of Iowa is presented in the study. We employ ?ecological niche? principles traditionally utilized to model species allocation to develop a new multicriteria, spatially explicit framework for wind turbine placement. Using information on suitability conditions at existing turbine locations, we incorporate seven variables (wind speed, elevation, slope, land cover, distance of infrastructure and settlements, and population density) into two machine-learning algorithms [maximum entropy method (Maxent) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Prediction (GARP)] to model suitable areas for installation of wind turbines. The performance of this method is tested at the statewide level and a six-county region in western Iowa. Maxent and GARP identified areas in the Northwest and North Central regions of Iowa as the optimum location for new wind turbines. Information on variable contributions from Maxent illuminates the relative importance of environmental variables and its scale-dependent nature. It also allows validating existing assumptions about the relationship between variables and wind turbine suitability. The resultant models demonstrate high levels of accuracy and suggest that the presented approach is a possible methodology for developing wind turbine siting applications.

N2  - Concurrent with global economic development in the last 50 years, the opportunities for the spread of existing diseases and emergence of new infectious pathogens, have increased substantially. The activities associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency, of biases associated with these data.

N2  - In this work, a group of metallic aluminum foam-cored sandwich panels (AFSPs) were used as vehicle armor against blast loading. The dynamic responses of the AFSPs with various combinations of face-sheet materials were analyzed using LS-DYNA. It was found that the AFSP with an aluminum (AA2024 T3) front face and a Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA) steel back face (labeled T3-AF-RHA) outperformed the other panel configurations in terms of maximum back face deflection (MaxD) and areal specific energy absorption (ASEA). It was also found that boundary conditions and the standoff distance (SoD) between an explosive and a target surface both have a remarkable influence on the blast response of the AFSPs. Using artificial neural network (ANN) approximation models, multi-objective design optimization (MDO) of the T3-AF-RHA panel was performed both with and without variations in blast load intensity. The optimization results show that the two objectives of MaxD minimization and ASEA maximization conflict with each other and that the optimal designs must be identified in a Pareto sense. Moreover, the Pareto curves obtained are different for varied blast impulse levels. Consequently, it is concluded that loading variation should be considered when designing such sandwich armors to achieve more robust blast-resistant performance.

N2  - Sustainable urban surface runoff management is receiving increased attention due to environmental and ecological consequences related to urbanization. This study presents a useful new framework for green infrastructure (GI) planning for the management of urban runoff quality and quantity. The proposed framework considers physical, technical, economic, and multi-stakeholder aspects related to urban runoff management while simultaneously addressing the uncertainties of the decision-making process and model parameters. The methodology is applied to regionally locating and sizing low impact development-best management practices (LID-BMPs) while considering the hydrologic and hydraulic impacts. A decision-making multi-objective optimization framework is developed by integrating: 1) a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network founded on a Storm Water Management Model (SWMM-MLP meta-model), 2) NSGA-II multi-objective optimization, 3) fuzzy α-cut technique, and 4) a decision-making support model based on social choice theory to elicit trade-offs among system cost and LID-BMP performance indicators. The decision-making model, based on Fuzzy Social Choice (FSC) theory, is applied to simulate consensus between stakeholders for a partially cooperative group decision-making problem. The proposed methodology is explored in a catchment located in the northeastern part of Tehran, Iran. Results showed that the SWMM could be effectively replaced with a MLP-based meta-model in simulation-optimization problems for urban runoff management. In the application of FSC methods, the optimal scenarios were effective in reducing the volume of urban runoff and contamination loads while maintaining the optimality of the operation costs. Considering the optimal LID scenario, a reduction of more than 99% in runoff volume and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and a decrease of more than 92% of total suspended solids (TSS), occurred for the lower bound of uncertainty (lower (left) end of the α-cut = 0.3). For the upper bound of uncertainty (upper (right) end of the α-cut level = 0.3), a maximum reduction of 57% was obtained. In applying FSC methods through the decision-making process, the Borda Counting method considered the preferences of all stakeholders best. Moreover, the proposed framework allows decision-makers to decide on the acceptability and reliability of the optimal management scenarios considering their preferences and uncertainties.

N2  - The aim of this paper is to present a Total Power Quality Index (TPQI) for estimating Power Quality (PQ) at a specific site of the electric network using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodology techniques and a variety of methods from Machine Learning. The main advantage of this methodology is the avoidance of certain arbitrary parameters used in previous research efforts implementing a Fuzzy Index Model. For the purposes of this study and for the training process of the proposed ANN model additional data derived from Power Quality measurements along with an appropriate questionnaire which gathered the opinion of experts was used. The proposed methodology appeared to be flexible, reprogrammable with the capability to assimilate new measurements and estimations in any specific case study. The outcome of the proposed ANN model is compared with the corresponding previously introduced Fuzzy Index model over three different case studies, providing significant results for further improvement.

N2  - New product portfolio selection is a multi-criteria decision making problem including both qualitative and quantitative criteria. Determining the exact values for these criteria is often difficult or even impossible taking into account uncertainty and complexity associated with new product development projects. To assist managers in making portfolio selection decisions, this study proposes a new project portfolio selection model that uses a fuzzy weighted average approach for ranking new product projects and artificial neural networks for estimating project performance. New product development projects are evaluated according to criteria related to marketing, project team, project performance, risk, and strategy. The use of neural networks enables more precise evaluation of project performance criteria and provides additional information in portfolio selection. A case study of the evaluation of new product projects illustrates the usefulness of the proposed approach.

N2  - Many advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning are based on decision making, especially in uncertain settings. Due to its possible applications, decision making is currently a broad field of study in many areas like Computation, Economics and Business Management. The first techniques appeared in scenarios where information was modeled by real numbers. In all cases, one of the key steps in such processes was the summarization of the available information into a few values that helped the decision maker to complete this task. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-criteria decision making methodology in the fuzzy context in which weights and experts’ opinions (may be translated by linguistic labels) are stated as triangular fuzzy numbers. To do that, we take advantage of a recently presented fuzzy binary relation whose properties are according to human intuition and we carry out a study of the main properties that an aggregation function (a mapping to sum up information) must satisfy in the fuzzy framework. The presented procedure makes a final decision based on parabolic fuzzy numbers (not triangular). And this will be shown in an illustrative example.

N2  - Sustainable transport has become an important goal in transportation planning and research in recent decades. One emphasis of sustainable transport is to develop a multi-modal transportation system, in which bicycling facility planning is playing an important role. Recently, many bicycle facility planning methods have been proposed, and can be divided into two groups: supply- and demand-based models. While these two groups of models have been applied separately, few studies, however, have incorporated variables from these two groups of models together for bicycle facility planning. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) analysis to integrate both supply- and demand-based criteria for bicycle facility planning. Analysis was performed at two geographic levels: network level and neighborhood level, and a Geographic Information System (GIS) based exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) method was applied to explore the spatial patterns of bicycle facilities at the neighborhood level. This model was applied to Milwaukee City, WI, U.S.A., and results suggest that a combination of GIS and MCE analysis can serve as a better alternative to plan for optimal bicycle facilities, highlighting inadequacies of typical supply-side measures, and meet multiple planning objectives of government agencies, planners and bicyclists.

N2  - Rooted deeply in medical multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM), risk assessment is very important especially when applied to the risk of being affected by deadly diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD risk assessment is a stochastic, uncertain, and highly dynamic process influenced by various known and unknown variables. In recent years, there has been a great interest in fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), a popular methodology for dealing with uncertainty in MCDM. This paper proposes a new FAHP, bimodal fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (BFAHP) that augments two aspects of knowledge, probability and validity, to fuzzy numbers to better deal with uncertainty. In BFAHP, fuzzy validity is computed by aggregating the validities of relevant risk factors based on expert knowledge and collective intelligence. By considering both soft and statistical data, we compute the fuzzy probability of risk factors using the Bayesian formulation. In BFAHP approach, these fuzzy validities and fuzzy probabilities are used to construct a reciprocal comparison matrix. We then aggregate fuzzy probabilities and fuzzy validities in a pairwise manner for each risk factor and each alternative. BFAHP decides about being affected and not being affected by ranking of high and low risks. For evaluation, the proposed approach is applied to the risk of being affected by CHD using a real dataset of 152 patients of Iranian hospitals. Simulation results confirm that adding validity in a fuzzy manner can accrue more confidence of results and clinically useful especially in the face of incomplete information when compared with actual results. Applying the proposed BFAHP on CHD risk assessment of the dataset, it yields high accuracy rate above 85% for correct prediction. In addition, this paper recognizes that the risk factors of diastolic blood pressure in men and high-density lipoprotein in women are more important in CHD than other risk factors.

N2  - A Dynamic Manufacturing Network (DMN) is the manufacturing industry application of the Virtual Enterprise (VE) business model based on real time information sharing and process integration. DMNs are normally formed and supported by a collaborative platform previously designed and built by a preexisting strategic partnership. The collaborative platform forms and tracks each DMN through all phases of its life cycle which leads to the accumulation and storage of large historical datasets on partner and customer characteristics and actions. This data holds the key to customer and manufacturer behavioral patterns and performances that can further be used in the decision making processes. In this study, we have focused on tackling this widely neglected research opportunity, by integrating manufacturer, order and customer data and characteristics into DMN formation and planning. The developed big data analytics approach consists of TOPSIS, fuzzy inference system and multi objective optimization techniques. Initially, by integrating the TOPSIS multi criteria decision making technique with a fuzzy inference system (FIS) we have computed indices for Manufacturer reliability and Order priority. Then we developed a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to generate efficient solutions minimizing cost and assigning more reliable manufacturers to orders with higher priority.

N2  - The aim of this study is to introduce three models along with four methods for intuitionistic fuzzy analytical network process (IFANP) and discuss the conceptual framework of process management for maritime supply chain. For the first time, in this study, centric consistency index is employed for all individual and aggregated judgment matrices of both membership and non membership functions together or separately. Secondly, consistency prioritization for each expert is implemented for all aggregated judgment matrices. Chang’s extent analysis method and Gaussian approximation for IFANP method are firstly employed to IFANP. A comparison between the conventional version and proposed models of IFANP is provided. Process optimization for maritime industry is conducted by considering several perspectives including financial, technical, operational and safety concerns.

N2  - The assessment of biomass at high spatial resolution is critical to manage supply risks and to identify optimal plant sites for producing sustainable biofuels and co-products. The spatial variabilities in soil type, topography, climate, and crop management practices further require vast computational time and resources to estimate the availability of sustainable biomass for a large study area. In this study, we developed a GIS-based integrated predictive modeling platform to assess the availability of sustainable crop residues at high spatial (30 m) and temporal (2010–2022) scales. A GIS-based multi-criteria inclusion-exclusion analysis and facility location-allocation models were used to identify suitable sites, and optimal siting of biogas plants respectively with biomass delivered cost. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based predictive models were well suited to predict sustainability indicators (soil erosion SE- R2 = 0.96, soil conditioning index, SCI R2 = 0.98 and organic matter factor, OMF- R2 = 0.83) for assessing sustainable removal rates of crop residues (corn stover and wheat straw). The GIS-based integrated model was applied to the State of Ohio and found that about 4–13 dry Tg of crop residues can be sustainably available to build 1–25 regional biogas plants. A typical optimal biogas plant with a feedstock capacity of up to 500 dry Gg could be drawn from a transport radius of about 19–35 km with a delivered cost of 40–46 $ dry Mg−1. The temporal and spatial variations in assessing the availability of biomass largely affected the supply chain decisions and its delivered costs.

N2  - The more cloud providers in the market the more information users have to handle to choose the best and suitable option for their application or business. The diversity in cloud services is a challenge for automated decision making in the multi-cloud environment. These decisions become more complex when the application's requirements and the application owner's constraints need to be satisfied throughout the application life cycle.This paper presents the concept of an Adaptive Decision Making Broker (ADMB) for multi-cloud management. ADMB aims to provide multi-criteria decision making using machine learning in a multi-cloud environment. In this context, we believe that our proposed methodology has the potential to provide optimal solutions as well as handle trade-offs between the functional and the non-functional requirements of given application.

N2  - Existing Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) based communication suffers from various security and performance issues, hence Cluster based Communication is preferred nowadays. However, Cluster based Communication adds extra overhead and burden on the Cluster Head (CH) in dense network scenarios which eventually introduces delay and hinders network performance. To reduce the overburdening of single CH, a multi cluster head scheme is proposed in which multiple nodes in a cluster can act as CH to share the load of single CH. For a selection of stable CH, Hybrid Fuzzy Multi-criteria Decision making approach (HF-MCDM) is proposed in which Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and TOPSIS methods are clubbed together for optimal decision making. Further because of association of Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) with life-critical applications, there is a dire need for a security framework to detect various malevolent attacks. Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) like Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the approaches for curbing such attacks. These intrusion detection based mechanism can be combined with various existing optimization techniques to improve their performance, and Dolphin Swarm Algorithm is one such approach. Dolphins have many significant biological features like echolocation, exchange of information, coordination, and division of labor. These biological features combined with swarm intelligence can be utilized for optimizing the detection and accuracy of SVM based IDS. So in this paper, a Multi-Cluster Head anomaly based IDS optimized by Dolphin Swarm Algorithm has been proposed and its results are compared with various existing Security frameworks in terms of parameters like false positive, detection rate, detection time, etc. and it is observed that the proposed approach performs better.

N2  - A multi-criteria decision-making approach was used for the selection of GCMs for Nigeria based on their ability to replicate historical rainfall estimated using three entropy-based feature selection methods namely, Entropy Gain (EG), Gain Ratio (GR), and Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU). Performances of four bias correction methods were compared to identify the most suitable method for downscaling and projection of rainfall using the selected GCMs. Random forest (RF) regression was used for the generation of the multi-model ensemble (MME) average of projected rainfall. The ensemble projections for each of the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 were computed and compared with global precipitation climatology centre (GPCC) historical rainfall of Nigeria to assess the percentage changes in annual rainfall with 95% level of confidence at different ecological zones for three future periods 2010–2039, 2040–2069, and 2070–2099. Quantile regression was used to assess the changes in seasonal rainfall at 95% confidence interval over the present century. The results revealed that MRI-CGCM3, HadGEM2-ES, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 and CESM1-CAM5 are the most suitable GCMs for the projection of rainfall in Nigeria. The linear scaling method was found as the most suitable approach for downscaling of rainfall in terms of all the statistical indices used. It was found to downscale rainfall with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) in the range of 30.7–44.0%, while Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) was between 0.81 and 0.91, and modified coefficient of agreement (md) was between 0.82 and 0.88. Projection of rainfall showed no significant change in Nigeria over the century under RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 6.5, while RCP 8.5 showed a decrease in the last part of the century (2070–2099). The seasonal changes in rainfall showed an increase in rainfall in the range of 0–20% in most parts of the north. The methodology in this study can reduce the uncertainty inherent in climate change projection and produce better projection of possible spatial and temporal changes in annual and seasonal rainfall.

N2  - Growing world population along with fast economic growth and increased living standards have increased the municipal waste generation making its management be a foremost global issue. The problem is even more serious in urban areas as its improper management prompts tainting of soil, water, and environment which create public health risks. These problems of waste disposal and management were usually assessed by traditional methods which require loads of data. The recent development in the new software technologies and Internet along with the introduction of gradually more compact and dependable hardware products have presented the ability to accurately deal with these procedures more easily than costly and tedious field experiments. This paper presents an outline of the utilization of different scientific models in solving the environmental problems of municipal waste disposal. The examination of past literature uncovered that usually optimization models were used to find the answer of 'what is the best' under an explicit arrangement of conditions, while, simulation models were usually helpful to get an answer to 'what if? ' due to their predictive capability. An indication of the municipal waste disposal problems and its management alongside the ramifications of the investigation is provided. The rationale and backdrop of the waste disposal issues are described. The applications of optimization modeling, multi-objective approach, multi-criteria decision analysis, and artificial neural networks in waste management are presented and applications of these modeling techniques in diverse case studies worldwide are described. And finally, the conclusions of the analysis are summarized.

N2  - A number of practical optimization problems are posed as many-objective (more than three objectives) problems. Most of the existing evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms, which target the entire Pareto-front are not equipped to handle many-objective problems. Though there have been copious efforts to overcome the challenges posed by such problems, there does not exist a generic procedure to effectively handle them. This paper presents a simplify and solve framework for handling many-objective optimization problems. In that, a given problem is simplified by identification and elimination of the redundant objectives, before interactively engaging the decision maker to converge to the most preferred solution on the Pareto-optimal front. The merit of performing objective reduction before interacting with the decision maker is two fold. Firstly, the revelation that certain objectives are redundant, significantly reduces the complexity of the optimization problem, implying lower computational cost and higher search efficiency. Secondly, it is well known that human beings are not efficient in handling several factors (objectives in the current context) at a time. Hence, simplifying the problem a priori addresses the fundamental issue of cognitive overload for the decision maker, which may help avoid inconsistent preferences during the different stages of interactive engagement. The implementation of the proposed framework is first demonstrated on a three-objective problem, followed by its application on two real-world engineering problems.

N2  - Artificial neural networks have gone through a recent rise in popularity, achieving state-of-the-art results in various fields, including image classification, speech recognition, and automated control. Both the performance and computational complexity of such models are heavily dependant on the design of characteristic hyper-parameters (e.g., number of hidden layers, nodes per layer, or choice of activation functions), which have traditionally been optimized manually. With machine learning penetrating low-power mobile and embedded areas, the need to optimize not only for performance (accuracy), but also for implementation complexity, becomes paramount. In this work, we present a multi-objective design space exploration method that reduces the number of solution networks trained and evaluated through response surface modelling. Given spaces which can easily exceed 1020 solutions, manually designing a near-optimal architecture is unlikely as opportunities to reduce network complexity, while maintaining performance, may be overlooked. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that hyper-parameters which perform well on specific datasets may yield sub-par results on others, and must therefore be designed on a per-application basis. In our work, machine learning is leveraged by training an artificial neural network to predict the performance of future candidate networks. The method is evaluated on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets, optimizing for both recognition accuracy and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can closely approximate the Pareto-optimal front, while only exploring a small fraction of the design space.

N2  - Chromatography remains the workhorse in antibody purification; however process development and characterisation still require significant resources. The high number of operating parameters involved requires extensive experimentation, traditionally performed at small- and pilot-scale, leading to demands in terms of materials and time that can be a challenge. The main objective of this research was the establishment of a novel High Throughput Process Development (HTPD) workflow combining scale-down chromatography experimentation with advanced decision-support techniques in order to minimise the consumption of resources and accelerate the development timeframe. Additionally, the HTPD workflow provides a framework to rapidly manipulate large datasets in an automated fashion. The central component of the HTPD workflow is the systematic integration of a microscale chromatography experimentation strategy with an advanced chromatogram evaluation method, design of experiments (DoE) and multivariate data analysis. The outputs of this are leveraged into the screening and optimisation components of the workflow. For the screening component, a decision-support tool was developed combining different multi-criteria decision-making techniques to enable a fair comparison of a number of CEX resin candidates and determine those that demonstrate superior purification performance. This provided a rational methodology for screening chromatography resins and process parameters. For the optimisation component, the workflow leverages insights provided through screening experimentation to guide subsequent DoE experiments so as to tune significant process parameters for the selected resin. The resulting empirical correlations are linked to a stochastic modelling technique so as to predict the optimal and most robust chromatographic process parameters to achieve the desired performance criteria.

N2  - This paper describes the development of ad hoc methodology for determination of inorganic anions in oilfield water, since their composition often significantly differs from the average (concentration of components and/or matrix). Therefore, fast and reliable method development has to be performed in order to ensure the monitoring of desired properties under new conditions. The method development was based on computer assisted multi-criteria decision making strategy. The used criteria were: maximal value of objective functions used, maximal robustness of the separation method, minimal analysis time, and maximal retention distance between two nearest components. Artificial neural networks were used for modeling of anion retention. The reliability of developed method was extensively tested by the validation of performance characteristics. Based on validation results, the developed method shows satisfactory performance characteristics, proving the successful application of computer assisted methodology in the described case study.

N2  - The purpose of spatial modelling in animal and public health is three-fold: describing existing spatial patterns of risk, attempting to understand the biological mechanisms that lead to disease occurrence and predicting what will happen in the medium to long-term future (temporal prediction) or in different geographical areas (spatial prediction). Traditional methods for temporal and spatial predictions include general and generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM) and Bayesian estimation methods. However, such models require both disease presence and absence data which are not always easy to obtain. Novel spatial modelling methods such as maximum entropy (MAXENT) and the genetic algorithm for rule set production (GARP) require only disease presence data and have been used extensively in the fields of ecology and conservation, to model species distribution and habitat suitability. Other methods, such as multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), use knowledge of the causal factors of disease occurrence to identify areas potentially suitable for disease. In addition to their less restrictive data requirements, some of these novel methods have been shown to outperform traditional statistical methods in predictive ability (Elith et al., 2006). This review paper provides details of some of these novel methods for mapping disease distribution, highlights their advantages and limitations, and identifies studies which have used the methods to model various aspects of disease distribution.

N2  - In this paper, we introduce new methods for multiobjective, system-level optimization that have been incorporated into the Lightweight Dataflow for Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) Environment (LiD4E). LiD4E is a design tool for optimized implementation of dynamic, data-driven stream mining systems using high-level dataflow models of computation. More specifically, we develop in this paper new methods for integrated modeling and optimization of real-time stream mining constraints, multidimensional stream mining performance (precision and recall), and energy efficiency. Using a design methodology centered on data-driven control of and coordination between alternative dataflow subsystems for stream mining (classification modes), we develop systematic methods for exploring complex, multidimensional design spaces associated with dynamic stream mining systems, and deriving sets of Pareto-optimal system configurations that can be switched among based on data characteristics and operating constraints.

N2  - Supplier evaluation and selection constitutes a central issue in supply chain management (SCM). However, the data on which to base the corresponding choices in real life problems are often imprecise or vague, which has led to the introduction of fuzzy approaches. Predictive intelligent-based techniques, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), have been recently applied in different research fields to model fuzzy multi-criteria decision processes where the understanding and learning of the relationships between the input and output data are the key to select suitable solutions. In this paper, a hybrid ANFIS-ANN model is proposed to assist managers in their supplier evaluation process. After aggregating the data set through the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), the most influential criteria on the suppliers’ performance are determined by ANFIS. Then, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to predict and rank the suppliers’ performance based on the most effective criteria. A case study is presented to illustrate the main steps of the model and show its accuracy in prediction. A battery of parametric tests and sensitivity analyses has been implemented to evaluate the overall performance of several models based on different effective criteria combinations.

N2  - Graphical information (visualized data, information, and knowledge generated from different investigations and experimentations) is a useful form of decision-relevant information in all fields of study. The usages of such information are expected to increase exponentially due to the advent of big data. Unfortunately, there are no formal methods available for directly computing the graphical information generated from big data while making a decision. This study fills this gap and presents a fuzzy logic based method, as well as a decision support tool, to perform multiple criteria decision making by directly computing the graphical information generated from big data. The effectiveness of the proposed method and tool is demonstrated by conducting a case study. Further study can be carried out to see the implication of this study in making formal decisions aided by the big data.

N2  - Controlled shot peening process is performed on two independent ways: (1) Pre-shot peening of Almen strips to determine the desired intensity (2) Shot peening of the real sample with the Almen intensity obtained. Shot peening of Almen strips in the first step takes more time. This is because, the application of input parameters, also measuring arc height and controlling the Almen intensity stages have to be completed consecutively. The results influence the real sample characteristics directly. Still, the arc height measurements and the input parameters adjustment depend on technicians’ expertness. So, numerical approaches by conducting finite element modelling (FEM), ANN (artificial neural network) and RSM (response surface methodology) takes more attention growingly. For this purpose, another numerical approach, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods have been developed and verified among their counterparts and also by comparing the experimental results, surface roughness and surface hardness in this study. The results show that the MCDM methods are consistent within themselves and in the context of input parameters (air pressure, shot size, peening duration) and output parameters (surface hardness, surface roughness). The Topsis approach presents consistent results with compared to both the other approaches and the experimental conditions.

N2  - Abstract This paper considers the statistical analysis of entomological count data from field experiments with genetically modified (GM) plants. Such trials are carried out to assess environmental safety. Potential effects on nontarget organisms (NTOs), as indicators of biodiversity, are investigated. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gives broad guidance on the environmental risk assessment (ERA) of GM plants. Field experiments must contain suitable comparator crops as a benchmark for the assessment of designated endpoints. In this paper, a detailed protocol is proposed to perform data analysis for the purpose of assessing environmental safety. The protocol includes the specification of a list of endpoints and their hierarchical relations, the specification of intended levels of data analysis, and the specification of provisional limits of concern to decide on the need for further investigation. The protocol emphasizes a graphical representation of estimates and confidence intervals for the ratio of mean abundances for the GM plant and its comparator crop. Interpretation relies mainly on equivalence testing in which confidence intervals are compared with the limits of concern. The proposed methodology is illustrated with entomological count data resulting from multiyear, multilocation field trials. A cisgenically modified potato line (with enhanced resistance to late blight disease) was compared to the original conventional potato variety in the Netherlands and Ireland in two successive years (2013, 2014). It is shown that the protocol encompasses alternative schemes for safety assessment resulting from different research questions and/or expert choices. Graphical displays of equivalence testing at several hierarchical levels and their interpretation are presented for one of these schemes. The proposed approaches should be of help in the ERA of GM or other novel plants.

N2  - The Social Web is characterized by a massive diffusion of unfiltered content, directly generated by users via the spread of different social media platforms. In this context, a challenging issue is to assess the veracity of the information generated within the sites of online reviews. To address this issue, a common practice in the literature is to select and analyze some veracity features associated with users and their reviews, by mostly applying machine learning techniques, to provide a classification in genuine and deceptive reviews. In this paper, we do not focus on the feature selection and user behavior analysis issues, but we concentrate on the aggregation process with respect to each single veracity feature. In most of the approaches based on machine learning techniques, the contribution of each feature in the classification process is not measurable by the user. For this reason, we propose a multicriteria decision making approach based both on the assessment of multiple criteria and the use of aggregation operators with the aim of obtaining a veracity score associated with each review. Based on this score, it is possible to detect fake reviews. The proposed model is evaluated on a Yelp data set by applying different aggregation schemes, and it is compared with well-known supervised machine learning techniques.

N2  - Water quality assessment entails essentially a multi-criteria decision-making process accounting for qualitative and quantitative uncertainties and their transformation. Considering uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness in water quality evaluation, a cloud model-based assessment approach is proposed. The cognitive cloud model, derived from information science, can realize the transformation between qualitative concept and quantitative data, based on probability and statistics and fuzzy set theory. When applying the cloud model to practical assessment, three technical issues are considered before the development of a complete cloud model-based approach: (1) bilateral boundary formula with nonlinear boundary regression for parameter estimation, (2) hybrid entropy-analytic hierarchy process technique for calculation of weights, and (3) mean of repeated simulations for determining the degree of final certainty. The cloud model-based approach is tested by evaluating the eutrophication status of 12 typical lakes and reservoirs in China and comparing with other four methods, which are Scoring Index method, Variable Fuzzy Sets method, Hybrid Fuzzy and Optimal model, and Neural Networks method. The proposed approach yields information concerning membership for each water quality status which leads to the final status. The approach is found to be representative of other alternative methods and accurate.

N2  - This paper presents an efficiency assessment of the 114 Islamic banks from 24 countries using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). TOPSIS is a multicriteria decision making technique similar to Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which ranks a finite set of units based on the minimization of distance from an ideal point and the maximization of distance from an anti-ideal point. In this research, TOPSIS is used first in a two-stage approach to assess the relative efficiency of Islamic banks using the most frequent indicators adopted by the literature. Then, in the second stage, neural networks are combined with TOPSIS results as part of an attempt to produce a model for banking performance with effective predictive ability. The results reveal that variables related to both country origin and cost structure have a prominent impact on efficiency. Findings also indicate that the Islamic banking market would benefit from higher level of competition between institutions.

N2  - Abstract This paper presents an efficiency assessment of the Angolan banks using Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-making technique similar to data envelopment analysis, which ranks a finite set of units based on the minimisation of distance from an ideal point and the maximisation of distance from an anti-ideal point. In this research, TOPSIS is used first in a two-stage approach to assess the relative efficiency of Angolan banks using the most frequent indicators adopted by the literature. Then, in the second stage, neural networks are combined with TOPSIS results as part of an attempt to produce a model for banking performance with effective predictive ability. The results reveal that variables related to cost structure have a prominent negative impact on efficiency. Findings also indicate that the Angolan banking market would benefit from higher level of competition between institutions.

N2  - The quality of data analysis and modeling is dependent on its inputs and statistical analysis is of limited value with inappropriate data. This paper proposes a framework for assessing data quality using the example of airport surface safety, i.e. runway/taxiway safety. The nature of airport surface safety is such that there is a need to account for data from a number of stakeholders, who may possess databases differing in quality, and aggregate this data for subsequent analysis to provide robust safety assessment and mitigation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a framework for the validation of external data quality based on the underlying data collection and investigation processes. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) using a linear model is applied to derive quantitative weights for twelve safety databases based on the quality of the underlying organizational data collection and investigation processes. The model takes eleven criteria in relation to possible error sources during data gathering and pre-processing, organizational safety culture, data accessibility, and the consistency of the reporting system over time into account. These weights combined with an internal data quality validation and an indication of the reporting level of an organization can give a robust indication of the quality of a database. This method is recommended for use for data quality assessments in aviation safety.

N2  - Extracting interesting tuples from a large database is an important problem in multi-criteria decision making. Two representative queries were proposed in the literature: top- k queries and skyline queries. A top- k query requires users to specify their utility functions beforehand and then returns k tuples to the users. A skyline query does not require any utility function from users but it puts no control on the number of tuples returned to users. Recently, a k-regret query was proposed and received attention from the community because it does not require any utility function from users and the output size is controllable, and thus it avoids those deficiencies of top- k queries and skyline queries. Specifically, it returns k tuples that minimize a criterion called the maximum regret ratio .In this paper, we present the lower bound of the maximum regret ratio for the k -regret query. Besides, we propose a novel algorithm, called SPHERE, whose upper bound on the maximum regret ratio is asymptotically optimal and restriction-free for any dimensionality, the best-known result in the literature. We conducted extensive experiments to show that SPHERE performs better than the state-of-the-art methods for the k -regret query.

N2  - ABSTRACT The need for high-concentration formulations for subcutaneous delivery of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can present manufacturability challenges for the final ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) step. Viscosity levels and the propensity to aggregate are key considerations for high-concentration formulations. This work presents novel frameworks for deriving a set of manufacturability indices related to viscosity and thermostability to rank high-concentration mAb formulation conditions in terms of their ease of manufacture. This is illustrated by analyzing published high-throughput biophysical screening data that explores the influence of different formulation conditions (pH, ions, and excipients) on the solution viscosity and product thermostability. A decision tree classification method, CART (Classification and Regression Tree) is used to identify the critical formulation conditions that influence the viscosity and thermostability. In this work, three different multi-criteria data analysis frameworks were investigated to derive manufacturability indices from analysis of the stress maps and the process conditions experienced in the final UF/DF step. Polynomial regression techniques were used to transform the experimental data into a set of stress maps that show viscosity and thermostability as functions of the formulation conditions. A mathematical filtrate flux model was used to capture the time profiles of protein concentration and flux decay behavior during UF/DF. Multi-criteria decision-making analysis was used to identify the optimal formulation conditions that minimize the potential for both viscosity and aggregation issues during UF/DF. Biotechnol.

N2  - The effect of online reviews on resulting decisions attracted the interests of merchants and researchers in different fields. According to existing studies, the decisions of tourists are highly likely modified after browsing online reviews from other travelers on a tourism website. The manner in which online reviews on tourism websites are utilized to select hotels and support tourists is a noteworthy research problem. Online reviews of a hotel are provided by various tourists with respect to different criteria; thus, each tourist is regarded as a decision-maker. In this instance, the problem of hotel selection is based on online reviews in a tourism website and is expressed as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. In this study, a mathematical model was designed to select appropriate hotels on websites. First, a new comparison method for linguistic distribution assessments was proposed based on linguistic scale functions. Second, a novel distance measurement between linguistic distribution assessments with different numbers of linguistic terms was defined with an adjustable parameter. Third, a model for calculating weights and a mathematical model were constructed according to the idea of prioritized aggregation operator and distance measurement. Finally, a case study of TripAdvisor.com was conducted to select suitable hotels using online reviews of hotels. Data analysis was completed to prove the viability of the designed model.

N2  - Application of super-insulating materials in building glazing system shows promising prospects for low-energy buildings. In this research, the heat transfer, solar radiation transmission and indoor illuminance of an aerogel glazing system were characterized through an experimentally validated numerical model. Contribution ratios of multi-variables to multi-objectives were thereafter quantified, following the Taguchi standard orthogonal array. In respect to the application of aerogel glazing system in subtropical climates, an energy-related contradiction between indoor illuminance from solar and indoor heat gain, has been presented, discussed, together with effective solutions. In order to minimise the total heat gain and maximise the indoor illuminance transmitted through the aerogel glazing system, a generic multi-objective optimisation methodology, with high computational efficiency and accuracy, has been developed, to identify the optimal design. The results indicate that through the Pareto front from the multi-objective optimisation results, a significant reduction of total heat gain and an obvious increase of the indoor illuminance can be noticed. Compared to the optimal case in the standard orthogonal array, with the application of the proposed multi-objective optimisation methodology, the annual total heat gain could be reduced from 489305.5 to 333396.4 Wh by 31.9% and the annual indoor illuminance could be increased from 56786.6 to 172973.5 lux by 67.2%. The year-round performance indicates that, compared to the bi-objective optimisation (annual transmitted heat gain and annual indoor illuminance) with the annual total heat gain at 333.4 kWh/m2 and annual indoor illuminance at 162.3 klux, the bi-objective optimisation (annual total heat gain and annual indoor illuminance) shows a lower annual total heat gain at 322.4 kWh/m2 by 3.4%) and a higher annual indoor illuminance at 173 klux by 6.6%. This study proposes an overall framework and technical guidance of a new multi-objective optimisation methodology, which can automatically learn mechanisms of heat transfer and solar radiation transmittance through nanoporous aerogel granules, and identify the optimal multi-variables setting for the robust system design and operation.
