N2  - Background: Sleep plays an essential role in repairing and healing human mental and physical health. Developing an efficient method for scoring electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep stages is expected to help medical specialists in the early diagnosis of sleep disorders. Method: In this paper, a novel technique is proposed for classifying sleep stages EEG signals using correlation graphs. First, each 30 s EEG segment is divided into a set of sub-segments. The dimensionality of each sub-segment is reduced by using a statistical model. Second, each EEG segment is transferred into a graph considering each sub-segment as a node in a graph, and a link between each pair of nodes is calculated based on their correlation coefficient. Graph's modularity is used as input features into an ensemble classifier. Results: Different community detection algorithm based correlation graph are investigated to discern the most effective features to reveal the differences between EEG sleep stages. A combination of various classification techniques: a least square vector machine (LS-SVM), k-means, Naïve Bayes, Fuzzy C-means, k-nearest, and logistic regression are tested using multi criteria decision making (MCDM) to design an ensemble classifier. Based on the results of the MCDM, the best four: LS-SVM, Naïve Bayes, logistic regression and k-nearest are integrated, to finally utilise as an ensemble classifier to categorise the graph's characteristics. The results obtained from the ensemble classifier are compared with those from the individual classifiers. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state of the art of sleep stages classification. The experimental results showed that the EEG sleep classification based on correlation graphs are able to achieve better recognition results than the existing state of the art techniques.

N2  - Abstract We present a method to learn the criteria weights in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) by applying emerging learning-to-rank machine learning techniques. Given the pairwise preferences by a decision maker (DM), we learn the weights that the DM attaches to the multiple criteria, characterizing each alternative. As the training information, our method requires the pairwise preferences of alternatives, as revealed by the DM. Once, the DM's decision model is learnt in terms of the criteria weights, it can be applied to predict his choices for any new set of alternatives. The empirical validation of the proposed approach is done on a collection of 12 standard datasets. The accuracy values are compared with those obtained for the state-of-the-art methods such as ranking-SVM and TOPSIS.

N2  - Forestry science has a long tradition of studying the relationship between stand productivity and abiotic and biotic site characteristics, such as climate, topography, soil and vegetation. Many of the early site quality modelling studies related site index to environmental variables using basic statistical methods such as linear regression. Because most ecological variables show a typical non-linear course and a non-constant variance distribution, a large fraction of the variation remained unexplained by these linear models. More recently, the development of more advanced non-parametric and machine learning methods provided opportunities to overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, these methods also have drawbacks. Due to their increasing complexity they are not only more difficult to implement and interpret, but also more vulnerable to overfitting. Especially in a context of regionalisation, this may prove to be problematic. Although many non-parametric and machine learning methods are increasingly used in applications related to forest site quality assessment, their predictive performance has only been assessed for a limited number of methods and ecosystems. In this study, five different modelling techniques are compared and evaluated, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), generalized additive models (GAM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Each method is used to model site index of homogeneous stands of three important tree species of the Taurus Mountains (Turkey): Pinus brutia, Pinus nigra and Cedrus libani. Site index is related to soil, vegetation and topographical variables, which are available for 167 sample plots covering all important environmental gradients in the research area. The five techniques are compared in a multi-criteria decision analysis in which different model performance measures, ecological interpretability and user-friendliness are considered as criteria. When combining these criteria, in most cases GAM is found to outperform all other techniques for modelling site index for the three species. BRT is a good alternative in case the ecological interpretability of the technique is of higher importance. When user-friendliness is more important MLR and CART are the preferred alternatives. Despite its good predictive performance, ANN is penalized for its complex, non-transparent models and big training effort. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods use normalization techniques to allow aggregation of criteria with numerical and comparable data. With the advent of Cyber Physical Systems, where big data is collected from heterogeneous sensors and other data sources, finding a suitable normalization technique is also a challenge to enable data fusion (integration). Therefore, data fusion and aggregation of criteria are similar processes of combining values either from criteria or from sensors to obtain a common score. In this study, our aim is to discuss metrics for assessing which are the most appropriate normalization techniques in decision problems, specifically for the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) multi-criteria method. AHP uses a pairwise approach to evaluate the alternatives regarding a set of criteria and then fuses (aggregation) the evaluations to determine the final ratings (scores).

N2  - A critical part when a company targeting a foreign market is how to make a better decision in connection with potential project selection. Since different attributes of information are often incomplete, imprecise and ill-defined in overseas projects selection, the process of decision making by relying on the experiences and intuition is a risky attitude. This paper aims to demonstrate a decision support method in deciding overseas construction projects (OCPs). An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), the amalgamation of Neural Network and Fuzzy Theory, was used as decision support tool to decide to go or not go on OCPs. Root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of correlation (R) were employed to identify the ANFIS system indicating an optimum and efficient result. The optimum result was obtained from ANFIS network with two input membership functions, Gaussian membership function (gaussmf) and hybrid optimization method. The result shows that ANFIS may help the decision-making process for go/not go decision in OCPs.

N2  - This study presents an efficient multimaterial design optimization algorithm that is suitable for nonlinear structures. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps: conceptual design generation, design characterization by machine learning, and metamodel-based multi-objective optimization. The conceptual design can be generated from extracting finite element analysis information or by using structure optimization. The conceptual design is then characterized by using machine learning techniques to dramatically reduce the dimension of the design space. Finally, metamodels are derived using Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) followed by multi-objective design optimization to find the optimal material distribution. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using examples from multiple physics and compared with traditional multimaterial topology optimization method.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to incorporate prior knowledge in the artificial neural network (ANN) model for the prediction of continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagram of steel, so that the model predictions become valid from materials engineering point of view. Design/methodology/approach: Genetic algorithm (GA) is used in different ways for incorporating system knowledge during training the ANN. In case of training, the ANN in multi-objective optimization mode, with prediction error minimization as one objective and the system knowledge incorporation as the other, the generated Pareto solutions are different ANN models with better performance in at least one objective. To choose a single model for the prediction of steel transformation, different multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) concepts are employed. To avoid the problem of choosing a single model from the non-dominated Pareto solutions, the training scheme also converted into a single objective optimization problem. Findings: The prediction results of the models trained in multi and single objective optimization schemes are compared. It is seen that though conversion of the problem to a single objective optimization problem reduces the complexity, the models trained using multi-objective optimization are found to be better for predicting metallurgically justifiable result. Originality/value: ANN is being used extensively in the complex materials systems like steel. Several works have been done to develop ANN models for the prediction of CCT diagram. But the present work proposes some methods to overcome the inherent problem of data-driven model, and make the prediction viable from the system knowledge.

N2  - Effective evaluating environmental performance of a machining system is critical for continuous environmental improvement and a long-term survival of intense competition. Manufacturers face difficulties during the environmental performance evaluating process due to vague and subjective considerations. To help enterprises economically and effectively improve environmental performance, a new method for evaluating environmental performance of a machining system is presented. In this method, a multi-criteria decision-making technique (analytical hierarchy process) is employed to set baselines for environmental performance evaluation, and a back-propagation neural network is used to express the preferences and knowledge of the decision makers about the evaluating problems. An illustrative example is used to illustrate how the assessment method may be applied and to demonstrate its applicability. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Cloud is generally used as an alternative options that provide an on - demand services to customer and to extends their requirement with the several services published in cloud as well as without the concern of cost and security management, especially, in the era of big data. However, the growing number of available services causes an increasing in the number of similar services, furthermore, the only single service resource cannot complete the requirement from user. Therefore, it is an important to issue the composition service. To composite services together, the need of method to evaluate and select the best service candidate from the service's pool called service selection is vital. In the process of extraction the appropriate candidate, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), one of the most popular techniques of the Multi - Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is mostly used to evaluate in multiple criteria situation. The Quality of Service (QoS) which is a numeric value available in each service is applied with AHP to resolve the problem of non-functional service selection. A result of this review indicates that the QoS based service selection with AHP can efficiency support the service evaluation and selection process. Moreover, it can be focus on applying other algorithms to enhance the performance of service selecting in cloud for a future work.

N2  - Novel technologies can reduce the overall cost in management and/or prevention of illnesses. Since the increased capability of access to high-speed internet and use of smartphones, the use of software or applications (apps) to manage health needs is continuously increasing among patients. The smart devices using these technologies can monitor and track the health of patients in real time. The generated data from these devices are mostly wasted or remains vastly under-utilized. The recent rise in predictive analytics and big data sets to augment the growth of smart medical devices. This brings the question of how to find the best big data vendor for smart medical devices industry. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) is one of the tools, which might be used to assist decision makers (DMs) to assess big data vendors for smart medical devices under different evaluation criteria. Hence, this paper explores how to find the best big data vendor by an MCDM approach, namely TODIM (Portuguese: Tomada de Decisão Interativa Multicritério). This paper also uses the Intuitionistic Fuzzy objective world environment, which is characterized by the degree of membership, non-membership, and hesitancy to describe uncertain information more comprehensively. A case study based on smart medical devices is used to identify the best alternative. The paper is concluded by providing the criteria set for big data vendor selection and research areas for future research.

N2  - In multi-objective decision making problems, multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithms aim to approximate the Pareto frontier uniformly. A naive approach is to learn multiple policies by repeatedly running a single-objective reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm on scalarized rewards. The scalarization methods denote the preferences of objectives, which are different in each run. However, in this way, the model representation and computation are redundant. Furthermore, uniform preferences can not guarantee a uniformly approximated Pareto frontier. To address these problems and leverage the expressive power of deep neural networks, we propose a two-stage MORL framework integrating a multi-policy deep RL algorithm and an evolution strategy algorithm. Firstly, a multi-policy soft actor-critic algorithm is proposed to collaboratively learn multiple policies which are assigned with different scalarization weights. The lower layers of all policy networks are shared. The first-stage learning can be regarded as representation learning. Secondly, the multi-objective covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (MO-CMA-ES) is applied to fine-tune policy-independent parameters to approach a dense and uniform estimation of the Pareto frontier. Experimental results on two benchmarks (Deep Sea Treasure and Adaptive Streaming) show the superiority of the proposed method.

N2  - With the continuous expansion of the computer system application field, the complexity of software system is also improving. Software defect detection has gradually become an important research direction in the field of software engineering. At present, the mixed statistics and machine learning methods have been proved to be able to implement software defect detection models well. However, the evaluation index of the detection model is diverse and it is difficult to determine which model evaluation indicators are in line with the actual expectations. Aiming at this kind of problem, a software defect detection model evaluation method based on fuzzy multi-objective attribute decision making is proposed. First, extract the characteristics of software modules, use McCabe and Halstead software modules to measure attributes. Then select five common classification algorithms to establish software defect detection models, and obtain seven evaluation index values of each model. Further, based on fuzzy multi-objective attribute decision making method with fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to compare multiple objectives, and obtain the results of index determination. Finally, the fuzzy evaluation algorithm is used to convert the evaluation index of qualitative evaluation into quantitative evaluation to obtain the final decision evaluation value. The experimental results show the effectiveness and practicality of the method.

N2  - Internet of Things (IoT) played a significant role in Healthcare. One of the major challenges in IoT health is security. For this reason, regarding the past studies, there is a lack of a comprehensive security framework that encompasses all layers of IoT. This article offers a security framework with four layers of sensor, network, service, and application. These layers help to develop security mechanisms within the proposed framework by providing security solutions. Also, security improvement has been influenced by the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique. To evaluate this framework, a conceptual model was defined with six critical criteria including security, network, services, interoperability, privacy, and reliability. The validity and reliability of this conceptual model were analyzed using SPSS 24 and AMOS 18. After proving the important criteria in the proposed model, we used the MCDM process of fuzzy analytic network process to prioritize the important criteria. The evaluation results of the conceptual model in the proposed framework, after analyzing the routes, show the validity of the proposed criteria. Therefore, in this model, 8 out of 12 communication routes between the criteria have a positive and significant relationship and 4 routes do not. The results of prioritizing important criteria in the research model, using analytic network process method, show that the network criterion, and authentication and validation sub-criteria have the highest priority among the proposed criteria. Thus, it can be decided that security solutions in the network layer and authentication and validation sub-criteria help to develop the proposed security framework.

N2  - Functional clothing are actually engineered textiles as they require to meet the stringent performance characteristics rather than the aesthetic properties. Therefore, the trial and error approach of product design does not seem to be a viable way for functional clothing. It needs more potent approaches of modelling, optimization and decision making so that the design and functional requirements of clothing can be met with acceptable tolerance. This paper provides a brief outline of various techniques of modelling, optimization and decision making intended for designing of functional clothing. In the modelling part, regression and artificial neural network approaches have been discussed with the examples of thermal property and water repellency modelling. Subsequently, linear programming and genetic algorithm techniques have been invoked in the optimization part. Optimization of ultraviolet radiation protective clothing is taken up as a case study. Finally, multi-criteria decision making techniques have been explained with the hypothetical example of selection of best body armour vest for defense applications.

N2  - Coreference resolution has been an active field of research in the past several decades and plays a vital role in many areas such as information extraction, document summarization, machine translation, and question answering systems. This paper presents a new coreference resolution approach by incorporating RoBERTa embedding with a neural multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. The proposed model does not use any syntactic and dependency parser. Mentions were extracted from the text with an unhand engineered mention detector and features were extracted from a deep neural network. Next, the problem is modeled in the form of effective parameters of the performance such as error rate reduction and enhances the F1 by Kohonen MCDM neural network. The weights assigned to the features represent their importance and suggests the best reference for a mention where such weights are computed using a fuzzy weighting method. Comparing to state-of-the-art coreference resolution models, the simulation results show significant improvements for the proposed approach on different datasets in terms of precision and recall and achieving marginal improvements on the following datasets: English CoNLL-2012 shared task (+3.1 F1), Yahoo’s news site (+6.6 F1), and English Gigaword (+7.04).

N2  - Industry 4.0 can be defined as a creative manufacturing concept which is the integration of up-to-date technologies such as wireless systems, cyberphysical systems, Internet of things, cloud computing, big data concept to increase flexibility, and speed in production systems. The concept also aims to transform the manufacturing industry into the next generation. Selection among appropriate strategies for transition to industry 4.0 is crucial and should be considered in a multidimensional perspective since the decision process involves many strategies with respect to multicriteria based on the judgments of multiexperts. In this paper, this critical decision has been considered as a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem under the uncertainty and vagueness environments. To increase the applicability of the uncertain data for the proposed methodology, intuitionistic fuzzy sets have been adopted. In other words, an integrated fuzzy MCDM methodology consists of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution has been suggested to prioritize of transition strategies for industry 4.0. According to proposed approach, “Training and continuing professional development” is determined as the most important strategy during the transition process, while “Technology” and “Equipment and Tools” are specified as the most crucial main and sub-criterion, respectively. For the validation process, we also applied two distance-based methods on the same decision matrices as a comparative analysis. Both analyses’ results yield that the proposed methodology is applicable and effective for the decision-making process. Besides, the results of the one-at-a-time sensitivity analyses based on the changes of main criteria weights confirm the sensitivity and flexibility of the proposed methodology. Finally, a road map for transition to industry 4.0 has been determined with respect to priorities of strategies based on the constructed context.

N2  - Currently, plenty topics in terms of the physical support technologies and the market operating technologies of integrated energy services (IESs) have been researched. It is obvious that a number of remarkable contributions related to the physical support technologies of IESs can be identified. However, few valuable conclusions of the market operating technologies can be summarized, which significantly prevents the IESs in China from being developed with marketization and scalability. Therefore, this paper focused on the synergetic development of the energy internet (EI) and the IESs, which analyzes the promotional effects of the EI for serving the scalability of IESs from three aspects including the organizational form of market, the business model of service providers, and the digital strategy of business process. Moreover, this paper further researched and discussed the market operating models of IESs and matching technologies. Three detailed works done by this paper were presented as, the first one was based on the trends of the market maturity level and the transparency of relevant information, the development of IESs market in China was divided into three phases including the unorganized phase of decentralized competitive market, the locally plat-formalized phase of information aggregation, and the global ecological phase of industrial eco-management. In each phase, the organizational form of market considering the participations of the energy service providers, the information operators, and the platform of IESs were established. The second one was based on the individual-valued property and the operating procedure of the aforementioned three market participants, a business model was constructed in terms of satisfying the energy users' diversified demands, linking the supply and requisitioning parties to close the deal, and guiding the behaviors of the variousmarket participants. The third one was the model theories and the technology frameworks of four key technologies of the market operating models of IESs were designed, including: 1) the energy users' multi-level portrait model with considering the energy-consumption- behavior characteristics, the energy-demand characteristics, and the service potentialities of which were achieved based on the big data analytic, cloud computing, and the Internet of things (IOT) was presented; 2) the energy service providers' comprehensive portrait technology through the establishment of an evaluation index system covering the three aspects of enterprise strength, service capabilities and service products of which were achieved based on the Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, the data envelope analysis, and the integrated weigh was presented; 3) the accurate market portrait technology which analyze and predict the supply and demand trends in the future, influencing factors and changing laws of various service products and service markets was presented. Besides, according to the functional characteristics of market subjects, the idea of short term market potential assessment method which suitable for energy service providers and information operators, and the idea to analyze the trend of mid long term market trend which suitable for the platform of IESs were illustrated respectively; 4) the proactive push strategy for IESs based on the multi-criteria decision-making, as well as the service recommendation strategy forthe stage of information aggregation and industrial ecological which based on the theoretical method were presented. At last, a number of suggestions of serving future researches, practices and policy decisions were put forward from the aspects of the promotions of the concentration and the openness of the market, the guidance and the cultivation of the energy consumption behavior of users in the demand side, and the improvements of the ability to obtain energy data and the data processing capacities. Summarizing, the development of the EI will innovate the traditional energy service supply and demand model, and reshape the format of IESs. It is necessary to carry out more extensive research and practical work in terms of market operation models and technologies in the future which will contribute to realize large-scale development of IESs.

N2  - The aim of this paper is to investigate the ability of artificial neural network (ANN) models for post-processing the monthly precipitation forecasts under North American multi-model ensemble (NMME) project and proposing a new multi-model ensemble neural network (MME-NN) model. Monthly precipitation hindcasts of eight models from NMME project are considered in this study. Multi-layer perceptron neural networks are employed for post-processing the output of the models in comparison with PERSIANN-CDR climatology data. Also, utilizing a multi-criteria decision-making approach, NMME models are ranked for each month. The study is implemented over Iran and detailed discussions are provided. The results indicate that the skill of NMME models is different for each month and for each region of the country. Also, it is shown that the neural network outperforms all NMME models for all months. By using the ranking of the models, for each month, the NMME models are ordered based on their skill and a monthly rank is devoted for each model.

N2  - Location selection problems stand out as popular research topics. Due to the popularity, different solution approaches emerged in the literature. Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques are examples of the solution approaches and they are frequently used because of their ordering capability in ranking the decision alternatives and success in representing decision makers’ experiences. On the other hand, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is able to perform different spatial data analysis and provide geographic material. To reach a better decision, integration of experts’ opinions and certain geographic information derived from GIS is necessary. Within this context, in this paper, integration of the GIS abilities with Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) is discussed with two different integration methodologies for locating a single facility. A hypothetical case study is provided to determine a location problem, which focuses on logistics activities. The results have shown that both proposed methodologies are able to order location alternatives in multiple criteria environments.

N2  - Background: Health economists have shown a growing interest in deliberation and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) as possible pathways to transparently integrate value judgments in cost-utility analyses. In line with these developments, this study piloted a consensus process to derive a German value set for the Short-Form Six-Dimension (SF-6D). In a conference setting, a group was tasked to deliberate on scores and weights for the SF-6D from the perspective of a self-determined and independent life. Methods: The one-day consensus conference was based on a deliberative process in combination with the MCDA method MACBETH (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique). According to MACBETH, participants were asked to qualitatively rate pairwise comparisons of SF-6D health states. The scoring within each dimension was conducted in parallel group sessions. Final agreement on the scores as well as weights for the SF-6D dimensions were derived in a subsequent plenary assembly. Results were analyzed using the software M-MACBETH and qualitative content analysis. Results: A total of 34 participants were recruited. While each of the 6 small groups presented a consented score, the plenary assembly reached consensus on all dimensions apart from pain. Concerning dimension weights, some participants favored prioritizing pain and mental health. Others disputed that trade-offs between dimensions and thus assigning weights were not acceptable in a context where this may involve withholding care from someone. As a consequence, no consensus on a value set was reached. Participants identified the group size of the plenary session and the applied weighting procedure as main obstacles to the process. Conclusions: This pilot study presents a consensus-based approach for valuing health-related quality of life. However, further research is needed on deliberative processes that yield quantifiable results. Future conferences should explore smaller group sizes, longer durations of the deliberative process and alternatives to the additive value function applied in MACBETH.

N2  - This paper is a case study of utilizing machine learning for developing a decision-making system for auditors before initializing the audit fieldwork of public firms. Annual data of 777 firms from 14 different sectors are collected and a MCTOPE (Multi criteria ToPsis based Ensemble) framework is implemented to build an ensemble classifier. MCTOPE framework optimizes the performance of classification during ensemble building using the TOPSIS multi-criteria decision-making algorithm. Ensemble machine learning is used for optimizing the prediction performance of suspicious firm predictor in the previous work available at https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08839514.2018.1451032. After achieving an accuracy of 94.6% and AUC (area under the curve) value of 0.98, this ensemble classifier is employed in a web application developed for auditors using Python and R script for the prediction of suspicious firm before planning an external audit. The performance of an ensemble classifier is validated using K-fold cross validation technique and is found to be better than the state-of-the-art classifiers.

N2  - Today, we are in the era of making multi-criteria decisions based on analysis of available data collected from autonomous databases that usually contain uncertain data. Skyline query technique returns a set of interesting objects (skylines) to the user by eliminating objects that are dominated by other objects within the database. Obviously, without doubt streamlining the process of processing skylines in providing answers to user-specified queries is inevitable. In this paper, we proposed SQUiD framework that combines an index-based technique with a prediction method to reduce the computational time for computing skylines over uncertain high-dimensional data. Through experimentations, results obtained clearly demonstrate the superiority of SQUiD framework over SkyQUD framework and BBIS algorithm.

N2  - In the US, the recently introduced Principles and Requirements for Federal Investment in Water Resources captures an increasing trend for using multiple objective approaches to make funding decisions for water resources and environmental problems. Moreover, advanced search tools such as multi objective evolutionary algorithms can develop solutions to such problems, even when the problems are characterized by non-linearities, uncertainty, and false optima. However, our presentation argues that multiobjective decision support requires innovative methods for visualizing complex tradeoffs between conflicting objectives, interrogating design possibilities, imposing preferences between objectives, and eventually negotiating a small set of final alternatives. Specifically we present a recently developed version of a software framework called AeroVis, which interfaces with spreadsheet software to integrate tabular visualizations of data with immersive, three dimensional glyph plots that show up to 7 objectives simultaneously. AeroVis has been used both in the design of complex engineered systems as well as water resources management decision making problems. Our results show how a large amount of information can be quickly processed by the user, integrating the emerging concept of "big data" to support environmental decision making with human pattern recognition.

N2  - High-fidelity multi-scale design optimization of many real-life applications in structural engineering still remains largely intractable due to the computationally intensive nature of numerical solvers like finite element method. Thus, in this paper, an alternate route of metamodel-based design optimization methodology is proposed in multi-scale framework based on a symbolic regression implemented using genetic programming (GP) coupled with d-optimal design. This approach drastically cuts the computational costs by replacing the finite element module with appropriately constructed robust and efficient metamodels. Resulting models are compact, have good interpretability and assume a free-form expression capable of capturing the non-linearly, complexity and vastness of the design space. Two robust nature-inspired optimization algorithms, viz. multi-objective genetic algorithm and multi-objective particle swarm optimization, are used to generate Pareto optimal solutions for several test problems with varying complexity. TOPSIS, a multi-criteria decision-making approach, is then applied to choose the best alternative among the Pareto optimal sets. Finally, the applicability of GP in efficiently tackling multi-scale optimization problems of composites is investigated, where a real-life scenario is explored by varying fractions of pertinent engineering materials to bring about property changes in the final composite structure across two different scales. The study reveals that a microscale optimization leads to better optimized solutions, demonstrating the advantage of carrying out a multi-scale optimization without any additional computational burden.

N2  - Background: There is an increased interest in the use of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to support regulatory and reimbursement decision making. The EVIDEM framework was developed to provide pragmatic multi-criteria decision support in health care, to estimate the value of healthcare interventions, and to aid in priority-setting. The objectives of this study were to test 1) the influence of different weighting techniques on the overall outcome of an MCDA exercise, 2) the discriminative power in weighting different criteria of such techniques, and 3) whether different techniques result in similar weights in weighting the criteria set proposed by the EVIDEM framework. Methods: A sample of 60 Dutch and Canadian students participated in the study. Each student used an online survey to provide weights for 14 criteria with two different techniques: a five-point rating scale and one of the following techniques selected randomly: ranking, point allocation, pairwise comparison and best worst scaling. Results: The results of this study indicate that there is no effect of differences in weights on value estimates at the group level. On an individual level, considerable differences in criteria weights and rank order occur as a result of the weight elicitation method used, and the ability of different techniques to discriminate in criteria importance. Of the five techniques tested, the pair-wise comparison of criteria has the highest ability to discriminate in weights when fourteen criteria are compared. Conclusions: When weights are intended to support group decisions, the choice of elicitation technique has negligible impact on criteria weights and the overall value of an innovation. However, when weights are used to support individual decisions, the choice of elicitation technique influences outcome and studies that use dissimilar techniques cannot be easily compared. Weight elicitation through pairwise comparison of criteria is preferred when taking into account its superior ability to discriminate between criteria and respondents' preferences.

N2  - Much of Information Systems research is of the behavioral science category that involves the analysis of quantitative data. Typically a confirmatory approach is taken where only unconditional hypotheses are specified based on existing theory and evaluated using techniques such as regression analysis. In this paper we present a knowledge discovery via data mining (KDDM) process model based multi-criteria framework for selecting the most appropriate causal explanatory model based on the researchers subjective preferences including accuracy, simplicity, the relative importance of variables in his/her tentative research model, relative preferences for inclusion of some causal relationships.

N2  - A stent is a device designed to restore flow through constricted arteries. In the design of structural sizes for coronary stent, the concept of multi-objective optimization was developed in order to simultaneously minimize the radial recoil and minimize the axial shortening. Finite element simulation and radial basis function neural network were combined together to construct a response surface or surrogate model, which gives the relationship between the objectives and design variables of stent. A fast and elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) approach was successfully used to find a set of Pareto-optimal solutions which may provide designers with more design schemes. The results show that the new computational design method is a practical tool for the optimization of stent mechanical properties. © 2011 American Scientific Publishers. All rights reserved.

N2  - An investigation utilizing Reynolds-averaged simulations (RAS) was performed in order to demonstrate the use of design and analysis of computer experiments (DACE) methods in Sandia’s DAKOTA software package for surrogate modeling and optimization. These methods were applied to a flow-path fueled with an interdigitated flushwall injector suitable for scramjet applications at hypervelocity conditions and ascending along a constant dynamic pressure flight trajectory. The flight Mach number, duct height, spanwise width, and injection angle were the design variables selected to maximize two objective functions: the thrust potential and combustion efficiency. Because the RAS of this case are computationally expensive, surrogate models are used for optimization. To build a surrogate model a RAS database is created. The sequence of the design variables comprising the database were generated using a Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method. A methodology was also developed to automatically build geometries and generate structured grids for each design point. The ensuing RAS analysis generated the simulation database from which the two objective functions were computed using a one-dimensionalization (1D) of the three-dimensional simulation data. The data were fitted using four surrogate models: an artificial neural network (ANN), a cubic polynomial, a quadratic polynomial, and a Kriging model. Variance-based decomposition showed that both objective functions were primarily driven by changes in the duct height. Multiobjective design optimization was performed for all four surrogate models via a genetic algorithm method. Optimal solutions were obtained at the upper and lower bounds of the flight Mach number range. The Kriging model predicted an optimal solution set that exhibited high values for both objective functions. Additionally, three challenge points were selected to assess the designs on the Pareto fronts. Further sampling among the designs of the Pareto fronts may be required to lower the surrogate model errors and perform more accurate surrogate-model-based optimization.

N2  - Interval number ranking and the operation reduction are studied in this paper. Firstly, the priority relation of interval numbers is redefined by introducing a new priority-degree. We proved that the new priority-degree can avoid the unreasonable phenomenon that the denominator is zero when interval numbers degrade into real numbers. Then, some important comparison related concepts of the interval numbers, such as totally greater than, greater than, exactly equal and equal to etc., are redefined based on the new priority-degree. We also prove that interval numbers are reducible for addition and subtraction according to the redefined equal to relation. Finally, priority-degree based multi-criteria decision making method for uncertain problems with interval data is given and its validation is shown by an example.

N2  - Multi Criteria decision making (MCDM) problems can be handled with the help of fuzzy set theory and moreover, this theory has been extended to a new concept called IFS named as Intuitionistic fuzzy set. There has been an increasing demand in the growing research under the fuzzy environment because of numerous applications such as artificial intelligence, medical science, logic programming, medical diagnosis, neural networks and machine learning. We have systematically conducted a review on this topic after a deep analysis of 50 research papers to provide a new framework from all the existing theoretical results, logic and applications.

N2  - New Land Combat Vehicles (LCV) are being acquired to improve the fighting capability of the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Combat vehicle design has traditionally focussed on the use of new and improved technologies to provide an appropriate level of survivability and lethality against a range of threats. However, other factors such as sensors, firepower, mobility, tactics, situational awareness and communications also play a role in increasing or decreasing the survivability and lethality of LCV. For the most part, LCV system interactions between the components are defined by logical or physical links which complicate the evaluation of its capabilities. In addition, the different types of operational scenarios and threats provide a challenge to the Decision Maker (DM) in providing a clear answer to the problem of determining the ‘best’ combination of LCV system configurations. This paper utilises two methodologies, Bayesian Network (BN) and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), and presents a hybrid decision making model for evaluating the operational impact of different LCV system specifications and configurations. BN is employed to establish a qualitative and quantitative representation of the relations between the variables of the model and calculate standard values of uncertain LCV capabilities like survivability, lethality, etc. MCDA is adopted to integrate the influence of LCV capabilities and calculate the utility value of the selected options. In order to analyse a very large number of model outputs from all possible system components, a prototype tool of the hybrid approach has been developed. This tool conveniently performs inferences over the BN, examines various proposed configurations in a more intuitive and friendly fashion using data analysis, visualisation and sensitivity analysis techniques, and also searches for the ‘best’ configuration for the LCV system. The tool utilises public-release BN software (GeNIe), statistical packages (R) and a built-in Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to allow the required calculations to be completed automatically and the results captured in both tabular and graphical form.

N2  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is performance enhancement of ferrite-assisted synchronous reluctance (FASR) motor using multi-objective differential evolution (MODE) algorithm, considering the significant geometric design parameters. Design/methodology/approach - This work illustrates the optimization of FASR motor using MODE algorithm to enhance the performance of the motor considering barrier angular positions, magnet height, magnet axial length, flux barrier angles of the rotor and air gap length. In the optimization routine to determine the performance parameters, generalized regression neural network-based interpolation is used. The results of MODE are validated with multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and multi-objective genetic algorithm. Findings - The design optimization procedure developed in this work for FASR motor aims at achieving multiple objectives, namely, average torque, torque ripple and efficiency. With multiple objectives, it is essential to give the designer the tradeoff between different objectives so as to arrive at the best design suitable for the application. The results obtained in this work justify the application of the MODE approach for FASR motor to determine the various feasible solutions within the bounds of the design. Research limitations/implications - Analysis, design and optimization of synchronous reluctance motor has been explored in detail to establish its potential for variable speed applications. In recent years, the focus is toward the electromagnetic design of hybrid configurations such as FASR motor. It is in this preview this work aims to achieve optimal design of FASR motor using multi-objective optimization approach. Practical/implications - The results of this work will supplement and encourage the application of FASR motor as a viable alternate for variable speed drive applications. In addition, the application of MODE to arrive at better design solutions is demonstrated. Originality/value - The approach presented in this work focuses on obtaining enhanced design of FASR motor considering average torque, torque ripple and efficiency as performance measures. The posteriori analysis of optimization provides an insight into the choice of parameters involved and their effects on the design of FASR motor. The efficacy of the optimization routine is justified in comparison with other multi-objective algorithms.

N2  - As different approach produces different results, it is crucial to determine the methods that are accurate in order to perform analysis towards the event. This research aim is to compare the Rank Reciprocal (MCDM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) analysis techniques in determining susceptible zones of landslide hazard. The study is based on data obtained from various sources such as local authority; Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur (DBKL), Jabatan Kerja Raya (JKR) and other agencies. The data were analysed and processed using Arc GIS. The results were compared by quantifying the risk ranking and area differential. It was also compared with the zonation map classified by DBKL. The results suggested that ANN method gives better accuracy compared to MCDM with 18.18% higher accuracy assessment of the MCDM approach. This indicated that ANN provides more reliable results and it is probably due to its ability to learn from the environment thus portraying realistic and accurate result.

N2  - Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role in connecting the physical world with the cyber world through new services and seamless interconnection between heterogeneous devices. Such heterogeneous devices tend to generate a massive volume of Big Data. However, exploiting green schemes for IoT is still a challenge since IoT attains a large scale and becomes more multifaceted, the current trends of analyzing Big Data are not directly applicable to it. Similarly, achieving green IoT through the use of 5G also poses new challenges when it comes to transferring huge volume of data in an efficient way. To address the challenges above, this paper presents a scheme for humanenabled green IoT in 5G network. Green IoT is achieved by grouping mobile nodes in a cluster. Also, a mobility management model is designed that helps in triggering efficient handover and selecting optimal networks based on multi-criteria decision modeling. Afterward, we design a network architecture that integrates green IoT with 5G network. Moreover, the 5G network architecture is supported by proposed protocol stack, which maps Internet Protocol (IP), Medium Access Protocol (MAC), and Location identifiers (LOC). The proposed scheme is also implemented using C programming language to validate mobility model in 5G, regarding cost, energy, and Quality of Service.

N2  - Air pollution is a major concern in some megacities of Iran. Specific cities in the country have reached an extremely harmful level of air pollution which poses a serious risk to the daily lives of Iranians. According to news reports, the air quality index of the city of Tehran hovers around 159, which is more than three times the World Health Organization’s advised maximum. For the purpose of air pollution abatement, it is necessary to precisely know the air pollution distribution in the area. In order to obtain this figure, it is necessary to properly locate the city’s air quality monitoring stations that measure the spatial pollutant distribution. According to various reports, the city must have at least 56 air quality monitoring stations to properly measure Tehran’s air quality. However, there are currently only 20 stations within the city. Thus, the main purpose of this study was to identify the most sufficient areas for deploying new air quality monitoring stations. This study provided an integration of hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) theories and geographical information system (GIS) processes in order to determine suitable areas to establish air quality monitoring stations. Unlike traditional models, the proposed MCDM method, ANP-OWA, is an efficient decision analysis which considers dependencies between criteria and defines different scenarios between pessimistic and optimistic conditions for decision makers. This method was applied to several parameters such as point, area, and line sources; population density; sensitive receptors; distance from current air quality stations; prediction error; and spatial distribution of CO, NO2, SO2, and PM10 pollutants. The output results specified several suitable locations to establish air pollution monitoring stations within Tehran Province. The stability and reliability of the output results were evaluated with a robust sensitivity analysis method. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the proposed method can produce stable results. Obtaining knowledge regarding population density, distance from current air quality stations, and spatial distribution of CO pollutant criteria is essential when selecting locations for air quality monitoring stations.

N2  - The Republic of Kazakhstan has significant deposits of fossil fuels and is one of the largest energy producers among the countries of Central Asia. At the same time, The Republic of Kazakhstan is one of the richest countries of theworld in terms of renewable resources, evaluated to over 1000 billion kWh/year. The application of therenewable energy sources (RES), both on a large scale and at the level of a single household, ensures the transformation of the energy system to a "green state". However, these initiatives should be substantiated by relevant supportive information to promote transformation of the country's economy to a qualitative ecological state. The paper covers developed multi-criteria decision-making system (MCDM) and software tools for processing of spatial heterogeneous data which could be applied for evaluation of the RES potential. The developed system serves to evaluate the potential of usable RES as it allows the assessment of a territory of the country in terms of installing photovoltaic and wind generators. A feature of the proposed MCDM is the use of an analytical hierarchical process (AHP) in combination with the Bayesian approach, which allows obtaining two complementary assessments of the territory areas. The method allows a rough estimate in an event of lack of data. The verification performed based on the available data on the installed solar and wind power stations shows that the system gives a relatively small root-mean-square error within 15%.

N2  - Optimizing business functions ensures corporate sustainability and competitiveness. Large multinationals execute business operations based on business processes. Large multinationals are constantly seeking best practice business process optimization measures towards enhancing and managing the execution of business activities. This research develops a business process optimization modelling framework for predicting and managing business functions. The framework is developed with considerations to specifying business operations in a quantifiable and independent manner. This is based on Industry 4.0 business protocols which align with recent technological advances and smart-industry solutions. These are inclusive of automation, simulation, integration, interconnectivity, interoperability, decentralization, virtualisation, internet of things, cloud, cybersecurity, additive manufacturing, augmented reality, big data, and analytics. The applicability of the proposed business process optimization modelling framework is explicitly defined via an application scenario based on a specified set of business objective. Developed business process optimization modelling framework is effective in scenario options decision making based on business process impact variables. Results present core design and prioritization benchmarks relative to business priorities. Adoption of industry 4.0 business protocols based on multi-criterion decision-support paradigm is justified as an enhanced business-centric approach for corporate entities relative to predicting the impact of change on the business.

N2  - Rooted deeply in medical multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM), risk assessment is very important especially when applied to the risk of being affected by deadly diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD risk assessment is a stochastic, uncertain, and highly dynamic process influenced by various known and unknown variables. In recent years, there has been a great interest in fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), a popular methodology for dealing with uncertainty in MCDM. This paper proposes a new FAHP, bimodal fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (BFAHP) that augments two aspects of knowledge, probability and validity, to fuzzy numbers to better deal with uncertainty. In BFAHP, fuzzy validity is computed by aggregating the validities of relevant risk factors based on expert knowledge and collective intelligence. By considering both soft and statistical data, we compute the fuzzy probability of risk factors using the Bayesian formulation. In BFAHP approach, these fuzzy validities and fuzzy probabilities are used to construct a reciprocal comparison matrix. We then aggregate fuzzy probabilities and fuzzy validities in a pairwise manner for each risk factor and each alternative. BFAHP decides about being affected and not being affected by ranking of high and low risks. For evaluation, the proposed approach is applied to the risk of being affected by CHD using a real dataset of 152 patients of Iranian hospitals. Simulation results confirm that adding validity in a fuzzy manner can accrue more confidence of results and clinically useful especially in the face of incomplete information when compared with actual results. Applying the proposed BFAHP on CHD risk assessment of the dataset, it yields high accuracy rate above 85% for correct prediction. In addition, this paper recognizes that the risk factors of diastolic blood pressure in men and high-density lipoprotein in women are more important in CHD than other risk factors.

N2  - As an important tool for multi-criteria decision making in database systems, the regret minimization query is shown to have the merits of top-k and skyline queries: it controls the output size while does not need users to provide any preferences. Existing researches verify that the regret ratio can be much decreased when interaction is available. In this paper, we study how to enhance current interactive regret minimization query by sorting mechanism. Instead of selecting the most favorite point from the displayed points for each interaction round, users sort the displayed data points and send the results to the system. By introducing sorting mechanism, for each round of interaction the utility space explored will be shrunk to some extent. Further the candidate points selection for following rounds of interaction will be narrowed to smaller data spaces thus the number of interaction rounds will be reduced. We propose two effective sorting-based algorithms namely Sorting-Simplex and Sorting-Random to find the maximum utility point based on Simplex method and randomly selection strategy respectively. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets verify our Sorting-Simplex and Sorting-Random algorithms outperform current state-of-art ones.

N2  - In many research and development fields, the stakeholders faced dilemma to acquire the accurate multi-criterion decision making (MCDM) outcomes. Observations showed that the inaccuracy of MCDM outcomes might be due to the missing of the right context for decision making process. This research is motivated to propose a contextualization approach for better critical issues' decision making support. The proposed triad-based contextualisation approach comprises three (3) processes namely the context characterisation, context representation, and context interpretation. At the end of a contextualisation process cycle, a set of consistent triad relationships would be derived to represent the current context of a critical issue. The context could be served as the right objective for guiding any critical issue's MCDM process. Experiment showed that the consistency of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) outcome has been improved when the stakeholder used the proposed contextualization approach to depict the the right context as the objective for decision making deliberations. It is believed that once the proposed approach is conducted in many contextualisation process cycles with the help of machine learning systems and advance analytics tools in the future, it could produce a useful set of contexts or objectives for better critical issues' decision making insights.

N2  - Group decision making is a multi-criteria decision-making method applied in many fields. However, the use of group decision-making techniques in multi-class classification problems and rule generation is not explored widely. This investigation developed a group decision classifier with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and decision tree (GDCPSODT) for analyzing students’ mathematic and scientific achievements, which is a multi-class classification problem involving rule generation. The PSO technique is employed to determine weights of condition attributes; the decision tree is used to generate rules. To demonstrate the performance of the developed GDCPSODT model, other classifiers such as the Bayesian classifier, the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, the back propagation neural networks classifier with particle swarm optimization (BPNNPSO) and the radial basis function neural networks classifier with PSO (RBFNNPSO) are used to cope with the same data. Experimental results indicated the testing accuracy of GDCPSODT is higher than the other four classifiers. Furthermore, rules and some improvement directions of academic achievements are provided by the GDCPSODT model. Therefore, the GDCPSODT model is a feasible and promising alternative for analyzing student-related mathematic and scientific achievement data.

N2  - This work is concerned with the research and development of methodology for analysis of complex mixtures such as pharmaceutical or food samples, which contain many analytes. Variously treated samples (swill washed, fried and scorched) of the Rhizoma atractylodis macrocephalae (RAM) traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) as well as the common substitute, Rhizoma atractylodis (RA) TCM were chosen as examples for analysis. A combined data matrix of chromatographic 2-D HPLC-DAD-FLD (two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography with diode array and fluorescence detectors) fingerprint profiles was constructed with the use of the HPLC-DAD and HPLC-FLD individual data matrices; the purpose was to collect maximum information and to interpret this complex data with the use of various chemometrics methods e.g. the rank-ordering multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) PROMETHEE and GAIA, K-nearest neighbours (KNN), partial least squares (PLS), back propagation-artificial neural networks (BP-ANN) methods. The chemometrics analysis demonstrated that the combined 2-D HPLC-DAD-FLD data matrix does indeed provide more information and facilitates better performing classification/prediction models for the analysis of such complex samples as the RAM and RA ones noted above. It is suggested that this fingerprint approach is suitable for analysis of other complex, multi-analyte substances. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

N2  - The design of stepped spillways is a multi-objective optimization problem in which the uncertainty of parameters plays a key role in the stepped spillways’ design. A Fuzzy Transformation Method (FTM), as a first attempt, was employed to address the uncertainty through a multi-objective optimization of the stepped spillway. The proposed methodology comprises two parts. A numerical model is developed by FLOW3D® and the Multi-Layer Perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) meta-model was trained and validated to substitute the numerical model. Then, the meta-model is coupled with a multi-objective optimization model to find the optimal design scenarios in each α-cut level. Finally, two multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models are applied to achieve the lower and upper bounds of optimum solutions. The application of proposed methodology in Jarreh dam, Iran, shows its capability in satisfying the objectives and also addressing the uncertainty in stepped spillways’ design.

N2  - Many scientific papers are devoted to solving multi-criteria problems. Researchers solve these problems, usually using methods that find discrete solutions and with the collaboration of domain experts. In both symmetrical and asymmetrical problems, the challenge is when new decision-making variants emerge. Unfortunately, discreet identification of preferences makes it impossible to determine the preferences for new alternatives. In this work, we propose a new approach to identifying a multi-criteria decision model to address this challenge. Our proposal is based on stochastic optimization techniques and the characteristic objects method (COMET). An extensive work comparing the use of hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimization algorithms are presented in this paper. The paper also contains preliminary studies on initial conditions. Finally, our approach has been demonstrated using a simple numerical example.

N2  - Is the World becoming a better or a worse place to live? In this paper, we propose a tool that can help to answer the question by combining a number of global indicators belonging to multiple categories. The proliferation of statistical data about various aspects of the World performance may suggest that it should be "easy" to evaluate the overall success of human enterprise on this planet. Moreover, it also points out the intrinsic importance in the selection of indicators. However, people have different values, biases, and preferences about the importance of various indicators, making it almost impossible to find an objective answer to this question. To address the variety and the heterogeneity of available indicators and world views, we present the analysis of globalWorld performance as a multi-criteria decision problem, making sure that the assessment method remains as transparent as possible. By dynamically selecting a set of indicators of interest, defining the weights that we attach to various indicators and specifying the desired trends associated with each indicator, we make the assessment adaptive to individual values. We also try to deal with the inherent bias that may exist in the set of indicators that are chosen. As a study case, from various data sets that are openly available online, we have selected several that are most relevant and easy to interpret in the context of the question in the title of the paper. We demonstrate how the choice of personal preferences, or weights, can strongly change the result. Our method also provides analysis of the weights space, showing how results for particular value sets compare to the average and extreme (optimistic and pessimistic) combinations of weights that may be chosen by users.

N2  - Nowadays, application of electronic commerce is increasing in commercial fields; this includes procurement process which introduced e-Tendering in construction industry. e-Tendering concept is to engage lesser paperwork and provide higher transparency in every transaction of procurement process. The aim of this paper is to study ethical issues related e-Tendering in Malaysia construction industry. This paper reviewed previous and recent literature in order to identify the ethical issues and risk of corruption encountered in electronic commerce. Questionnaire survey was used to identify the current situation of e-Tendering involving ethical issues and factors that contributed to these issues. This study proposed potential initiatives to resolve the issues of procurement transparency that improve ethical behavior of parties in managing and bidding tender. This study utilized Average Index method and ideal solution (TOPSIS) for data analysis. TOPSIS which is one of the multi-criteria decision making methods for ranking the factors contributed to ethical issue in e-tendering and the potential initiatives for improvement. Results of TOPSIS showed that the most critical factor that contributed to the ethical issue in e-Tendering was cronyism, followed by lack of meritocracy, collusion, unpublicized process, long-term relationship, human greed and transparency feature of e-Tendering. In addition, from the result, it was concluded that the initiative that was known to be most potential in enhancing e-Tendering process was the features of the e-Tendering system and the ethical awareness among tendering authorities.

N2  - Forests fires in northern Iran have always been common, but the number of forest fires has been growing over the last decade. It is believed, but not proven, that this growth can be attributed to the increasing temperatures and droughts. In general, the vulnerability to forest fire depends on infrastructural and social factors whereby the latter determine where and to what extent people and their properties are affected. In this paper, a forest fire susceptibility index and a social/infrastructural vulnerability index were developed using a machine learning (ML) method and a geographic information system multi-criteria decision making (GIS-MCDM), respectively. First, a forest fire inventory database was created from an extensive field survey and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal anomalies product for 2012 to 2017. A forest fire susceptibility map was generated using 16 environmental variables and a k-fold cross-validation (CV) approach. The infrastructural vulnerability index was derived with emphasis on different types of construction and land use, such as residential, industrial, and recreation areas. This dataset also incorporated social vulnerability indicators, e.g., population, age, gender, and family information. Then, GIS-MCDM was used to assess risk areas considering the forest fire susceptibility and the social/infrastructural vulnerability maps. As a result, most high fire susceptibility areas exhibit minor social/infrastructural vulnerability. The resulting forest fire risk map reveals that 729.61 ha, which is almost 1.14% of the study areas, is categorized in the high forest fire risk class. The methodology is transferable to other regions by localisation of the input data and the social indicators and contributes to forest fire mitigation and prevention planning.

N2  - Multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) is a family of analytic approaches to depicting the rationale of human decisions. To better interpret the contributions of individual attributes to the decision maker, the conventional MCDA approaches assume that the attributes are monotonic and preference independence. However, the capacity in describing the decision maker's preferences is sacrificed as a result of model simplification. To meet the decision maker's demand for more accurate and interpretable decision models, we propose a novel hybrid method, namely Neural Network-based Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding (NN-MCDA), which combines MCDA model and machine learning to achieve better prediction performance while capturing the relationships between individual attributes and the prediction. NN-MCDA uses a linear component (in an additive form of a set of polynomial functions) to characterize such relationships through providing explicit non-monotonic marginal value functions, and a nonlinear component (in a standard multilayer perceptron form) to capture the implicit high-order interactions among attributes and their complex nonlinear transformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NN-MCDA with extensive simulation studies and three real-world datasets. The study sheds light on how to improve the prediction performance of MCDA models using machine learning techniques, and how to enhance the interpretability of machine learning models using MCDA approaches.

N2  - Management of air pollution in Tehran, Iran, has been a significant challenge for urban authorities in recent years owing to the number and complexity of the factors affecting the formation and spread of the pollutions. The present study used an integrated modeling approach involving Spatio, Temporal, Uncertainty Decision Support Systems (STUDSS) using Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the virtual simulation and strategy assessment of air pollution. Since sources of air pollution and associated pollution control strategies are dependent on location, time and uncertain variables, Multi-Dimensional Decision Support System (MDDSS) can be efficient tool for urban air quality decision-making process. In order to model and evaluate air pollution, time-series data over a period of four years, screened and classified management strategies as well as other structural and environmental data such as land uses, terrain topography, heights of buildings, climatic conditions, population density and pollution sources were modeled using advanced software packages of MCDA and ANN. They were ultimately simulated and evaluated using the MDDSS. The results obtained from the implementation of the STUDSS showed that this tool could be used to provide sustainable solutions to air quality in metropolises and could respond to social satisfaction and economic development.

N2  - The growing needs of emerging applications has posed significant challenges for the design of optimized manycore systems. Network-on-Chip (NoC) enables the integration of a large number of processing elements (PEs) in a single die. To design optimized manycore systems, we need to establish suitable trade-offs among multiple objectives including power, performance, and thermal. Therefore, we consider multi-objective design space exploration (MO-DSE) problems arising in the design of NoC-enabled manycore systems: placement of PEs and communication links to optimize two or more objectives (e.g., latency, energy, and throughput). Existing algorithms to solve MO-DSE problems suffer from scalability and accuracy challenges as size of the design space and the number of objectives grow. In this paper, we propose a novel framework referred as Multi-Objective Optimistic Search (MOOS) that performs adaptive design space exploration using a data-driven model to improve the speed and accuracy of multi-objective design optimization process. We apply MOOS to design both 3D heterogeneous and homogeneous manycore systems using Rodinia, PARSEC, and SPLASH2 benchmark suites. We demonstrate that MOOS improves the speed of finding solutions compared to state-of-the-art methods by up to 13X while uncovering designs that are up to 20% better in terms of NoC. The optimized 3D manycore systems improve the EDP up to 38% when compared to 3D mesh-based designs optimized for the placement of PEs.

N2  - Numerous countries are trying to find the best solution for conservation, restoration or reuse of the heritage buildings, preserving their cultural, historical, ethnic and spiritual values. The scientists, researchers and government are analysing the problems concerning with heritage building’s, like seismic issues, energy saving, sustainability, structures, materials and adaptive reuse. Since, heritage buildings’ reuse and preservation are characterized by multiple criteria, a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are useful in finding rational solutions for the previously mentioned problems. The current paper aims to overview papers on the MCDM approaches application in regard to heritage build-ings’ reuse and preservation area. This study employs a bibliometric data analysis to explore state-of-the-art of the defined topic and an in-deep analysis – to synthesize the knowledge domain and critically evaluate a thorough literature in the analysed topic. As a result, scientific maps were created to reveal the knowledge domain of MCDM approaches in heritage buildings’ reuse and preservation. Finally, research gaps and future research directions are identified. Results of the analysis shows that till now MCDM approaches are not widely used in solving heritage buildings reuse and preservation issues. Moreover, there is luck of complex problem solving approach in cultural heritage buildings area.

N2  - Decision making highly influences peoples’ lives and their activities. Unfortunately, nowadays decision-making process is very often affected by feeling of uncertainty and risk, whereas decision problems have become increasingly complex. In these circumstances, the meaning of ‘intelligence’ aspect is gaining an importance as it highly enhances the possibility of making the right decision. Additionally, intelligent decision-making models are very useful in various sectors of economy, including transportation sector. The typical decision problem may be e.g. the process of evaluating and selecting transportation system, which is being defined as a set of different types of elements, relationships and processes. One of the transport’s element is transport facility point - especially car fleet (different kinds of vehicles). Selection of the most desired vehicles may determine the success of the whole transportation system for the company. Therefore, the process of evaluating and selecting the used fleet should be carefully considered and based on the intelligent approach. Also, various types of tools/techniques for intelligent decision making can be used e.g. Multiple Criteria Decision Making, Group Decision Making, Artificial Neural Networks, Metaheuristic, Fuzzy Logic, Case – Based Reasoning and Expert Systems. In the case study described, the author implements MCDM Methodology (especially Electre III/IV method) in order to make the right decision during selection of the most desired variant/type of the vehicle.

N2  - Skyline attracts more and more attention from academic circle and industrial circle because of its application in multi-criterion decision support, preference answering and data analysis. However, it seems unnecessary to recommend all services in skyline while the number of skyline points is large. The number of services in skyline is always large for the reason that comparability decreases with the increase of data dimensionality. Users always want to get only 2 or 3 recommendations instead of all services in skyline. Motivated by this, we propose to compute the representative skyline which contains some points that best describe the contour of the full skyline. In this paper, we propose a new definition which we call "similarity-based representative skyline". We provide an algorithm SBRSA, which is based on a traversal approach to compute the value of similarity. In particular, we propose an algorithm to maintain the result of SBRSA in dynamic data environment. An extensive performance study using real and synthetic service data is reported to verify its great performance in representation and computing cost. © 2010 IEEE.

N2  - Identifying the fuzzy measures of the Choquet integral model is an important component in resolving complicated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. Previous papers solved the above problem by using various mathematical programming models and regression-based methods. However, when considering complicated MCDM problems (e.g., 10 criteria), the presence of too many parameters might result in unavailable or inconsistent solutions. While k-additive or p-symmetric measures are provided to reduce the number of fuzzy measures, they cannot prevent the problem of identifying the fuzzy measures in a high-dimension situation. Therefore, Sugeno and his colleagues proposed a hierarchical Choquet integral model to overcome the problem, but it required the partition information of the criteria, which usually cannot be obtained in practice. In this paper, we proposed a GA-based heuristic least mean-squares algorithm (HLMS) to construct the hierarchical Choquet integral and overcame the above problems. The genetic algorithm (GA) was used here to determine the input variables of the sub-Choquet integrals automatically, according to the objective of the mean square error (MSE), and calculated the fuzzy measures with the HLMS. Then, we summed these sub-Choquet integrals into the final Choquet integral for the purpose of regression or classification. In addition, we tested our method with four datasets and compared these results with the conventional Choquet integral, logit model, and neural network. On the basis of the results, the proposed model was competitive with respect to other models.

N2  - Problem Statement: Improper triage and prioritization of big-data patients may result in erroneous strategic decisions. An example of such wrong decision making includes the triage of patients with chronic heart disease to low-priority groups. Incorrect decisions may jeopardize the patients' health. Objective: This study aims to evaluate and score the big data of patients with chronic heart disease and of those who require urgent attention. The assessment is based on multicriteria decision making in a telemedical environment to improve the triage and prioritization processes. Methods: A hands-on study was performed. A total of 500 patients with chronic heart disease manifested in different symptoms and under various emergency levels were evaluated on the basis of the following four main measures. An electrocardiogram sensor was used to measure the electrical signals of the contractile activity of the heart over time. A SpO2 sensor was employed to determine the blood oxygen saturation levels of the patients. A blood pressure sensor was used to obtain the physiological data of the systolic and diastolic blood pressures of the patients. Finally, a non-sensory measurement (text frame) was conducted to assess chest pain and breathing. The patients were prioritized on the basis of a set of measurements by utilizing integrated back-forward adjustment for weight computation and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution. Discussion Results: Patients with the most urgent cases were given the highest priority level, whereas those with the least urgent cases were assigned with the lowest priority level among all patients' scores. The first three patients assigned to the medical committee of doctors were proven to be the most critical emergency cases with the highest priority level on the basis of their clinical symptoms. By contrast, the last three patients were proven to be the least critical emergency cases and given the lowest priority levels relative to other patients. The throughput measurement in terms of scalability based on our proposed algorithm was more efficient than that of the benchmark algorithm. Finally, the new method for determining the "big data" patients characteristics based on "4Vs" was suggested.

N2  - Article aims to find the nature and response of a hybrid vehicle on various standard driving cycles. Road profile parameters play an important role in determining the fuel efficiency. Typical parameters of road profile can be reduced to a useful smaller set using principal component analysis and independent component analysis. Resultant data set obtained after size reduction may result in more appropriate and important parameter cluster. With reduced parameter set fuel economies over various driving cycles, are ranked using TOPSIS and VIKOR multi-criteria decision making methods. The ranking trend is then compared with the fuel economies achieved after driving the vehicle over respective roads. Control strategy responsible for power split is optimized using genetic algorithm. 1RC battery model and modified SOC estimation method are considered for the simulation and improved results compared with the default are obtained.

N2  - Estimating maximum possible rainfall is of great value for flood prediction and protection, particularly for regions, such as Canada, where urban and fluvial floods from extreme rainfalls have been known to be a major concern. In this study, a methodology is proposed to forecast real-time rainfall (with one month lead time) using different number of spatial inputs with different orders of lags. For this purpose, two types of models are used. The first one is a machine learning data driven-based model, which uses a set of hydrologic variables as inputs, and the second one is an empirical-statistical model that employs the multi-criteria decision analysis method for rainfall forecasting. The data driven model is built based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while the developed multi-criteria decision analysis model uses Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach. A comprehensive set of spatially varying climate variables, including geopotential height, sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, humidity, temperature and pressure with different orders of lags is collected to form input vectors for the forecast models. Then, a feature selection method is employed to identify the most appropriate predictors. Two sets of results from the developed models, i.e., maximum daily rainfall in each month (RMAX) and cumulative value of rainfall for each month (RCU), are considered as the target variables for forecast purpose. The results from both modeling approaches are compared using a number of evaluation criteria such as Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). The proposed models are applied for rainfall forecasting for a coastal area in Western Canada: Vancouver, British Columbia. Results indicate although data driven models such as ANNs work well for the simulation purpose, developed TOPSIS model considerably outperforms ANNs for the rainfall forecasting. ANNs show acceptable simulation performance during the calibration period (NSE up to 0.9) but they fail for the validation (NSE of 0.2) and forecasting (negative NSE). The TOPSIS method delivers better rainfall forecasting performance with the NSE of about 0.7. Moreover, the number of predictors that are used in the TOPSIS model are significantly less than those required by the ANNs to show an acceptable performance (7 against 47 for forecasting RCU and 6 against 32 for forecasting RMAX). Reliable and precise rainfall forecasting, with adequate lead time, benefits enhanced flood warning and decision making to reduce potential flood damages.

N2  - A pedicle screw fixation has been widely used to treat spinal diseases. Clinical reports have shown that the weakest part of the spinal fixator is the pedicle screw. However, previous studies have only focused on either screw breakage or screw loosening. There have been no studies that have addressed the multiobjective design optimization of the pedicle screws. The multiobjective optimization methodology was applied and it consisted of finite element method, Taguchi method, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms. Three-dimensional finite element models for both the bending strength and the pullout strength of the pedicle screw were first developed and arranged on an L25 orthogonal array. Then, artificial neural networks were used to create two objective functions. Finally, the optimum solutions of the pedicle screws were obtained by genetic algorithms. The results showed that the optimum designs had higher bending and pullout strengths compared with commercially available screws. The optimum designs of pedicle screw revealed excellent biomechanical performances. The neurogenetic approach has effectively decreased the time and effort required for searching for the optimal designs of pedicle screws and has directly provided the selection information to surgeons.

N2  - Skyline operator is significantly important for Decision oriented Data Analysis (DDA) due to its capability of finding a number of user-interested objects. However, an inherent weakness of conventional skyline queries is that the output size is hard to be controlled by users. It actually includes two aspects. On one hand, the number of returned skyline set might be too large to make the output meaningless. On the other hand, the skyline may be too concise to fulfill user's interests. Current solutions for the first aspect aim to refine the computed skyline and find a representative skyline subset with a feasible size. But for the second aspect, it still remains open. In order to tackle this problem, this paper attempts to extend conventional skyline and thus proposes a novel Tolerant Skyline Operator. We also study algorithms for computing the tolerant skyline. The final experiments use real datasets for illustration of our methods. The results indicate that the tolerant skyline is more effective and practical. © 2012 IEEE.

Existing MCDA workflows reveal a number of drawbacks, because of the reliance on human knowledge in the weighting stage. Thus, new workflow presented to form suitability maps at the regional scale for solid waste planning based on NNs. A feed-forward neural network employed in the workflow. A total of 34 criteria were pre-processed to establish the input dataset for NN modelling. The final learned network used to acquire the weights of the criteria. Accuracies of 95.2% and 93.2% achieved for the training dataset and testing dataset, respectively. The workflow was found to be capable of reducing human interference to generate highly reliable maps. The proposed workflow reveals the applicability of NN in generating landfill suitability maps and the feasibility of integrating them with existing MCDA workflows.

N2  - Well stimulation using matrix acidizing techniques involves treating the formation with fluid systems at matrix rates. Fluid systems are combinations of acids, conditioners, diverters, and several types of additives. The optimized matrix treatment is often designed using computer software, involving the use of logic based on engineering fundamentals, object data analysis of laboratory testing, experience, historical guidelines/best practices, and subjective judgment of experts. With advancements in technology, a substantial number of treatment chemicals have been developed, and their applicability usually depends on given reservoir and well characteristics, such as temperature, formation type, mineralogy, presence of asphaltene, wax, H2S, etc. The selection of additives depends on requirements of corrosion, compatibilities, emulsifications, sludging, dispersibility, etc. Mathematical models are created to capture these network systems and, in turn, recommend fluid systems. However, when fluid systems are deduced from a huge database comprising an extensive list of reservoir or well characteristics, this can often be challenging, leading to a decision paradox. Under such scenarios, the problem is reformulated as a decision problem with the purpose of selecting the best possible combination against several criteria and subcriteria. This type of decision-making is termed multicriterial. Several numerical models are available to solve such problems. Multicriteria decisionmaking (MCDM) models are suitable for addressing complex problems featuring high uncertainty, conflicting objectives, and various forms of data and information. This paper examines four MCDM methods-the weighted-sum method, the weighted-product method, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSlS) method. These methods are evaluated based on the confidence level or distinct recommendation with which the fluid system is recommended. Computational results on the test problem suggest that, while all the methods are reasonably accurate, only one method offers a recommendation based on a distinct confidence level for one of the several fluid systems available. The proposed evaluation methodology can easily be used for recommending fluid systems, not only for matrix treatments, but in any downhole treatment application with any number of criteria. The MCDM methods are evaluated thoroughly and provided with pros and cons. The suitable models are explained further with examples of fluid selection for matrix treatment and validated with case studies.

N2  - In reservoir flood control operation, selection of criteria is an important part of the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) procedure. This paper proposes a method to select criteria for MCDM of reservoir flood control operation based on the back-propagation (BP) neural network. According to the concept of ideal and anti-ideal points, we propose a method to generate training samples of the BP neural network via stochastic simulation. The topological structure of a three-layer BP neural network used for criteria selection is established. The relative importance of criteria is derived via the learned connection weights of a trained BP neural network, and its calculation method is proposed. The sensitivity curve method is employed to conduct sensitivity analysis, and the relative contribution ratio is defined to quantify the relative sensitivity strength of each criterion. We present the principle and threshold value of criteria selection based on the comprehensive discrimination index defined by the combination of the relative importance and relative contribution ratio. The Pubugou reservoir is selected as the case study. The results show that the proposed method can provide an effective tool for decision makers to select criteria before MCDM modeling of reservoir flood control operation.

N2  - Modern software engineering tools, technologies and approaches can radically speed up the development and engineering of multi-Tier cloud applications and may be applied to the cloud/edge/fog computing paradigm. The engineering of such cloud applications must take into account Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs), such as end-user, software and cloud infrastructure requirements for low-power computing, performance, availability, elasticity, operational cost and similar. Such requirements should be identified and considered early in the software engineering process and decisions must be taken on their trade-offs, e.g. greater service availability while balancing operational costs. This paper introduces a new multi-criteria decision making approach via the use of the Pareto method to aid the software engineers with NFR trade-off adjustment possibilities. Adjustment possibilities may include geographic distribution of application tiers, horizontal and vertical scaling of virtual resources (such as Virtual Machines and containers) and similar. This work builds on top of technologies and tools developed under the SWITCH and ENTICE projects. The impact of this approach is the ability to fully tailor the adjustments of non-functional properties of the multi-Tier cloud application according to the decisions of its engineer. An early warning system cloud application is used to present the approach.

N2  - Determination of available transfer capability (ATC) requires the use of experience, intuition and exact judgment in order to meet several significant aspects in the deregulated environment. Based on these points, this paper proposes two heuristic approaches to compute ATC. The first proposed heuristic algorithm integrates the five methods known as continuation repeated power flow, repeated optimal power flow, radial basis function neural network, back propagation neural network and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system to obtain ATC. The second proposed heuristic model is used to obtain multiple ATC values. Out of these, a specific ATC value will be selected based on a number of social, economic, deregulated environmental constraints and related to specific applications like optimization, on-line monitoring, and ATC forecasting known as multi-objective decision based optimal ATC. The validity of results obtained through these proposed methods are scrupulously verified on various buses of the IEEE 24-bus reliable test system. The results presented and derived conclusions in this paper are very useful for planning, operation, maintaining of reliable power in any power system and its monitoring in an on-line environment of deregulated power system. In this way, the proposed heuristic methods would contribute the best possible approach to assess multiple objective ATC using integrated methods.

N2  - This study presents an industrial application of artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) to diagnose control reflow soldering process in a closed-loop framework. Reflow soldering is the principal process for the fabrication of a variety of modern computer, communication, and consumer (3C) electronics products. It is important to achieve robust electrical connections without changing the mechanical and electronic characteristics of the components during reflow soldering process. In this study, a 38-4 experimental design was conducted to collect the structured process information. The experimental data was then used for data-training via the ANN and SVR techniques to investigate both the forward and backward relationships between the heating factors and the resultant reflow thermal profile (RTP) and so as to develop a closed-loop reflow soldering diagnosis system. The proposed system includes two modules: (1) a forward-flow module used to predict the output elements of the RTP and evaluate its performance based on ANN and a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) criterion; (2) a backward-flow module employed to ascertain the set of heating parameter combinations which best fulfill the production requirements of the expected throughput rate, product configuration, and the desired solderability. The efficiency and cost-effectiveness of this methodology were empirically evaluated and the results show the promising to improve soldering quality and productivity. Significance: The proposed closed-loop reflow soldering process diagnosis system can predict the output elements of a reflow temperature profile according to process inputs. This system is also able to ascertain the set of heating parameter combinations which best fulfill the production requirements and the desired solderability. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the efficiency and cost-effectiveness for the improvements of soldering quality and productivity.

N2  - The appeal of metric evaluation of research impact has attracted considerable interest in recent times. Although the public at large and administrative bodies are much interested in the idea, scientists and other researchers are much more cautious, insisting that metrics are but an auxiliary instrument to the qualitative peer-based judgement. The goal of this article is to propose availing of such a well positioned construct as domain taxonomy as a tool for directly assessing the scope and quality of research. We first show how taxonomies can be used to analyze the scope and perspectives of a set of research projects or papers. Then we proceed to define a research team or researcher’s rank by those nodes in the hierarchy that have been created or significantly transformed by the results of the researcher. An experimental test of the approach in the data analysis domain is described. Although the concept of taxonomy seems rather simplistic to describe all the richness of a research domain, its changes and use can be made transparent and subject to open discussions.

N2  - Detention rockfill dams are generally known as economic and efficient structural methods for flood mitigation and watershed management. Despite the existing studies in the context of rockfill dam design, designers still rely on time-consuming and costly experimental tests which can only lead into practical guidelines. Moreover, investigation of various rockfill dam design alternatives in terms of hydraulic performance needs an exhaustive framework to obtain the optimal design values. With respect to these, this research study aims to investigate the optimal dam thickness and mean diameter of coarse aggregates in detention rockfill dams in order to improve the hydraulic characteristics, e.g., reduction in flood peak discharge and increase in flood duration while the construction cost is minimized. Here, a methodology based on data-driven simulation model, multi-objective optimization model, multi-criterion decision making model, and social choice method is suggested to find the optimal design parameters of detention rockfill dam. This methodology adapts data to model and model to optimum design variables. Experimental results are converted to data-driven simulation model based on multilayer perceptron neural network, which can model the relationship between design variables of detention rockfill dam and parameters of flood hydrograph. The simulation model is used in a robust multi-objective optimization algorithm, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-ΙΙ (NSGA-ΙΙ), to establish a trade-off between the conflicting objectives. Eventually, PROMETHEE decision making model and Borda count social choice method are used to find the best agreed-upon design optimal point on the trade-off curve. Results indicate that the best non-dominated solution can be considered as 10.01 and 5 cm for the optimum thickness of detention rockfill dam and optimum mean diameter of coarse aggregates in the porous media, respectively. The similar optimum characteristics of detention rockfill dam using PROMETHEE and Borda count social choice method depict the stable performance of the proposed methodology.

N2  - Recommender system (RS) the most successful application of Web personalization helps in alleviating the information overload available on large information spaces. It attempts to identify the most relevant items for users based on their preferences. Generally, users are allowed to provide overall ratings on experienced items but many online systems allow users to provide their ratings on different criteria. Several attempts have been made in the past to design a RS focusing on the ratings of a single criterion. However, investigation of the utility of multi criterion recommender systems in online environment is still in its infancy. We propose a multi criterion RS based on leveraging information derived from multi-criterion ratings through genetic algorithm. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed recommendation strategy using a well-known Yahoo! Movies dataset.

N2  - In order to minimize the total expected cost, bridges have to be designed for safety and durability. This paper considers the cost, the safety, and the corrosion initiation time to design post-tensioned concrete box-girder road bridges. The deck is modeled by finite elements based on problem variables such as the cross-section geometry, the concrete grade, and the reinforcing and post-tensioning steel. An integrated multi-objective harmony search with artificial neural networks (ANNs) is proposed to reduce the high computing time required for the finite-element analysis and the increment in conflicting objectives. ANNs are trained through the results of previous bridge performance evaluations. Then, ANNs are used to evaluate the constraints and provide a direction towards the Pareto front. Finally, exact methods actualize and improve the Pareto set. The results show that the harmony search parameters should be progressively changed in a diversification-intensification strategy. This methodology provides trade-off solutions that are the cheapest ones for the safety and durability levels considered. Therefore, it is possible to choose an alternative that can be easily adjusted to each need.

N2  - There has been increasing adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports submitted to the Health Product Vigilance Center under the Thai Food and Drug Administration. To find some signals, the Thai Signal Detection Program was developed to identify and filter the potential signals, called signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs). A large number of SDRs cannot be in-depth assessed by the Signal Detection Advisory Working Group (SDAWG) in time. The prioritized SDRs with concentrated in-depth assessment might help in finding some true signals. This preliminary study aimed at developing a signal triage algorithm that can prioritize SDRs to assign an in-depth assessment for true signals and to test the proposed triage algorithm and compare against the traditional method by the SDAWG. Multi-criteria decision analysis was chosen for proposing a triage algorithm by generating scores for priority rankings of the clinical importance of SDRs. This study had three main steps. Key attributes for a triage decision were first identified and followed by the development of a signal triage algorithm. After that, the triage algorithm was tested by comparing the triage results of the proposed algorithm with triaging by experts in the SDAWG. Six factors were selected as key attributes, i.e., fatal outcome, serious ADRs, positive rechallenge, new drug, change in number of ADR reports, and source of reports. Four attributes used in the Thai Signal Detection Program were excluded, i.e., the drug-ADR associations, WHO-ART critical term, disproportionality, and volume of reports. Six experts gave the weight for the six key attributes using their experiences, and score criteria were set. To test the proposed triage algorithm, systemic antibiotics with 86 SDRs in total were triaged by the SDAWG, and eight SDRs were chosen for further assessment. Six of them were consistent with the result of the proposed signal triage algorithm (75% agreement) and were the top of the priority ranking. The other two SDRs were selected only by the SDAWG because they were high-concerned and serious ADRs and unfamiliar cases. These could be because of the drug or ADRs of current interest, the level of being key attributes, comorbidity and concurrent medication use, and characteristics of experts’ opinions. The signal triage algorithm can enhance the efficiency of the triage method by experts as it is systematic, transparent, timely, repeatable, and also scientifically based. More research is necessary to evaluate and/or improve this triage algorithm.

N2  - In Social Media, large amounts of User Generated Content (UGC) generally diffuse without any form of trusted external control. In this context, the risk of running into misinformation is not negligible. For this reason, assessing the credibility of both information and its sources in Social Media platforms constitutes nowadays a fundamental issue for users. In the last years, several approaches have been proposed to address this issue. Most of them employ machine learning techniques to classify information and misinformation. Other approaches exploit multiple kinds of relationships connecting entities in Social Media applications, focusing on credibility and trust propagation. Unlike previous approaches, in this paper we propose a model-driven approach based on Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and quantifier guided aggregation. An overall credibility estimate for each piece of information is obtained based on multiple criteria connected to both UGC and users generating it. The proposed model is evaluated in the context of opinion spam detection in review sites, on a real-world dataset crawled from Yelp, and it is compared with well-known supervised machine learning techniques.

N2  - Skyline queries are useful for finding only interesting tuples from multi-dimensional datasets for multi-criteria decision making. To improve the performance of skyline query processing for large-scale data, it is necessary to use parallel and distributed frameworks such as MapReduce that has been widely used recently. There are several approaches which process skyline queries on a MapReduce framework to improve the performance of query processing. Some methods process a part of the skyline computation in a serial manner, while there are other methods that process all parts of the skyline computation in parallel. However, each of them suffers from at least one of two drawbacks: (1) the serial computations may prevent them from fully utilizing the parallelism of the MapReduce framework; (2) when processing the skyline queries in a parallel and distributed manner, the additional overhead for the parallel processing may outweigh the benefit gained from parallelization. In order to efficiently process skyline queries for large data in parallel, we propose a novel two-phase approach in MapReduce framework. In the first phase, we start by dividing the input dataset into a number of subsets (called cells) and then we compute local skylines only for the qualified cells. The outer-cell filter used in this phase considerably improves the performance by eliminating a large number of tuples in unqualified cells. In the second phase, the global skyline is computed from local skylines. To separately determine global skyline tuples from each local skyline in parallel, we design the inner-cell filter and also propose efficient methods to reduce the overhead caused by computing and utilizing the inner-cell filters. The primary advantage of our approach is that it processes skyline queries fast and in a fully parallelized manner in all states of the MapReduce framework with the two filtering techniques. Throughout extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially increases the overall performance of skyline queries in comparison with the state-of-the-art skyline processing methods. Especially, the proposed method achieves remarkably good performance and scalability with regard to the dataset size and the dimensionality. Our approach has significant benefits for large-scale query processing of skylines in distributed and parallel computing environments.

N2  - With the development of cloud computing technology, all different kinds of resources and services are deployed in the cloud environment. The problem of how to find some appropriate resources or services in a resource pool, which can meet a consumer's QoS requirements, has got more and more attention. In order to solve this problem, a QoS parameters mapping model and a cloud resource capacity model are presented in this paper. Based on this, a cloud resource selection method based on multi-objective decision is integrated into a cloud workflow on Hadoop, which can simplify and accelerate the process of resource selection. In this process, a consumer's intuitive QoS requirements are mapped into a set of optimal cloud resources.

N2  - Technology innovation, dynamic market conditions, changing customer requirements are trends and influences that ship design and shipbuilding companies cannot escape from. This situation represents an increase in the complexity of the conceptualization, designing and building of ships, which often is cited as a reason for system development difficulty and or failure in the delivery of new buildings—time, price and or quality wise. To improve the effectiveness of the design and construction processes of vessel new buildings, complexity should be understood, and handled in an effective way. This paper discusses the conceptual design complexity in cruise ship design and presents a practical approach to handle such complexity in early design phases. We propose the application of multi variate data analysis and multi criteria decision making approaches as an effective way to handle the conceptual design decision making complexity of cruise ships. Several practical design cases/problems are presented and discussed in this paper to demonstrate the issue at hand.

N2  - Psychological disorders have kept away and incapacitated professionals in different sectors of activities. The most serious problems may be associated with various types of pathologies; however, it appears, more often, as psychotic disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, antisocial personality, multiple personality and addiction, causing a micro level damage to the individual and his/her family and in a macro level to the production system and the country welfare. The lack of early diagnosis has provided reactive measures, and sometimes very late, when the professional is already showing psychological signs of incapacity to work. This study aims to help the early diagnosis of psychological disorders with a hybrid proposal of an expert system that is integrated to structured methodologies in decision support (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis-MCDA) and knowledge structured representations into production rules and probabilities (Artificial Intelligence-AI). © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Supplier selection is one of the important and challenging task for manufacturing industry. Since by deciding the best supplier, companies can increase productivity and also increase competitive advantage. In addition, selecting the best supplier significantly reduces purchasing costs, increases revenue and profitability of the manufacturing industry. Since this selection process mainly involves the evaluation of different criteria such as lead time, logistics, fuel rate etc. and various supplier attributes it can be considered as a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. Also multiple criteria decision making is the method allocating with the ranking and selection of one or more vendors from a list of providers. The MCDM provides an effective framework for vendor comparison based on the evaluation of multiple conflict criteria This paper presents a case study in a manufacturing industry using Neural Networks, Analytical Hierarchy Process and Fuzzy Logic to rank and assess the vendor performance.

N2  - This paper presents a summary of the discrete mathematical part of my work, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and its generalization to dependence and feedback, the Analytic Network Process (ANP), for measuring tangible and intangible factors, particularly as applied to decision making. The factors of the decision are arranged in hierarchical or network structures and judgments are then made by the decision maker, or by an expert, about the dominant element for each pair with respect to a common property. From simple judgments on two elements at a time with respect to a common property, priority vectors are obtained that are combined throughout the structure to give the best outcome for a decision. The judgments may be inconsistent, and there is a mathematical way to measure inconsistency so that the outlying judgments may be revised by the decision maker in an acceptable way or a decision may be delayed until more consistent information is obtained. In practical applications using either hierarchical or network structures, decisions are often analyzed in separate parts for their benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks, and the results are then combined in an appropriate way into an overall synthesis of those priorities. The mathematics has been generalized in the literature to the Neural Network Process (NNP), the continuous case for modeling how the brain synthesizes signals. There has been a diversity of applications over the past 30 to 40 years, and some of these are reported here. A brief mention is made of other methods of decision making and how AHP/ANP may compare with them. © 2013 INFORMS.

N2  - Utilizing multi-criteria decision analysis as an alternative to traditional screening processes for GIS modeling for landfill site selection (LSS) has attracted significant interest in recent years because of its time and cost savings and its ability to achieve better validation and accuracy. This paper surveys the developments in the modeling of LSS using geographic information systems (GIS) on the basis of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in the past two decades from 1997 to 2014. Emphasis is placed on the third and fifth stages of the overall applied methodology (selection of weights and decision rules), as well as on the efficiency of the LSS models. From the review, the strengths and limitations of using MCDA for LSS modeling via GIS are identified. Moreover, artificial neural networks instead of MCDA can be used as a new approach in the third and fifth stages of LSS models to enhance validation and accuracy.

N2  - The accelerated discovery of materials for real world applications requires the achievement of multiple design objectives. The multidimensional nature of the search necessitates exploration of multimillion compound libraries over which even density functional theory (DFT) screening is intractable. Machine learning (e.g., artificial neural network, ANN, or Gaussian process, GP) models for this task are limited by training data availability and predictive uncertainty quantification (UQ). We overcome such limitations by using efficient global optimization (EGO) with the multidimensional expected improvement (EI) criterion. EGO balances exploitation of a trained model with acquisition of new DFT data at the Pareto front, the region of chemical space that contains the optimal trade-off between multiple design criteria. We demonstrate this approach for the simultaneous optimization of redox potential and solubility in candidate M(II)/M(III) redox couples for redox flow batteries from a space of 2.8 M transition metal complexes designed for stability in practical redox flow battery (RFB) applications. We show that a multitask ANN with latent-distance-based UQ surpasses the generalization performance of a GP in this space. With this approach, ANN prediction and EI scoring of the full space are achieved in minutes. Starting from ca. 100 representative points, EGO improves both properties by over 3 standard deviations in only five generations. Analysis of lookahead errors confirms rapid ANN model improvement during the EGO process, achieving suitable accuracy for predictive design in the space of transition metal complexes. The ANN-driven EI approach achieves at least 500-fold acceleration over random search, identifying a Pareto-optimal design in around 5 weeks instead of 50 years.

N2  - Multi-criteria decision making problem has been well studied for many years. One popular query for multi-criteria decision making is top-k queries which require each user to specify an exact utility function. In many cases, the utility function of a user is probabilistic and finding the distribution on the utility functions has been widely explored in the machine learning areas, such as user's recommender systems, Bayesian learning models and user's preference elicitation, for improving user's experience. Motivated by this, we propose a new type of queries called k-hit queries, which has not been studied before. Given a set D of tuples in the database, the distribution Θ on utility functions and a positive integer k, we would like to select a set of k tuples from D in order to maximize the probability that at least one of tuples in the selection set is the favorite of a user. All applications for top-k queries can naturally be used in k-hit queries. In this paper, we present various interesting properties of k-hit queries. Besides, based on these properties, we propose a novel algorithm called k-hit-Alg for k-hit queries. Finally, we conducted comprehensive experiments to show that the performance of our proposed method, k-hit-Alg, is superior compared with other existing algorithms which were originally used to answer other existing queries.

N2  - The multi-criteria vertical handoff algorithm plays an important role in heterogeneous wireless networks. There are two drawbacks in the available multi-criteria vertical handoff algorithms. The conventional algorithms do not give the feasible method to determine attribute weight values, and do not also consider the dependency relationship among the decision attributes, which are not mutually independent. These factors make it challenge to select the QoS-ensured network for vertical handoff in heterogeneous wireless networks. This paper proposes a method to determine weight values of each attribute according to the importance degree by using analytic hierarchy process. In order to eliminate the interaction among various criteria, we also propose a novel principal component extraction method based on principal component analysis, which can rapidly choose the QoS-ensured network with lower compute cost by only using less of the synthetic components. Extensive experiment illustrates the performance of the proposed algorithm compared with previous schemes, and the results show that the proposed vertical handoff decision algorithm can effectively eliminate the interaction among the original decision attributes, and extract the principal components (Only the first two principal components are able to seize 98% criteria information of the original decision information.). This algorithm can accurately select the QoS-ensured network with fewer principal components.

N2  - In Industry 4.0, current trends on data analysis and real-time processing are intertwined with the use of development tools while conceiving products. The quality of information plays a pivotal role in this process, as the heterogeneity of unprocessed data may result in issues that increase the product's cost and development time. In this context, the Failure Mode & Effect Analysis (FMEA) is a tool that aids decision-making by presenting pre-processed useful data that can improve product design, maintainability and manufacturing. FMEA criteria, although standardised, has ramifications that have different impacts and weight in an organisation, which might end up resulting in subjective evaluations. To cope with this issue and improve the quality of the information in product development, this research proposes a Multi-Criteria approach to define the importance of FMEA criteria and their impacts in organisations in a real industrial scenario. This research is applied using a case on a Brazilian electronics manufacturer, using AHP and TOPSIS Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods. Findings show that by traditional methods different evaluators end up generating different data and weights on FMEA, resulting in different results. In this sense, the application of the Multi- Criteria methods ends up ranking the importance of criteria and evaluating the inputs from all departments, returning more precise information. Furthermore, the weighting scale of FMEA has been shifted to a customised scale for the organisation in the study, based on AHP, more suitable to their needs and following their perception, to support the decision-makers most assertively.

N2  - The major objective of this study is to design an effective control algorithm for dealing with multiple-input–multiple-output uncertain nonlinear systems. Novelty advantages of the proposed method include: (1) The network has the maximum initial rules; it helps to increase the responsiveness of the system; (2) the network has two dynamic thresholds: One dynamic threshold is utilized to consider whether to retain or to delete the existing rules and the other is used for generating a new rule; (3) the fuzzy neural network-based system can automatically construct the network structure and adjust the parameters of the system; (4) the network uses multiple combination techniques, such as sliding mode control, adaptive control, recurrent unit, wavelet function, fuzzy logic, neural network, and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution multi-criteria decision analysis method. Based on the advantages of the above techniques, a self-organizing recurrent wavelet fuzzy neural network control system is designed comprising a main controller and a robust compensator. The gradient descent method is used to online tune the parameters for the main controller, and a Lyapunov stability theorem is applied to guarantee the system’s stability. Finally, the proposed control system is applied to a nonlinear chaotic system, an inverted double-pendulum system, and an unmanned aerial vehicle motion control to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. The simulation results show that the proposed control scheme can achieve favorable control performance.

N2  - Designing mechatronic systems is known to be a very complex and tedious process due to the high number of system components, their multi-physical aspects, the couplings between the different domains involved in the product, and the interacting design objectives. This inherent complexity calls for the crucial need of a systematic and multi-objective design thinking methodology to replace the often-used sequential design approach that tends to deal with the different domains and their corresponding design objectives separately leading to functional but not necessarily optimal designs. Thus, a new approach based on a multi-criteria profile for mechatronic systems is presented in this paper for the conceptual design stage. Additionally, to facilitate fitting the intuitive requirements for decision-making in the presence of interacting criteria, three different methods are proposed and compared using a case study of designing a vision-guided quadrotor drone system. These methods benefit from three different aggregation techniques such as Choquet integral, Sugeno integral and fuzzy-based neural network. To validate the decision yielded by the results of global concept score for each aggregation methods, a computer simulation of a visual servoing system on all design alternatives for quadrotor drone has been performed. It is shown that although the Sugeno fuzzy can be a useful aggregation function for decisions under uncertainty, but the approaches using Choquet fuzzy and fuzzy integral-based neural network seem to be more precise and reliable in a multi-criteria design problem where interaction between the objectives cannot be overlooked.

N2  - In this paper, we consider the problem of automatically assessing sofware quality. We show that we can look at this problem, called Software Quality Assessment (SQA), as a multicriteria decision-making problem. Indeed, just like software is assessed along different criteria, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is about decisions that are based on several criteria that are usually conflicting and non-homogenously satisfied. Nonadditive (fuzzy) measures along with the Choquet integral can be used to model and aggregate the levels of satisfaction of these criteria by considering their relationships. However, in practice, fuzzy measures are difficult to identify. An automated process is necessary and possible when sample data is available. Several optimization approaches have been proposed to extract fuzzy measures from sample data; e.g., genetic algorithms, gradient descent algorithms, and the Bees algorithm, all local search techniques. In this article, we propose a hybrid approach, combining the Bees algorithm and an interval constraint solver, resulting in a focused search expected to be less prone to falling into local results. Our approach, when tested on SQA decision data, shows promise and compares well to previous approaches to SQA that were using machine learning techniques. © 2012 IEEE.

N2  - Accounting choices have significant impacts on companies' accounting results which are closely monitored by managers, investors and government agencies. This paper proposes an intelligent system based approach to accounting choices evaluation and selection. The approach addresses the accounting choice decision making problem from a novel perspective. To select the most suitable accounting choice method, an artificial neural network model is developed to examine the complex interactions between operational data and accounting results. By applying intelligent and multicriteria decision making techniques, this paper takes a broader scope that is traditionally challenging in predicting and evaluating the consequence of alternative accounting methods with regard to business strategic goals. Results of a preliminary study provide new insights into accounting choice selection problems. This paper contributes to accounting choice research by proposing a new approach for filling existing gaps and providing solutions for accounting choice decision making in practical settings.

N2  - Recent researchers widely used nanoparticle additives for improving thermal and rheological properties of machine lubricant. In present study the effect of Al2O3 and CeO2 nanoparticles on transmission oil (SAE30), hydraulic oil (HYDREX100) and gear oil (EP90) of heavy earth moving machinery is investigated. Nano-lubricant samples are prepared in 0.01–4% nanoparticle volume fraction range. Four machine learning techniques namely decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), generalized linear models and neural network (NN) have been used to predict the kinematic viscosity for Al2O3 and CeO2 nanolubricants. Further, multi-criteria decision-making technique named technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution have been used to find the best predictive method in each category of the nanolubricants. DT, RF and NN methods are found to be most accurate in kinematic viscosity prediction of transmission oil (R2 = 0.861), hydraulic oil (R2 = 0.971) and gear oil (R2 = 0.973), respectively.

N2  - The selection of the reference set in the frame of Disaggregation - Aggregation (D-A) methods (UTA*, UTA II, UTADIS), constitutes one of the most important steps of the process, while it influences the accuracy and reliability of the assessed preference model. The reference set ought to satisfy two conditions: a) the alternatives of the reference set should be familiar to the Decision Maker (DM) so as to express his/her preferences from a known situation; and b) the selected alternatives have to be representative of the total set, so that all the different points of view of the decision space to be taken into consideration. This paper presents a clustering technique that is embedded in the Multicriteria Decision Aid Systems MINORA and MIIDAS, which incorporates threshold of dissimilarity in order to support DMs or Decision Analysts (DAs) to select a representative reference set. This technique is compared with the most familiar multivariate data analysis clustering methods, such as k-means and hierarchical. Also, the technique is illustrated through a real world case study. © 2010 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

N2  - Hazard identification is the key step in risk assessment and management of manufactured nanomaterials (NM). However, the rapid commercialisation of nano-enabled products continues to out-pace the development of a prudent risk management mechanism that is widely accepted by the scientific community and enforced by regulators. However, a growing body of academic literature is developing promising quantitative methods. Two approaches have gained significant currency. Bayesian networks (BN) are a probabilistic, machine learning approach while the weight of evidence (WoE) statistical framework is based on expert elicitation. This comparative study investigates the efficacy of quantitativeWoE and Bayesian methodologies in ranking the potential hazard of metal and metal-oxide NMs—TiO2, Ag, and ZnO. This research finds that hazard ranking is consistent for both risk assessment approaches. The BN andWoE models both utilize physico-chemical, toxicological, and study type data to infer the hazard potential. The BN exhibits more stability when the models are perturbed with new data. The BN has the significant advantage of self-learning with new data; however, this assumes all input data is equally valid. This research finds that a combination of WoE that would rank input data along with the BN is the optimal hazard assessment framework.

N2  - This work proposes a new approach by integrating statistical, machine learning, and multi-criteria decision analysis, including artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression (LR), frequency ratio (FR), and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Dependent (flood inventory) and independent variables (flood causative factors) were prepared using remote sensing data and the Mike-11 hydrological model and secondary data from different sources. The flood inventory map was randomly divided into training and testing datasets, where 334 flood locations (70%) were used for training and the remaining 141 locations (30%) were employed for testing. Using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), predictive power of the model was tested. The results revealed that LR model had the highest success rate (81.60%) and prediction rate (86.80%), among others. Furthermore, different combinations of the models were evaluated for flood susceptibility mapping and the best combination (11C) was used for generating a new flood hazard map for Bangladesh. The performance of the 11C integrated models was also evaluated using the AUROC and found that integrated LR-FR model had the highest predictive power with an AUROC value of 88.10%. This study offers a new opportunity to the relevant authority for planning and designing flood control measures.

N2  - Purpose: It is increasingly accepted in the food and drink manufacturing sector that there is a need to manage unavoidable food waste more sustainably. Yet to do so requires careful balancing of environmental, social and economic performance of any given treatment method alongside its technological maturity and alignment with that company’s wider business goals. The purpose of this article is to apply a novel Sustainable Waste Valorisation Identification (SWaVI) framework which considers these criteria to a case study with Molson Coors to identify whether the current strategy of using In Field Barley Straw Residue as animal feed is the most sustainable. Methods: Data was collected via a series of interviews with Molson Coors in spring 2017. Data analysis used a hybrid approach combining Cost–Benefit Analysis and Life-Cycle Assessment with a weighted summation variant of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to facilitate comparison of supercritical CO2 extraction of wax from straw, with the current strategy of selling that straw as animal feed. Results: Application of the SWaVI framework suggests that supercritical CO2 extraction of wax from straw offers a slightly worse Net Present Value compared to sale as animal feed (£89.1 million compared to £95.3 million) but superior social impacts, technological maturity and alignment with company goals making it superior overall. Conclusions: Whilst the supercritical CO2 extraction of wax offers the best sustainability and business case performance for Molson Coors, a range of other factors such as long-term market demand, alignment with relevant legislation, and displacement effects on supply chain stakeholders must be considered.

N2  - Many real-world classification systems must comply with a series of inherent restrictions to the problem at hand such as response times, power consumptions or computational costs. This poses a fundamental limitation to traditional performance-driven classifiers and learning algorithms by restraining their applicability in cost-sensitive scenarios. Because of this, fuzzy systems are leveraged to learn cost-conscious multi-stage classifiers through multiobjective optimization to find a set of optimal tradeoffs between accuracy and any related cost. This approach allows find a suitable balance between all objectives regardless of the scenario. Experimental evaluations were done for Sound Environment Classification in modern battery-powered hearing aids by jointly optimising classification accuracy and computational costs.

N2  - With the increased frequency of natural hazards and disasters and consequent losses, it is imperative to develop efficient and timely strategies for emergency response and relief operations. In this paper, we propose a cyberGIS-enabled multi-criteria spatial decision support system for supporting rapid decision making during emergency management. It combines a high-performance computing environment (cyberGIS-Jupyter) and multi-criteria decision analysis models (Weighted Sum Model (WSM) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution Model (TOPSIS)) with various types of social vulnerability indicators to solve decision problems that contain conflicting evaluation criteria in a flood emergency situation. Social media data (e.g. Twitter data) was used as an additional tool to support the decision-making process. Our case study involves two decision goals generated based on a past flood event in the city of Austin, Texas, U.S.A. As our result shows, WSM produces more diverse values and higher output category estimations than the TOPSIS model. Finally, the model was validated using an innovative questionnaire. This cyberGIS- enabled spatial decision support system allows collaborative problem solving and efficient knowledge transformation between decision makers, where different emergency responders can formulate their decision objectives, select relevant evaluation criteria, and perform interactive weighting and sensitivity analyses.

N2  - This paper addresses an important materials engineering question: How can one identify the complete space (or as much of it as possible) of microstructures that are theoretically predicted to yield the desired combination of properties demanded by a selected application? We present a problem involving design of magnetoelastic Fe-Ga alloy microstructure for enhanced elastic, plastic and magnetostrictive properties. While theoretical models for computing properties given the microstructure are known for this alloy, inversion of these relationships to obtain microstructures that lead to desired properties is challenging, primarily due to the high dimensionality of microstructure space, multi-objective design requirement and non-uniqueness of solutions. These challenges render traditional search-based optimization methods incompetent in terms of both searching efficiency and result optimality. In this paper, a route to address these challenges using a machine learning methodology is proposed. A systematic framework consisting of random data generation, feature selection and classification algorithms is developed. Experiments with five design problems that involve identification of microstructures that satisfy both linear and nonlinear property constraints show that our framework outperforms traditional optimization methods with the average running time reduced by as much as 80% and with optimality that would not be achieved otherwise.

N2  - The clustering of a product's components into modules is an effective means of creating modular architectures. This article initially links the clustering efficiency with the interactions of a product's components, and interesting observations are extracted. A novel clustering method utilising neural network algorithms and design structure matrices (DSMs) is then introduced. The method is capable of reorganising the components of a product in clusters, in order for the interactions to be maximised inside and minimised outside the clusters. In addition, a multi-criteria decision-making approach is used, in order for the efficiency of the different clustering alternatives, derived by the network, to be evaluated. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate and assess the application of the method. The derived algorithmic clustering proved to be more efficient compared with the empirical one, and thus, it can be used by design engineers as an effective tool for the derivation of product clustering alternatives. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Supply Chain Management (SCM) is becoming more complex day by day. Functional silos on demand and supply fronts of products are required to be addressed to implement the de-coupling point in preferences of consumers involved in a supply chain for optimization of operational efficiency, and nowadays, it has become a challenge. Again, ‘Amazon Effect’ has forced others to reset their strategies for optimizing their effectiveness. For the optimization of operational efficiency, three technologies have been used in the present work. TOPSIS, one of the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Techniques, has been applied to provide preferences of consumers of different criteria against different attributes (products). For tracking the products on transit, Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) method can be employed in SCM to collect and share data of event(s) or ‘Things’ for a broad range through the Internet of Things (IoT) application. Finally, Cloud Computing has been proposed to be applied for managing Big Data that will be generated during this entire process of SCM. The optimization method of a quick or agile SCM based on TOPSIS, IoT and Cloud Computing is discussed in detail in this work to benefit industries.

N2  - Aimed at the problems of low output torque of permanent magnet spherical motor (PMSM), an effective multi-objective optimization design method to Improve torque characteristics and reduce limited material volume, improve the motor load characteristics, reduce design costs is present. At first, based on finite element analysis (FEA) data, a particle swarm optimization-optimized BP neural network (PSO-BP) modelling method is proposed, which solves the modelling by drawing the nonlinear and complex relationship between structural parameters and torque problem. Then, an adaptive grid multi-objective particle swarm optimization (AGA-MOPSO) algorithm is proposed to search for the best structural parameters, and a Pareto optimization frontier map are obtained. Finally, according to the FEA simulation analysis, the best solution is selected from the Pareto optimization results. The simulation results show that compared with the original motor, the torque has increased by approximately 43.52% and the volume has decreased by approximately 7.8%, which proves the correctness and feasibility of this method.

N2  - This study aimed to develop a new methodology for evaluating and benchmarking a multi-agent learning neural network and Bayesian model for real-time skin detectors based on Internet of things (IoT) by using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). The novelty of this work is in the use of an evaluation matrix for the performance evaluation of real-time skin detectors that are based on IoT. Nevertheless, an issue with the performance evaluation of real-time skin detector approaches is the determination of sensible criteria for performance metrics and the trade-off amongst them on the basis of different colour spaces. An experiment was conducted on the basis of three phases. In the first phase, a real-time camera based on cloud IoT was used to gather different caption images. The second phase could be divided into two stages. In the first stage, a skin detection approach was developed by applying multi-agent learning based on different colour spaces. This stage aimed to create a decision matrix of various colour spaces and three groups of criteria (i.e. reliability, time complexity and error rate within a dataset) for testing and evaluating the developed skin detection approaches. In the second stage, Pearson rules were utilised to calculate the correlation between the criteria in order to make sure, either needs to use all of the criteria in decision matrix and the criteria facts that affect the behaviour of each criterion, in order to make sure that use all the criteria in evaluation as multidimensional measurements or not. In the third phase, the MCDM method was used by integrating between a technique in order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution and multi-layer analytic hierarchy process to benchmark numerous real-time IoT skin detection approaches based on the performed decision matrix from the second phase. Three groups of findings were obtained. Firstly, (1) statistically significant differences were found between the criteria that emphasise the need to use all of the criteria in evaluation. (2) The behaviour of the criteria in all scenarios was affected by the distribution of threshold values for each criterion based on the different colour spaces used. Therefore, the differences in the behaviour of criteria that highlight the use of the criteria in evaluation were included as multidimensional measurements. Secondly, an overall comparison of external and internal aggregation values in selecting the best colour space, namely the normalised RGB at the sixth threshold, was discussed. Thirdly, (1) the YIQ colour space had the lowest value and was the worst case, whereas the normalised RGB had the highest value and was the most recommended of all spaces. (2) The lowest threshold was obtained at 0.5, whereas the best value was 0.9.

N2  - In order to solve the problems of poor efficiency and low accuracy of resource allocation in current grid resource allocation management, a grid resource allocation management algorithm based on optimized multi-task target decision-making is proposed. By introducing the multi-task target feature approach decision-making algorithm, the grid resource feature parameters and ideal points of allocation path are accurately calculated so as to obtain standardized selection parameters of multi-task target allocation vectors and accurately decide any allocation path of multi-target resources according to the selection parameters. At the same time, with the help of grid hierarchical model, the optimal management mode is adopted to realize the resource allocation and management of multi-task and multi-objective decision-making grid. Experiments show that The algorithm effectively improves the efficiency of resource allocation and improves accuracy, the accuracy of grid resource allocation management algorithm based on optimized multi-task decision-making is more than 40% higher than the traditional algorithm, and the resource allocation approach is smoother, effectively improving the efficiency of resource allocation management.

N2  - Smart health is applied in many cities around the world as an approach that has a significant potential to solve the problems with smart technologies. Smart health technologies provide effective healthcare services such as personalization of treatments through big data, robotics in cure and care, artificial intelligence support to doctors, etc. The mixed structure of the evaluation of smart health technologies involves many various and contradictory criteria. However, when information is in an uncertain nature, it is difficult to decide on and evaluate. Therefore, hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) approach is applied to overcome the uncertainty of this multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This approach can be used to facilitate experts’ decision-making processes in complex and uncertain situations. In this study, integrated hesitant fuzzy linguistic (HFL) MCDM approach is proposed to evaluate smart health technologies. The criteria are weighted with HFL Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and then, smart health technologies are evaluated with the HFL Combinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS) method. Lastly, the potential of this approach is presented through a case study.

N2  - The first CFD-enabled multi-objective design optimisation methodology for continuous oscillatory baffled reactors (COBRs), used for flow chemistry-based process development, is described, where performance is quantified in terms of two metrics: a mixing efficiency index and the variance of the residence time distribution. The effect of cross-validation approaches on the surrogate modelling of these performance metrics is examined in detail and the resultant surrogate models used to demonstrate the influence of key design variables. Pareto fronts of non-dominated solutions are presented to illustrate the available design compromises for COBR performance and it is shown that these can give a narrow Residence Time Distribution and good mixing within the final design. The novel feature of offset baffles within a channel, explored here for the first time, is identified as a key parameter in improving the performance of COBRs.

N2  - Coastal areas are expected to be at a higher risk of flooding when climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) is combined with episodic rises in sea level. Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM), mostly based on statistical and machine learning methods, has been widely employed to mitigate flood risk; however, they neglect exposure and vulnerability assessment as the key components of flood risk. Flood risk assessment is often conducted by quantitative methods (e.g., probabilistic). Such assessment uses analytical and empirical techniques to construct the physical vulnerability curves of elements at risk, but the role of people's capacity, depending on social vulnerability, remains limited. To address this gap, this study developed a semiquantitative method, based on the spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (SMCDA). The model combines two representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios: RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, and factors triggering coastal flooding in Bandar Abbas, Iran. It also employs an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model to weight indicators of hazard, exposure, and social vulnerability components. Under the most extreme flooding scenario, 14.8% of flooded areas were identified as high and very high risk, mostly located in eastern, western, and partly in the middle of the City. The results of this study can be employed by decision-makers to apply appropriate risk reduction strategies in high-risk flooding zones.

N2  - Purpose: Length of stay (LOS) in hospital after surgery varies for each patient depending on surgeon’s decision that considers criticality of the surgery, patient’s conditions before and after surgery, expected time to recovery and experience of the surgeon involved. Decision on patients’ LOS at hospital post-surgery affects overall healthcare performance as it affects both cost and quality of care. The purpose of this paper is to develop a model for deriving the most appropriate LOS after surgical interventions. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts an action research involving multiple stakeholders (surgeon, patients/patients’ relatives, hospital management and other medics). First, a conceptual model is developed using literature and experts’ opinion. Second, the model is applied in three surgical interventions in a public hospital in Malta to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. Third, the policy alternatives developed are compared to a selection of current international standards for each surgical intervention. The proposed model analyses three LOS threshold policies for three procedures using efficiency and responsiveness criteria. The entire analysis is carried out using 325 randomly selected patient files along with structured interactions with more than 50 stakeholders (surgeon, patients/patients’ relatives, hospital management and other medics). A multiple criteria decision-making method is deployed for model building and data analysis. The method involves combining the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for verbal subjective judgements on prioritizing the four predictors of surgical LOS—medical, financial, social and risk, with pairwise comparisons of the sub-criteria under each criterion in line with the concerned interventions—the objective data of which are obtained from the patients’ files. Findings: The proposed model was successfully applied to decide on the best policy alternative for LOS for the three interventions. The best policy alternatives compared well to current international benchmarks. Research limitations/implications: The proposed method needs to be tested for other interventions across various healthcare settings. Practical implications: Multi-criteria decision-making tools enable resource optimization and overall improvement of patient care through the application of a scientific management technique that involves all relevant stakeholders while utilizing both subjective judgements as well as objective data. Originality/value: Traditionally, the duration of post-surgery LOS is mainly based on the surgeons’ clinical but also arbitrary decisions, with, as a result, having insufficiently explicable variations in LOS amongst peers for similar interventions. According to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt to derive post-surgery LOS using the AHP, a multiple criteria decision-making method.

N2  - Mobile phone applications have been rapidly growing and emerging with the Internet of Things (IoT) applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and ultra-clear video due to the development of mobile Internet services in the last three decades. These applications demand intensive computing to support data analysis, real-time video processing, and decision-making for optimizing the user experience. Mobile smart devices play a significant role in our daily life, and such an upward trend is continuous. Nevertheless, these devices suffer from limited resources such as CPU, memory, and energy. Computation offloading is a promising technique that can promote the lifetime and performance of smart devices by offloading local computation tasks to edge servers. In light of this situation, the strategy of computation offloading has been adopted to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a computation offloading strategy under a scenario of multi-user and multi-mobile edge servers that considers the performance of intelligent devices and server resources. The strategy contains three main stages. In the offloading decision-making stage, the basis of offloading decision-making is put forward by considering the factors of computing task size, computing requirement, computing capacity of server, and network bandwidth. In the server selection stage, the candidate servers are evaluated comprehensively by multi-objective decision-making, and the appropriate servers are selected for the computation offloading. In the task scheduling stage, a task scheduling model based on the improved auction algorithm has been proposed by considering the time requirement of the computing tasks and the computing performance of the mobile edge computing server. Extensive simulations have demonstrated that the proposed computation offloading strategy could effectively reduce service delay and the energy consumption of intelligent devices, and improve user experience.

N2  - Critical analyses of the perceptions on SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) have become a fundamental element of multi-criteria decision making for developing wicker handicraft entrepreneurship. The study examined the effectiveness and prioritization of entrepreneur's perceptions towards SWOT categories and factors and provided insights for developing wicker handicraft entrepreneurship in Pulwama district of Kashmir. Data were collected through structured interviews and focus group discussions of 100 wicker handicraft entrepreneurs of 20 villages selected by multi-stage random sampling. Simple descriptive statistics were used for the data analysis. Results showed that the factors like income generation (19.30%) and employment generation (19.00%) were viewed as most important strengths while labour intensive and less remunerative livelihood (18.80%) and seasonal subsistence (18.70%) were identified as main weaknesses. Further, poverty alleviation (20.70%), preservation of traditional art craft (19.00%) and improvement in public-private relations (17.50%) were adjudged as strong opportunities whereas limited marketing facilities (20.70%), lack of co-operative societies (18.90%) and harassment by officials in withies collection (16.50%) were seen as chief threats. The challenges (weaknesses and threats) (50.40%) for wicker handicraft entrepreneurship outweighed the prospects (strengths and opportunities) (49.60%) while the internal factors (strengths and weaknesses) (54.80%) prevailed over the external factors (opportunities and threats) (54.20%). F statistics (p<0.05) indicated significant differences between the internal factors (strengths and weaknesses) and external factors (opportunities and threats). The results projected the basis to the policymakers to prioritize and address the prominent challenges and reinforce the prospects for conceptualizing, formulating and implementing the strategies for strengthening the wicker handicraft entrepreneurship.

N2  - Recent technological and regulatory advances have coalesced to usher in an era where both automated and algorithmic trading routinely characterize a wealth maximization process managed by the continuous trading of equity securities. Under this approach to wealth maximization, automated trading focuses on the process determining directional trades for individual securities based upon the receipt and interpretation of new data. This paper presents a stochastic price formation algorithm that implements a cognitive decision making system modeled by twin radial basis function artificial neural networks to produce a high frequency automated trading system for individual equity securities listed on U.S. exchanges. The overall effectiveness and efficiency of the automated trading system is calibrated by estimating non-parametric quasi elasticity coefficients for individual firm fundamental characteristics. We find that automation driven by cognitive science can effectively auto-trade securities and produce changes to individual wealth that equals or exceeds the performance generated by a simple buy-and-hold strategy. We also identify four fundamental firm factors that explain the ability of the automated trading algorithm to produce a measured level of percent-positive trades. © Izmir University of Economics, Turkey, 2010.

N2  - Most of the real world problems are complex that is raised from uncertainity in the form of ambiguity. To overcome the ambiguity and impreciseness, Zadeh [20] introduced fuzzy set theory in the year 1965. The underlying power of fuzzy sets is that linguistic variables can be used rather than quantitative variables to represent imprecise concepts which are continuous transitions. The continuous imprecise concepts need to be modeled by continuous fuzzy numbers instead of intervals and real numbers. Many researchers applied triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers which are piecewise linear and continuous for imprecise concepts because of its convenience and ease. But imprecise variables in the fields of decision making, data analysis, fuzzy control, image processing, fuzzy clustering etc., need not be linear always. So parabolic fuzzy numbers can be used for modeling nonlinear fuzzy concepts to have a better accuracy in real life problems. Since parabolic fuzzy numbers are not completely studied till now and the triangular fuzzy numbers have been thoroughly studied, triangular approximations of parabolic fuzzy numbers may be used as supplementary tool along with parabolic fuzzy numbers. Approximation is a kind of de-fuzzification that has to change non-linear functions into linear functions which reduces the fuzziness for the undefined information and produces a better accuracy. So the study of approximation of parabolic fuzzy numbers is necessary and hence, in this paper, the problem of triangular approximations of parabolic fuzzy numbers is attempted using distance function in terms of α-cuts. Some properties of the parabolic fuzzy numbers which are useful in multi criteria decision making (MCDM) have also been discussed. Finally pertinent illustrations and applications of the approximation of parabolic fuzzy number have also been given.

N2  - In today’s dynamic environment, growing demand of highly personalised products had increased the number of companies working in project environment. Enterprises have to continuously adopt the new and innovated technologies to enhance their global competitiveness, product quality and productivity. Rapid development in information sharing and communication technologies such as internet of things, cloud computing and big data have paved the way for fourth industrial revolution known as Industry 4.0. Enterprises must shift their paradigm towards digitalization and intelligentization to meet the dynamic customer demands for highly customized quality products. It is very challenging to transform traditional project management strategies according to smart manufacturing systems as it includes digitalization of manufacturing processes by introducing the automation and data collection sensors and connecting the various departments with the decision makers through software platform. Therefore, this study investigates the current and future development towards smart manufacturing in project management. A smart manufacturing system paradigm based on digital twin along with the conceptual framework is provided for traditional project-based organizations with the objective to create a smart cyber physical system capable of collecting, storing and processing the data based on multiple criteria using artificial intelligent algorithms for decision making such as project selection, project planning and scheduling, and resource allocation. The resulting smart companies can have the benefits of increased flexibility and short lead time along with the better monitoring for maintenance, product quality, resource utilization and efficiency.

N2  - This study presents the optimum design of a ported shroud of a compressor for a hydrogen reciprocating engine of a high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle. The design aims to expand operating range and improve efficiency by replacing only the casing of the turbo-charger compressor while maintaining the current engine system. Four design variables were selected to determine the slit shape of the ported shroud. Factors, such as efficiency, pressure ratio, and stall mass flow rate at the maximum speed and cruise condition, were defined as objective functions and constraints. A neural network model was constructed, and a multi-point multi-objective optimization design was achieved using a genetic algorithm. k-means clustering was applied to the optimal solutions. Results showed design A with a 4% reduction in stall mass flow rate and design B with a 2% improvement in efficiency under the cruise condition. The performance of each design was confirmed from off-design analysis. The cause of the decrease in stall mass flow rate in design A was investigated by observing flow recirculation from the slit to compressor inlet.

N2  - Spatial data mining, space-temporal modelling and visual exploratory data analysis are tools that are useful not only for the analysis of multi characteristics spatial data, but can also be used for the development of Spatial Decision Support Systems. Such system enables the optimisation of decision making based on a thorough Spatial Multicriteria Decision Analysis. The authors of the present study have developed a set of multicriteria analyses with use of spatial data mining (SDM) techniques for the analysis of the spatial distribution of the allocation and spending of EU funds in Poland. The ten-year period of Poland's membership in the EU enables not only the analysis of spatial differentiation of EU subsidies in different regions of the country, but also the dynamics of changes in this differentiation in time. The proposed analytical system based on information technologies combines the possibilities offered by GIS packages and advanced statistical software, thus enabling to conduct highly complex analyses. One of the methods to carry out such analysis is the application of so-called data mining and data enrichment to detect patterns, rules and structures "hidden" in the database.

N2  - This paper studies the problem of scheduling a multiple-load carrier subject to last-in-first-out loading constraints in an automobile assembly line. Two scheduling criteria, the throughput of the assembly line and the material handling distance, are considered in order to maximise the profit of the assembly line. Different from other studies, the product mix and weights of the scheduling criteria are considered to be variable. A scheduling approach is proposed for the problem. At moments when the product mix or weights of the scheduling criteria change, the scheduling approach can select an appropriate rule from a set of given rules. In this study, the proposed approach is compared with other approaches by simulation in order to verify the performance of the proposed approach. The results indicate that, when the product mix and weights of the scheduling criteria are variable, the proposed scheduling approach outperforms other approaches. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Gully erosion is a problem; therefore, it must be predicted using highly accurate predictive models to avoid losses caused by gully development and to guarantee sustainable development. This research investigates the predictive performance of seven multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM), statistical, and machine learning (ML)-based models and their ensembles for gully erosion susceptibility mapping (GESM). A case study of the Dasjard River watershed, Iran uses a database of 306 gully head cuts and 15 conditioning factors. The database was divided 70:30 to train and verify the models. Their performance was assessed with the area under prediction rate curve (AUPRC), the area under success rate curve (AUSRC), accuracy, and kappa. Results show that slope is key to gully formation. The maximum entropy (ME) ML model has the best performance (AUSRC = 0.947, AUPRC = 0.948, accuracy = 0.849 and kappa = 0.699). The second best is the random forest (RF) model (AUSRC = 0.965, AUPRC = 0.932, accuracy = 0.812 and kappa = 0.624). By contrast, the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) model was the least effective (AUSRC = 0.871, AUPRC = 0.867, accuracy = 0.758 and kappa = 0.516). RF increased the performance of statistical index (SI) and frequency ratio (FR) statistical models. Furthermore, the combination of a generalized linear model (GLM), and functional data analysis (FDA) improved their performances. The results demonstrate that a combination of geographic information systems (GIS) with remote sensing (RS)-based ML models can successfully map gully erosion susceptibility, particularly in low-income and developing regions. This method can aid the analyses and decisions of natural resources managers and local planners to reduce damages by focusing attention and resources on areas prone to the worst and most damaging gully erosion.

N2  - Nowadays, the quickest developing rate among all kinds of renewable energy generation belongs to wind power industry. Hence, proposing an optimization framework to achieve the best design of wind power conversion system, especially wind electrical generator is required more than ever. Recently, flux switching permanent magnet (FSPM) generators that are well known for rigid structure, high torque density and lower weight have attracted high attention where these features bring more ability respect to permanent magnet synchronous (PMS) generator. In this paper a thorough analysis is carried out to find an optimal design of FSPM generator by interrogating the possibility to employ different structures for small scale wind conversion systems. To achieve this purpose, a precise challenge is laid down in investigation of various design characteristics. Hence, a multi-objective function depending on mass, cost, volume and electromagnetic performance of the generator is taken into account. In the sequel, considering multi attribute decision making (MADM) techniques, a framework based on an improved analytical hierarchy process (AHP) composed by a hybrid scheme formed by artificial neural network (ANN) and classical AHP is proposed to achieve trade-off design of the FSPM. A numerical study has been implemented on different test cases to assess the performance of the proposed framework. The obtained results prove the goodness of the proposed technique and suggest interesting solutions for the considered applications.

N2  - The paper describes development of a multi-criteria decision support system (MCDSS) to improve the quality of school education. It is proposed to apply interpretable machine learning models for making decisions on improving the quality of education in secondary schools. Existing DSS are based on the expert judgement, which can be subjective. In addition, the large amount of data and features makes manual analysis difficult. Our approach is referred to as MCDSS with “black boxes” explainer, it consists of three stages. First, we develop the target indicators that measure the quality of education. A set of four features of quality of education (Q-Edu) has been developed. Secondly, we build regression models that link the data of the national educational database (NEDB) with target indicators. Thirdly, we use machine learning model interpreters to develop recommendations. The disadvantage associated with the difficulties of interpreting the results of models is overcome by SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which is used as a basis for developing recommendations for what features of educational institution could be altered in order to improve quality indicators. Using the described process, we, in particular, revealed the positive impact of the location of the school, ratio of experienced teachers, sports, technical and art studios on Q-Edu indicators. The ratio of experienced teachers and, at the same time, young teachers younger than 25 year positively affects the number of significant student achievements. The proposed universal approach reduces the subjectivity and laboriousness of parameter significance determination in MCDSS.

N2  - Abstract: Selecting medical equipment is a complex multidisciplinary task requiring mathematical tools, considering associated uncertainties. This paper offers an in-depth study of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods to identify the most appropriate ones for performing management tasks in resource-limited settings. The chosen articles were divided into three topics: evaluation of projects and equipment, selection of projects and equipment, and development of medical devices. Three methods (analytic hierarchy process [AHP], multi-attribute utility theory and elimination and choice expressing reality) were selected for detailed analyses of their application for medical equipment management. Twenty-one work using MCDA, artificial neural networks, human factors engineering, and value analysis were analysed in the framework of medical equipment management. The important aspects of the procedure were described, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. It was determined that the AHP approach corresponds to all defined criteria for selecting large medical equipment. Managing large medical equipment using MCDA will reduce uncertainties, and provide a rational selection and purchase of the most efficient equipment in resource-limited settings. The direction for improving the AHP method was determined.

N2  - An innovative approach for drought identification is developed using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models from surveyed drought parameter data around the Dhalai river watershed in Tripura hinterlands, India. Total eight drought parameters, i.e., precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, vegetation canopy, cropping pattern, temperature, cultivated land, and groundwater level were obtained from expert, literature and cultivator survey. Then, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) were used for weighting of parameters and Drought Index Identification (DII). Field data of weighted parameters in the meso scale Dhalai River watershed were collected and used to train the ANN model. The developed ANN model was used in the same watershed for identification of drought. Results indicate that the Limited-Memory Quasi-Newton algorithm was better than the commonly used training method. Results obtained from the ANN model shows the drought index developed from the study area ranges from 0.32 to 0.72. Overall analysis revealed that, with appropriate training, the ANN model can be used in the areas where the model is calibrated, or other areas where the range of input parameters is similar to the calibrated region for drought identification.

N2  - The Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud (SMAC) explosion in recent times changed the way the customers look at and collaborate businesses through large world of data or information, often described as “Big Data”. With over 1590 million active users, social media such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn etc. send or receive messages or post or access new content every day. Businesses or enterprises understand and extract useful insights from social media platform and transforming it into useful information or knowledge along with their enterprise business data for strategic decision making. A framework for Social Media Analytics based on Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model is proposed for social media data and our comprehensive study on large-scale twitter dataset experiment explains how MCDM (TOPSIS) method outperforms against the standard centrality methods using predicted Spreading Size. Two well-known metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are applied to measure prediction accuracy of our MCDM based method against standard methods. TOPSIS (MCDM based) experiences least error accuracy of 9% in MAE and 16% in RMSE than the standard methods to prove that the proposed approach works better than the standard methods.

N2  - In manufacturing industry selection of right supplier(s) is one of the challenging activities. Supplier selection is the method of determining the appropriate suppliers to provide the right quality of products, at the right quantities, at the right price in the right time. During the last ten years based on the changes in the business sector, Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) has been one of the fastest growing areas. By choosing the best supplier, the companies can increase their productivity and also competitive advantage. In the earlier period, several methods have been proposed to solve the supplier selection problem, such as the linear weighting methods, the analytic network process, total cost approaches and mathematical programming techniques. Although the linear programming methods are simple, they are not accurate and more variations exist. So the latest multi-criteria decision making tools such as Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are deeply studied. While selecting the best supplier, many criteria are involved. The criteria may be different for different approach. The decision makers always express their preferences on alternatives or on the attributes of supplier which can be used to help rank the supplier and choose the enviable one. In this article, application of fuzzy logic and AHP are discussed with case-studies and also presented the discussion about implementation of ANN for supplier selection.

N2  - Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) as an advantageous tool has been applied by various researchers to improve their management ability. Management of groundwater resource, especially under data-scarce and arid areas, encountered a lot of problems and issues which drives the planers to use of MCDA. In this research, a standard methodology has been applied to delineate groundwater resource potential zonation based on integrated analytical hierarchy process (AHP), geographic information system (GIS), and remote sensing (RS) techniques in Kurdistan plain, Iran. At first, the effective thematic layers on the groundwater potential such as rainfall, lithology, drainage density, lineament density, and slope percent were derived from the spatial geodatabase. Then, the assigned weights of thematic layers based on expert knowledge were normalized by eigenvector technique of AHP. To prepare the groundwater potential index, the weighted linear combination (WLC) method was applied in GIS. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn for groundwater potential map, and the area under curve (AUC) was computed. Results indicated that the rainfall and slope percent factors have taken the highest and lowest weights, respectively. Validation of results showed that the AHP method (AUC = 73.66 %) performed fairly good predication accuracy. Such findings revealed that in the regions suffering from data scarcity through the MCDM methodology, the planners would be able to having accurate knowledge on groundwater resources based on geospatial data analysis. Therefore, the developing scenario for future planning of groundwater exploration can be achieved in an efficient manner.

N2  - Windows and blinds play a significant role in both shaping energy consumption and enhancing indoor comfort. But there are still difficulties with selecting windows and blinds due to the existence of potential conflicts between visual comfort, thermal comfort, energy consumption and life-cycle cost. A literature review was conducted with the purpose of developing a decision-making framework that resolves the conflicts, and allows selecting a window and blind design based on trade-off between visual comfort, thermal comfort, energy consumption and life-cycle cost. The decision-making framework was developed by integrating non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II as an optimization algorithm with analytical hierarchy process as a multi-criteria decision-making method. The optimization algorithm considers different window and blind design variables and analyses multiple designs, while the multi-criteria decision-making method ranks the optimization results and selects a trade-off design. An operating package enabled the decision-making framework to be automated. The operating package was obtained by coupling EnergyPlus as a simulation tool and modeFRONTIER as an integration platform. The decision-making framework was developed to select a trade-off window and blind design through intelligent use of simulation in analysing big-data in built environment, energy and cost sectors. Application of the framework ensures the minimum visual and thermal comfort thresholds with the lowest energy demand and cost. Architects and designers can use the framework during the design or renovation phase of residential and commercial buildings.

N2  - Ontology reuse is an important task in Semantic Web development today. To reuse ontologies, users must choose amongst the available ontologies those that meet their requirements. This is a decision-making problem. However, there has been a limited use of decision-making methods on ontologies to date. This study applies a popular multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method, namely, elimination and choice translating reality (ELECTRE) in ontologies ranking. The decision scheme is formulated with a set of ontologies or alternatives and a number of complexity metrics or attributes of the ontologies. Seventy ontologies of the biomedical domain are used to conduct the experiments. The results display the effectiveness of ELECTRE and provide more insights on the use of decision-making methods in ontology ranking.

N2  - Taking including the maximum wall thickness variation rate and the maximum cross-section distortion rate, the quality evaluation parameters of large diameter thin-walled tube NC bending, as random variables, and converting the two related random variables to independent random variables, the normal distribution characteristics of the independent random variables were obtained through the Bayesian analysis. Using the SNR based multi-objective decision-making theory, the best ellipsoid domain of quality evaluation parameter under the confidence level 1-α was obtained, which centers on the optimal parameter vector. The optimization range of process parameters was obtained by neural network mapping for the mapping relationship between quality evaluation parameters and process parameters. The bending of tube of Φ50 mm×1.0 mm×100 mm was made, and it is shown that this method has good practicability and validity.

N2  - Conventional drivers of liking analysis was extended with a time dimension into temporal drivers of liking (TDOL) based on functional data analysis methodology and non-additive models for multiple-attribute time-intensity (MATI) data. The non-additive models, which consider both direct effects and interaction effects of attributes to consumer overall liking, include Choquet integral and fuzzy measure in the multi-criteria decision-making, and linear regression based on variance decomposition. Dynamics of TDOL, i.e., the derivatives of the relative importance functional curves were also explored. Well-established R packages ‘fda’, ‘kappalab’ and ‘relaimpo’ were used in the paper for developing TDOL. Applied use of these methods shows that the relative importance of MATI curves offers insights for understanding the temporal aspects of consumer liking for fruit chews.

Results from a chemical transport model are used to train artificial neural networks and link emission of pollutant precursors and urban air quality. A ranking of different emission scenarios is done based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), which includes economic and social aspects. The Integrated Urban Air Pollution Assessment Model (IUAPAM) was applied to the Porto city (Portugal) and results show that it is possible to reduce the number of premature deaths per year attributable to particulate matter (PM10), from 1300 to 1240 (5%), with an investment of 0.64 M€/year, based on fireplace replacements.

N2  - Introduction: The taxi industry has boomed over the years, both in street-hail and dispatch market. However, few studies focus on comprehensive perspectives, which make decisions such as implementing regulative or incentive policies difficult. As an economic community working in the value-oriented process, the taxi industry requires a holistic performance evaluation to determine how to adapt strategies to survive and grow. Methods: This paper proposed the concept “Taxi Industry Health degree” based on the theory of Business Ecosystem and the evaluation of its health. A four-layer criteria set is developed from aspects of robustness, productivity and sustainability, and weights are determined through Analytic Hierarchy Process. Results: A synthetic evaluating model combining Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation and Artificial Neural Network is used to maintain the goal of multi-criteria decision-making. With the GPS and Taximeter dataset of taxicabs in the whole taxi industry in Wuxi, the model is applied to empirical studies. Conclusions: This paper provides sensibility analysis on not only the company’s order volatility, revenue growth and utilization of resources, but also influence on citizen’s welfare, energy consumption and environmental pollution, which enables practical regulations and policies within taxi industry.

N2  - Being able to assess software quality is essential as software is ubiquitous in every aspect of our day- to-day lives. In this paper, we build upon existing research and metrics for defining software quality and propose a way to automatically assess software quality based on these metrics. In particular, we show that the problem of assessing the quality of software can be viewed as a multi-criteria decision- making (MCDM) problem. In Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), decisions are based on several criteria that are usually conicting and non-homogenously satisfied. We use non-additive (fuzzy) measures combined with the Choquet integral to solve MCDM problems for they allow to model and aggregate the levels of satisfaction of the several criteria of the problem at hand by considering their relationships. However, in practice, it is difficult to identify such fuzzy measures. An automated process is then necessary and can be used when sample data is available. We propose to automatically assess software by modeling experts' decision process and extracting the fuzzy measure corresponding to their reasoning process: to do this, we use samples of the target experts' decision as seed data to automatically extract the fuzzy measure corresponding to the experts' decision process. In particular, we propose an algorithm to efficiently extract fuzzy measures that is a combination of the Bees algorithm and an interval constraint solver. Our experimental results show that we are able to improve some of the results obtained through previous approaches to automatic software quality assessment that used traditional machine learning techniques. © 2013 World Academic Press, UK.

N2  - An efficient supply chain is the backbone of any successful business. Such efficient supply chain relies on the performance of its suppliers and partners. Alignment of priorities is critical for strategic partnership. An enterprise can create greater value for their products and services by ensuring that their service providers and partners share common priorities and are willing to adjust their operations to meet the common goals. Careful partner evaluation based on quantifiable performance indicators is necessary. Conflicting criteria are typical in such partner evaluations. The AI-based solution explained in this paper leverages machine’s ability to perform complex multi-level, multi-criteria-based ranking decisions. It allows decision makers to configure business criteria which are important to meet their goals. Behind the scene multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) algorithms perform partner and quote ranking based on the latest uploaded request for quote (RFQ) responses and user-defined configuration setting of important business criteria, their relative importance and monotonicity. The proposed system also simulates your spend portfolio by changing the business distribution across various partners and service levels to achieve most optimal results prior to temporary or final award. The solution proposed optimizes your spend portfolio, strengthen your partner relationship and create greater value for your products and services.

N2  - The power-cycling hydrodynamic mechanical transmissions have the advantages of continuously adjustable speed ratio and high efficiency compared with the traditional automatic transmissions, so they may be a good substitute for the prior art. For off-highway vehicles which frequently work in low speed and confront great resistance, the zero-speed-ratio torque ratio (TR) of the power-cycling hydrodynamic mechanical transmissions represents the power performance of the vehicles. Furthermore, the complexity of the transmissions is an indispensable consideration for industrial designers. The radial and axial dimensions of the power-cycling hydrodynamic mechanical transmissions are determined by the effective diameter of the torque converter’s circuit and the number of transmissions gears, respectively. In order to optimize the zero-speed-ratio TR and the complexity of the power-cycling hydrodynamic mechanical transmissions, a design methodology is proposed. Considering that there is no explicit mathematical relationship between the design variables and the multi-objective functions, the parametric design and numerical simulation for the torque converter are carried out. The intrinsic mapping between the design variables and the multi-objective functions is fitted by the radial basis function neural network. On this basis, the fast and elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-ΙΙ) is used to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The numerical simulation for one group of solution selected from the Pareto optimal solutions is conducted. The simulation results indicate that the design methodology proposed in this study is effective. The optimal results show that the zero-speed-ratio TR of the power-cycling hydrodynamic mechanical transmissions is heavily influenced by the radial and axial space of such transmissions. The design optimization helps to find the optimal solutions for the power-cycling HMTs, which are superior to the traditional automatic transmissions and match well the prime mover.

N2  - Dust is a particulate matter in the atmosphere that is created by natural and human agents. Dust has negative effects on various parts of human life, including agriculture, health and economics. In recent decades, in various areas with a lack of rainfall and drought being contested, dust has happened there. One of these areas is the northern part of the Persian Gulf in Iran which has been exposed to dust in recent years. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and predict the hazardous phenomenon of dust in the western strip of Iran. Therefore, the data of dust from 14 synoptic stations of the study area (1990–2018) using panel data-hybrid neural network and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models were used. Finally, TOPSIS and simple additive weighting (SAW) multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models were used to prioritize more dust-prone areas. The results showed that the reliability of the panel data-hybrid neural network error estimation models is more than the ANFIS. Based on prediction models, the highest probability of occurrence of the maximum dust in the future was observed at Sarpol-e Zahab and Abadan stations (128.917 and 120.709%, respectively). According to the SAW model, the highest probability of occurrence of dust was at Abadan station (998%) and based on the TOPSIS model, Eslamabad-e Gharb, with 997%. It is necessary the inter-organizational cooperation by contracting an international memorandum with neighbouring countries in addition to domestic actions to reduce the damage caused by the dust phenomenon in the study area.

N2  - This paper utilises Bayesian network (BN), multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) to present a hybrid decision making model for evaluating and optimising the operational impact of different land combat vehicle (LCV) system specifications and configurations. BN is employed to establish a qualitative and quantitative representation of the relations between the variables of the model and calculate standard values of uncertain LCV capabilities like survivability, lethality, etc. MCDM is adopted to integrate the influence of LCV capabilities and calculate the utility value of the selected options. An interactive analysis tool using MOEA is developed to manage the combinatorial nature of the number of LCV system options available and to help the decision maker to avoid any arbitrary selection of sub-optimum baseline vehicles.

N2  - The importance of the aerodynamic performance, specifically meaning reducing both drag coefficient (CD) and lift coefficient (CL), is a growing issue in the modern automotive industry. The former is to improve fuel efficiency whereas the latter is to improve driving stability. These characteristics are quite associated with the geometric details of the external car body such that many studies are putting a lot of efforts to understand the contribution of geometrical details to the aerodynamic performance. For the design point of view, the comparison among local shape factors and the following tradeoff study are essential during the early stage of the exterior design. In this paper, the qualitative and quantitative contribution of local shapes to overall aerodynamic performance is explored with a simplified vehicle model, especially the Ahmed body, by performing a multi-objective design optimization in a high-speed cruising condition. To achieve the goal of this research, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis is incorporated with various state-of-the-art design methodologies such as Design of Experiments (DOE), surrogate modeling, sensitivity analysis, Pareto-Optimum decision making, etc. Six design variables around the rear shapes of the Ahmed body are parameterized and populated into design space via a hybrid DOE method combining Central Composite Design (CCD) and Latin Hypercube. For CD and CL, corresponding Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are created for the surrogate model. Then, the individual and collaborative contributions of design variables are scrutinized. For further detailed analysis, a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is performed so that the empirical joint probability distribution is calculated to explore the feasible and optimum design space. Based on the simulation and analysis results, Pareto frontier is identified and multi-objective optimization is conducted to seek the best appropriate vehicle shapes for different design goals between CD and CL, which weigh on fuel efficiency and driving stability, respectively.

N2  - Power plants are the large-scale production facilities with the main purpose of realizing uninterrupted, reliable, efficient, economic and environmentally friendly energy generation. Maintenance is one of the critical factors in achieving these comprehensive goals, which are called as sustainable energy supply. The maintenance processes carried out in order to ensure sustainable energy supply in the power plants should be managed due to the costs arising from time requirement, the use of material and labor, and the loss of generation. In this respect, it is critical that the fault dates are forecasted, and maintenance is performed without failure in power plants consisting of thousands of equipment. In this context in this study, the maintenance planning problem for equipment with high criticality level is handled in one of the large-scale hydroelectric power plants that meet the quintile of Turkey’s energy demand as of the end of 2018. In the first stage, the evaluation criteria determined by the power plant experts are weighted by the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is an accepted method in the literature, in order to determine the criticality levels of the equipment in terms of power plant at the next stage. In order to obtain the final priority ranking of the equipment in terms of power plant within the scope of these weights, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used because of its advantages compared to other outranking algorithms. As a result of this solution, for the 14 main equipment groups with the highest criticality level determined on the basis of the power plant, periods between two breakdowns are estimated, and maintenance planning is performed based on these periods. In the estimation phase, an artificial neural network (ANN) model has been established by using 11-years fault data for selected equipment groups and the probable fault dates are estimated by considering a production facility as a system without considering the sector for the first time in the literature. With the plan including the maintenance activities that will be carried out before the determined breakdown dates, increasing the generation efficiency, extending the economic life of the power plant, minimizing the generation costs, maximizing the plant availability rate and maximizing profit are aimed. The maintenance plan is implemented for 2 years in the power plant and the unit shutdowns resulting from the selected equipment groups are not met and the mentioned goals are reached.

N2  - Many real-world applications require the simultaneous prediction of multiple target attributes. The techniques currently available for these problems either employ a global model that simultaneously predicts all target attributes or rely on the aggregation of individual models, each predicting one target. This paper introduces a novel solution. Our approach employs an iterative classification strategy to exploit the relationships among multiple target attributes to achieve higher accuracy. The computation scheme is developed as a wrapper in which many standard single-target classification algorithms can be simply "plugged-in" to simultaneously predict multiple targets. An empirical evaluation using eight data sets shows that the proposed method outperforms (1) an approach that constructs independent classifiers for each target, (2) a multitask neural network method, and (3) ensembles of multi-objective decision trees in terms of simultaneously predicting all target attributes correctly. © 2012 © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

N2  - Like many other African countries, incidence of drought is increasing in Nigeria. In this work, spatiotemporal changes in droughts under different representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios were assessed; considering their greatest impacts on life and livelihoods in Nigeria, especially when droughts coincide with the growing seasons. Three entropy-based methods, namely symmetrical uncertainty, gain ratio, and entropy gain were used in a multi-criteria decision-making framework to select the best performing General Circulation Models (GCMs) for the projection of rainfall and temperature. Performance of four widely used bias correction methods was compared to identify a suitable method for correcting bias in GCM projections for the period 2010–2099. A machine learning technique was then used to generate a multi-model ensemble (MME) of the bias-corrected GCM projection for different RCP scenarios. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was subsequently computed to estimate droughts from the MME mean of GCM projected rainfall and temperature to predict possible spatiotemporal changes in meteorological droughts. Finally, trends in the SPEI, temperature and rainfall, and return period of droughts for different growing seasons were estimated using a 50-year moving window, with a 10-year interval, to understand driving factors accountable for future changes in droughts. The analysis revealed that MRI-CGCM3, HadGEM2-ES, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, and CESM1-CAM5 are the most appropriate GCMs for projecting rainfall and temperature, and the linear scaling (SCL) is the best method for correcting bias. The MME mean of bias-corrected GCM projections revealed an increase in rainfall in the south-south, southwest, and parts of the northwest whilst a decrease in the southeast, northeast, and parts of central Nigeria. In contrast, rise in temperature for entire country during most of the cropping seasons was projected. The results further indicated that increase in temperature would decrease the SPEI across Nigeria, which will make droughts more frequent in most of the country under all the RCPs. However, increase in drought frequency would be less for higher RCPs due to increase in rainfall.

N2  - Major research efforts in decision support systems for medical diagnosis have focused on the hypothesis testing and management of uncertain and imprecise decision variables aimed at obtaining optimal inferences. In this study, a survey of such systems and methods is carried out. The study identifies medical diagnosis as involving imprecise information in a multi-criteria decision situation. We propose a hybrid fuzzy based analytic network process (ANP) system for managing the hierarchical structuring and imprecision associated with medical diagnosis. The justification being that fuzzy-ANP system is capable of accommodating inherent uncertainty and vagueness in multi-attribute/multi- criteria decision-making with hierarchical structuring and feedback dependence. © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyse the interactions among various enablers which are critical to the success of big data initiatives in operations and supply chain management (OSCM). Design/methodology/approach: Fourteen enablers of big data in OSCM have been selected from literature and consequent deliberations with experts from industry. Three different multi criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, namely, interpretive structural modeling (ISM), fuzzy total interpretive structural modeling (fuzzy-TISM) and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) have been used to identify driving enablers. Further, common enablers from each technique, their hierarchies and inter-relationships have been established. Findings: The enabler modelings using ISM, Fuzzy-TISM and DEMATEL shows that the top management commitment, financial support for big data initiatives, big data/data science skills, organizational structure and change management program are the most influential/driving enablers. Across all three different techniques, these five different enablers has been identified as the most promising ones to implement big data in OSCM. On the other hand, interpretability of analysis, big data quality management, data capture and storage and data security and privacy have been commonly identified across all three different modeling techniques as the most dependent big data enablers for OSCM. Research limitations/implications: The MCDM models of big data enablers have been formulated based on the inputs from few domain experts and may not reflect the opinion of whole practitioners community. Practical implications: The findings enable the decision makers to appropriately choose the desired and drop undesired enablers in implementing the big data initiatives to improve the performance of OSCM. The most common driving big data enablers can be given high priority over others and can significantly enhance the performance of OSCM. Originality/value: MCDM-based hierarchical models and causal diagram for big data enablers depicting contextual inter-relationships has been proposed which is a new effort for implementation of big data in OSCM.

N2  - The appropriate selection of cloud services is a new need that resulted from the increased use of Cloud Computing. Users want to find the cloud services that best meet their requirements from a large number of available cloud services. This requires a special treatment. Generally, it is done by using various techniques, such as Similarity, Data Mining, Recommender Systems, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods, etc. The main problem of these cited methods, is firstly the large number of returned services and secondly the absence of direct communication between the user and the system. Most of methods are based on previous system knowledge, or they rely on other users feedback. In order to avoid these weaknesses we thought to add a form of communication between the user and the system. For this end, in our contribution, the user is requested to enter the values of his ideal service and then based on the techniques of clustering, the services which are the most closest to the ideal service are selected and returned to the final user.

N2  - During recent years, the importance of preparedness has increased with increasing frequency of disasters and the cost associated with relief and response activities. Therefore, this study is designed to present the identification and evaluation process of cyclone disaster’s preparedness activities also termed as measures. In this study, 27 cyclone preparedness activities have been prioritized considering six criteria—effective and immediate response, last mile connectivity, disaster resilient community, risk and vulnerability reduction, life safety and property protection, and sustainable recovery and rehabilitation. Moreover, the evaluation process for prioritization of preparedness activities involves significant uncertainty and subjectivity. Therefore, this study integrates the fuzzy logic with analytical network process, a multi-criteria decision-making tool to analyze and present the ranking of selected preparedness activities. Results of this research indicate that human resource management activities are the most needed preparedness activities to mitigate the risk of cyclone disasters in the Indian context. Lastly, sensitivity analysis has also accompanied to reveal the importance of weighing on the ranking of preparedness activities.

N2  - Ranking and multi-criteria decision-making approaches are useful tools to analyse multivariate data and obtain useful insights into data structure and the relationships between samples and variables. In this study, we present a new ranking approach, named Deep Ranking Analysis by Power Eigenvectors (DRAPE), which is based on the Power-Weakness Ratio analysis and provides a set of sequential rankings. Such a sequential ranking procedure allows to gather deeper insights into the analysed dataset. Moreover, by a “retro”-regression procedure, the relevance of each variable in determining the final rankings can be assessed, while a consensus ranking can be obtained by a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In this study, we present the theory of the novel method, and show three applications to real datasets.

N2  - Evaluation and selection of distributors are important issues in supply chain management (SCM) and play an important role in making new market development. This paper provides a new method to categorise and select distributors. After determining criteria according to the service quality dimensions as a novel innovation, the fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (ART) algorithm is utilised to categorise distributors according to their similarity. Then, two multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques (i.e., AHP and FTOPSIS) are utilised to arrange distributors in their relative category. Finally, a numerical example is illustrated to examine the validity of the proposed algorithm. Results show that integrating MCDM techniques and neural networks can remove their deficiencies and provide comprehensive approach for partner selection in supply chain.

N2  - Nominal classification (NC) is a subfield of multi-criteria decision making where an object (in a broad sense) characterized by some attributes (with their valuation belonging to an ordered set, numeric in general) must be assigned to one of pre-defined classes or categories; these classes are characterized by some numerical valued features. This is also known as supervised classification as opposed to unsupervised classification in machine learning literature. In many applications such as that of risk analysis, characterization of classes by features may not be precisely defined; they will be rather fuzzily expressed using linguistic appreciation such as high is better, low is more appreciated, medium range is better, etc. leading to what is referred to as fuzzy nominal classification (FNC). On other hand bipolar reasoning is pervasive in classification in the sense that given a couple (feature, class), there will be some values of the feature that lead to automatically assigning (respect. automatically excluding to assign) the considered object into that class leading to what we name bipolar fuzzy nominal classification or BFNC for short; the main purpose of this paper is to develop this BFNC framework with risk analysis as an illustrative application domain. The stepping stones of this framework are two indexes for each couple (class, object) known as classifiability index (that measures the extent to which the considered object can be included into that class) and the rejectability index measuring the extent to which one should avoid including this object into that class. By using two indexes for classification, many classes can be qualified for inclusion of a given object rendering this framework flexible. Analyzing risks for large-scale complex systems requires identifying, assessing, and prioritizing different risk scenarios for their appropriate treatment such as resources allocation for risk mitigation, risk prevention, risk sharing, etc. To this end and given scarcity of resources in general, one must consider first prioritizing, filtering, or scoring risks that return to assigning them to pre-defined classes or categories; that is nominally classifying them. The developed BFNC framework applied to a real world application in the domain of countries' risk classification shows its practical potentialities.

N2  - Agent-based approaches have gained popularity in engineering applications, but its potential for advanced traffic controls has not been sufficiently explored. This paper presents a multi-agent framework that models traffic control instruments and their interactions with road traffic. A constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) model is used to represent agent decision making in the context of multi-objective policy goals, where the policy goal with the highest priority becomes the single optimization objective and the other goals are transformed as constraints. A reinforcement learning-based computational framework is developed for control applications. To implement the multi-objective decision model, a threshold lexicographic ordering method is introduced and integrated with the learning-based algorithm. Moreover, a two-stage hybrid framework is established to improve the learning efficiency of the model. While the proposed approach is potentially applicable for different road traffic operations, this paper applies the framework for traffic signal control in a network of Stockholm based on traffic simulation. The computational results show that the proposed control approach can handle a complex case of multiple policy requirements. Meanwhile, the agent-based intelligent control has shown superior performance when compared to other optimized signal control methods.

N2  - The growth of computer networks from LAN to cloud, virtualisation and mobility always keeps intrusion detection system (IDS) as a critical component in the field of network security infrastructure. Tremendous growth and usage of internet raises concerns about how to protect and communicate the digital information in a safe manner. The market for security solutions for next-generation is rapidly evolving and constantly changing to accommodate today’s threat. Many intrusion detection techniques, methods and algorithms are implemented to detect these novel attacks. But there’s no clear feature set, uncertainty bounds established as a baseline for dynamic environments. The main objective of this paper is to determine and provide the best feature selection for next generation dynamic environments using multi-criteria decision making, decision tree learning with emphasis on optimisation (contingency of weight allocation) and handling large datasets.

N2  - Hybrid flowshops consist of multiple production stages each of which has multiple parallel machines. Scheduling of hybrid flowshops is a NP-hard even in its simplest form. The presence of uncertainty in real-world problems forces the decision makers to reconsider their scheduling decisions in reactive manner. In this study, we proposed a proactive-reactive scheduling approach which allows to be changed dispatching rule set applied in time. The methodology consists of three parts: Shop Floor Management system with a triggering mechanism based on fuzzy inference system, performance prediction of the alternative dispatching rule sets based on Taguchi design, simulation, artificial neural networks, and a multi-criteria decision making methodology for determining new scheduling dispatching rule set. The proposed approach is applied on a real world problem from literature and the results are compared with static approach.

N2  - This paper describes an approach that can compose predictive models from disparate knowledge sources in smart manufacturing environments. The capability to compose disparate models of individual manufacturing components with disparate knowledge sources is necessary in manufacturing industry, because this capability enables us to understand, monitor, analyze, optimize, and control the performance of the system made up of those components. It is based on the assumption that the component models and component sources used in any particular composition can be represented using the same collection of system ‘viewpoints’. With this assumption, creating this integrated collection is much easier than it would be. This composition capability provides the foundation for the ability to predict the performance of the system from the performances of its components—called compositionality. Compositionality is the key to solve decision-making/optimization problems related to that system-level prediction. For those problems, compositionality can be achieved using a three-tiered, abstraction architecture. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated in an example in which a multi-criteria decision making method is used to determine the optimal process parameters in an additive manufacturing process.

N2  - Over the past few years, multi-label classification has been widely explored in the machine learning community. This resulted in a number of multi-label classification methods requiring benchmarking to determine their strengths and weakness. For these reasons, typically, the authors compare the methods using a set of benchmark problems (datasets) with regard to different performance measures. At the end, the results are discussed for each performance measure separately. In order to give a general conclusion in which the contribution of each performance measure will be included, we propose a performance measures fusion approach based on multi criteria decision analysis. The approach provides rankings of the compared methods for each benchmark problem separately. These rankings can then be aggregated to discover sets of correlated measures as well as sets of evaluation measures that are least correlated. The performance and the robustness of the proposed methodology is investigated and illustrated on the results from a comprehensive experimental study including 12 multi-label classification according to 16 performance measures on a set of 11 benchmark problems.

N2  - Skyline query can compute the optimal solution which meets the multiple standards in large-scale dataset. It has been widely applied for multi-objective decisions. Dynamic skyline query, as an important variant of skyline, its result can be dynamically changed with choosing different query points, providing more flexibility when the users make some specified needs. However, dynamic skyline query can return a large number of query results and ignore the directionality of query point and data integrality, making difficult for users to choose. It is necessary to optimize the result set of dynamic skyline, improving the whole data integrality and filtering a large number of redundant data. Focusing on these problems, we propose the augmented dynamic skyline query method based on MapReduce. The algorithm partitions the original data according to dimensional information, parallel computes dynamic skyline points in multiple nodes, optimizes the result set of the traditional dynamic skyline and at the same time provides the more global optimal results for the user to choose. In addition, when the users provide the tolerance of some dimensions, we propose the augmented dynamic skyline query with user tolerance. The algorithm reduces the original dataset according to the user tolerance and reduces the comparison times of intermediate results with improving the accuracy of the result set. The experiment results show that the augmented dynamic skyline query method based on MapReduce is efficient, accurate and scalable.

N2  - The proposal deals with designing of a novel framework for group decision support system (GDSS). The purpose of applying such a system is to broadcast the events of an earthquake occurrence based on group decisions by analyzing the reports from the sensor networks which are set in the deep sea. Recent advancements in the field of data analytics show that automatic decision making system is indispensable, exclusively in case of an emergency circumstance. Current frameworks are mostly based on single-user decision support systems. Well-established operational research techniques such as multi-criteria decision making techniques need to be integrated in order to bring out a successful decision support system. A comprehensive analysis of the challenges in the fields of information systems and machine learning frameworks is to be scrutinized. Such a study is critical for designing a framework based on platform independent automated multi-decision-based GDSS. This can efficiently support alternative types of goals and control protocols between its users.

N2  - To effectively fight snow storms in the challenging funding environment, many maintenance agencies in North America have started to produce their own anti-icing liquids, instead of procuring commercial anti-icers. This work demonstrates a systematic approach to collaborative, data-driven, and multicriteria decision making by conducting a set of laboratory tests to assess twenty blended chloride-based anti-icing formulations. The laboratory data were then used to establish predictive models correlating the multiple design parameters with the anti-icer performance and effects or with an anti-icer composite index. The authors used artificial neural networks for modeling and examined anti-icer performance (characteristic temperature and ice-melting capacity at 30 and 15 degrees F (-1.1 and -9.4 degrees C), respectively) and effects (splitting tensile strength of concrete after ten freeze-thaw cycles and corrosivity to mild steel) as a function of the formulation design. The anti-icer composite index was calculated for four different user priority scenarios (cost-first, performance-first, impacts-first, or a balanced approach), each of which placed a different set of decision weights on various target attributes. Three-dimensional response surfaces were then constructed to illustrate such predicted correlations and to guide the direction for formulation improvements. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CR.1943-5495.0000039.

N2  - Sediment is an important part of an aquatic ecosystem, so it is essential to develop an effective sediment quality assessment tool. This study aims to develop a new sediment quality assessment tool using a Weight of Evidence approach in combination with the grey TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity, a mathematical calculation of multi-criteria decision analysis). This tool can analyze data from chemical analyses, laboratory toxicity tests and benthic community structure analyses to generate individual results from each line of evidence, and integrate data from these three lines of evidence to obtain an overall assessment through an Excel Visual Basic for Application program. The tool can compare the relative magnitude of risks among sites and rate each site with high, moderate, or low ecological risk, thus guiding us to take pertinent measures toward polluted sediment. A case study of the sediment of Dongjiang River basin, south China, demonstrated the successful application of this tool. It proved that this assessment tool can provide a comprehensive and accurate assessment of sediment quality and efficiently discriminate risks among different sites, suggesting it is a powerful tool for environment risk assessment.

N2  - Soil erosion by water and other anthropogenic activities in the semi-arid and humid region is noticed as a major issue in the reduction in natural land by the loss of soil nutrients. The seven standard parameters were suggested in the literature for the assessment of soil erosion hazard, viz. soil loss, sediment yield, run-off potential, land capability class, drainage density, sediment transport index, and slope. In the present study, the combination of intelligent vulnerability prediction, multi-criteria decision-making, and geographic information system techniques provides an effective approach to identify the soil erosion hazard in the semi-arid and humid region. It makes this process more effective and efficient as the vulnerability of soil erosion hazard can be predicted by the proposed trained models for any locations that have the streamlined values of above seven parameters as suggested in this paper. The standard machine learning classifiers such as k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, random forest (RF), multinomial naive bays, adaptive boosting, and gradient adaptive boosting (GAB) have been applied on the spatial data set of “Pairi” river watershed found in “Chhattisgarh”, India. There are five categories of soil abrasion, viz. “very low”, “low”, “medium”, “high”, and “very high”, in this data set that represents an index of soil erosion hazard. The experimental results have given 91.5140% and 90.5525% accuracy using RF and GAB, respectively, whereas a much better log-loss measure, i.e. 0.27, is obtained by the GAB in comparison of 0.93 with RF. The results have been verified by visiting the ground truth locations.

N2  - The selection of variables to collect in empirical pilot studies is critical due to time, financial and sample size limitations. The collection of patient data in the healthcare system poses additional concerns due to patient privacy, incomplete data and clinical feasibility. The existence of these intrinsic pilot study and healthcare constraints requires a strategic selection of study variables to maximize the variability explained in the patient population and knowledge gained from data analysis. We propose a value tree analysis to select data collection strategies (combination of study variables) that produce the highest preference value for the researcher while also taking into account the interests of other study stakeholders (patient, provider, clinical staff, Institutional Review Board, etc.). In the first stage (problem structuring), the decision context is framed to define the pilot study environment and stakeholder values that may impact the study design. The study objectives, decision alternatives and attributes are then generated to consider tradeoffs among conflicting criteria and stakeholder interests. In the second stage (preference elicitation), decision attributes are weighted using Analytical Hierarchy Processing and a value function is used to elicit the decision maker's preference for each variable combination. Value tree analysis is a low cost and low computation approach for time-sensitive variable selection in empirical pilot healthcare studies. The proposed approach provides a structured and strategic decision-making process that accounts for pilot study and patient data constraints and maximizes value for study stakeholders.

N2  - A post-hoc individual patient matching procedure was recently proposed within the context of parallel group randomized clinical trials (RCTs) as a method for estimating treatment effect. In this paper, we consider a post-hoc individual patient matching problem within a parallel group RCT as a multi-objective decision-making problem focussing on the trade-off between the quality of individual matches and the overall percentage of matching. Using acute stroke trials as a context, we utilize exact optimization and simulation techniques to investigate a complex relationship between the overall percentage of individual post-hoc matching, the size of the respective RCT, and the quality of matching on variables highly prognostic for a good functional outcome after stroke, as well as the dispersion in these variables. It is empirically confirmed that a high percentage of individual post-hoc matching can only be achieved when the differences in prognostic baseline variables between individually matched subjects within the same pair are sufficiently large and that the unmatched subjects are qualitatively different to the matched ones. It is concluded that the post-hoc individual matching as a technique for treatment effect estimation in parallel-group RCTs should be exercised with caution because of its propensity to introduce significant bias and reduce validity. If used with appropriate caution and thorough evaluation, this approach can complement other viable alternative approaches for estimating the treatment effect. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) is a collaborative supply chain management practice adopted by many organisations. For making inventoryrelated decisions an accurate forecast is needed. Traditional forecasting models provide close but not accurate forecasts. In the recent years, decision support tools, like neural networks, are used for making an accurate forecast. This paper presents a case study of a small enterprise where a vendor-managed inventory pact was in force between enterprise and a retailer. In the study, various neural networks were used for demand forecasting. The results of neural network based forecasts are found and compared on various fronts. Multi-criteria decision-making tools are adopted for comparing and verifying the results. Study shows that even small enterprise could adopt the simple VMI system by using properly trained neural network and obtain substantial saving in inventory and costs.

N2  - ? 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.Classifier ensembles appeared to be powerful alternative for handling a difficult problem. It is rapidly growing and enjoying many attentions from pattern recognition and machine learning communities. In the present report, the potential of multi-criteria decision making via multiclassifier approaches is assessed by applying them in the modeling of chemicals against hyper-pigmentation. TOMOCOMD-CARDD atom-based quadratic indices are used as descriptors to parameterize the molecular structures. Support vector machine, artificial neural network, Bayesian network, binary logistic regression, instance-based learning and tree classification applied on two collected datasets are explored as standalone classifiers. Prediction sets (PSs) are used to assess the performance of multiclassifier systems (MCSs). A strategy exploiting the principal component analysis together with pairwise diversity measures is designed to select the most diverse base classifiers to combine. Various trainable and nontrainable systems are developed that aggregate, at the abstract and continuous levels, the outputs of base classifiers. The obtained results are rather encouraging since the MCSs generally enhance the performance of the base classifiers; e.g. the best MCS obtains global accuracy of 95.51%, 88.89% in the PS for the data I and II in regard to 94.12% and 85.93% of best individual classifier, respectively. Our results suggest that the MCSs could be the best choice till the moment to obtain suitable QSAR models for the prediction of depigmenting agents. Finally, we consider these approaches will aid improving the virtual screening procedures and increasing the practicality of data mining of chemical datasets for the discovery of novel lead compounds.

N2  - In order to solve the problem of multi-objective optimization in green design, one solution and decision model integrating neural network and ant colony optimization (ACO) is proposed. This model takes the mechanical property, process performance, economic property, life cycle and environmental property of the material as the optimization objective, utilizes artificial neural network to conduct system modeling, finds the fitness function and method to seek the objective function value and then uses ACO to make multi-objective optimization. Ecological index approach is adopted to analyze quantitatively the influence of material on the environment within its life cycle. The selection of shell material for certain washing machine is taken as example, proving that this multi-objective decision model plays an important instructive role in material selection in green design.

N2  - In this article, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are employed for multi-objective Pareto optimum design of group method data handling (GMDH)-type neural networks that have been used for fatigue life modelling and prediction of unidirectional (UD) carbon-fibre-reinforced plastics (CFRP) composites using input-output experimental data. The input parameters used for such modelling are stress ratio, cyclic strain energy, fibre orientation angle, maximum stress, and failure stress levelin one cycle. In this way, EAs with a new encoding scheme are first presented fore volutionary design of the generalized GMDH-type neural networks,inwhich the connectivity configurations in such networks are not limited to adjacent layers. Second, multi-objective EAs with a new diversity preserving mechanism are used for Pareto optimization of such GMDH-type neural networks. The important conflicting objectives of GMDH-type neural networks that are consideredin this work are training error(TE), prediction error (PE), and number of neurons (N). Different pairs of these objective functions are selected for two-objective optimization processes. Therefore, optimal Pareto fronts of such models are obtained in each case, which exhibit the trade-offs between the corresponding pair of conflicting objectives and, thus, provide different non-dominated optimal choices of GMDH-type neuralnetwork model for fatigue life of UDCFRP composites. Moreover, all the three objectives are considered in a three-objective optimization process, which consequently leads to some more non-dominated choices of GMDH-type models representing the trade-offs among the TE, PE, and N (complexity of network), simultaneously. The comparison graphs of these Pareto fronts also show that the three-objective results include those of the two-objective results and, thus, provide more optimal choices for the multi-objective design of GMDH-type neural networks.

N2  - This paper presents a novel approach to capture emerging systems behavior involving multiple performance criteria. Due to the interactions that exist among systems, engineers may be faced with a multi-objective design space that current single response data mining models do not capture. We aim to address this challenge by proposing a Multi-Response Trend Mining algorithm that simultaneously predicts multiple performance objectives by identifying the time series behavior of the individual systems. The proposed approach is a departure from conventional data mining approaches that are often limited to evaluating single response variables in a given static data set. The resulting system level predictions will serve as performance targets for next generation systems design efforts. The Multi- Response Trend Mining model can then be integrated with multi-objective engineering models during the systems design and analysis phase so that engineering design solutions better reflect emerging system performance trends. A vehicle design data set from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository is used to validate the proposed methodology and highlight the need for multi-response predictive algorithms in systems design. © 2010 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

N2  - This study presents an efficient multimaterial design optimization algorithm that is suitable for nonlinear structures. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps: conceptual design generation, clustering, and metamodel-based global optimization. The conceptual design is generated using a structural optimization algorithm for linear models or a heuristic design algorithm for nonlinear models. Then, the conceptual design is clustered into a predefined number of clusters (materials) using a machine learning algorithm. Finally, the global optimization problem aims to find the optimal material parameters of the clustered design using metamodels. The metamodels are built using sampling and cross-validation and sequentially updated using an expected improvement function until convergence. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using examples from multiple physics and compared with traditional multimaterial topology optimization (MTOP) method. The proposed approach is applied to a nonlinear, multi-objective design problems for crashworthiness.

N2  - Forecast accuracy of economic and financial processes is a popular measure for quantifying the risk in multi-criteria decision making. In this paper, we develop forecasting models based on the statistical (stochastic) methods, sometimes called as hard computing, and on the soft methods using granular computing. To illustrate the forecasting performance of these approaches the learning aspects of RBF networks are presented and an application is included. We show a new approach of function estimation for nonlinear time series model by means of a granular fuzzy logic neural network based on Gaussian activation function with cloud concept. In a comparative study is shown that the presented approach is able to model and predict the high frequency data with reasonable accuracy and more efficient than the statistical methods.

N2  - The growing demand for food has led agribusiness to become one of the main focuses of the economy. In Brazil, this market has a great impact due to the fact that the country is one of the largest producers of food and agricultural products. Moreover, the country is the largest producer and exporter of coffee worldwide. With this scenario mind, this study aims to determine which decision factors influence the quality and production of Brazilian coffee. To this end, a Multicriteria Decision-Making was conducted using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. This method adopts paritarian comparisons of several criteria based in a priority scale establish considering data analysis and expert judgments. As the result of this work, it can be emphasized that the most prominent criterion was marketing and the best alternative of the Brazilian Coffee is selling to premium market (organic/gourmet).

N2  - Taking into account the exponential growth of the number of flash-floods events worldwide, the detection of areas prone to these natural hazards is one of the main activities taken in order to mitigate the negative effects of these risk phenomena. In the present paper, new modeling approaches, Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) integrated with IOE (ADT-IOE) and ADT integrated with AHP (ADT-AHP), were proposed for flash-flood susceptibility mapping across the Suha river catchment (Romania). Besides, two stand-alone methods, Index of Entropy (IOE) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), were also investigated. For this regard, 111 torrential points and 111 non-torrential points along with 8 flash-flood conditioning factors have been involved in the training process of the four models. The quality of the flash-flood models was checked by using the ROC Curve method, classification accuracy (CLA), and Kappa index. The result shows that the two ensemble models, the ADT-IOE (AUC = 0.972, CLC = 86.37%, Kappa statistics = 0.727) and the ADT-AHP (AUC = 0.926, CLA = 87.88%, Kappa statistics = 0.758), have high prediction performance and outperform the other models. Therefore, ADT-IOE and ADT-AHP are new and promising tools for flash-flood susceptibility modeling.

N2  - Emerging environmental threats such as novel chemical compounds, biological agents, and nanomaterials present serious challenges to traditional models of risk analysis and regulatory risk management processes. Even a massive expansion of risk and life-cycle assessment research efforts is unlikely to keep pace with rapid technological change resulting in new and modified materials with changing properties. Therefore, it is essential to have a framework for interpreting available information in the context of high uncertainty and a strategy for prioritizing research efforts to reduce those uncertainties that are most critical. We discuss how integrating the three analytic approaches of risk assessment, life-cycle assessment, and multicriteria decision analysis into a framework permits understanding uncertainty and prioritizes needs for scientific research. Our approach is illustrated with two separate cases: nanomaterials and contaminated sediment remediation. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

N2  - This study aimed to forecast air concentrations of CO in Tehran. This research is an analytical–practical method using daily data from Tehran’s air quality monitoring stations, weather parameters, time parameters such as 1-day time delay and traffic parameters, the prediction model of air pollution caused by Tehran metropolitan transport. To apply in the decision support system, it was investigated. In the multi-criteria decision-making process, the importance of evaluation indicators is usually taken into account. Gray relationship analysis was used to rank the influencing parameters in air pollution. After estimating the effective parameters, an artificial neural network model was used to forecast the CO concentration using MATLAB software. In the end, the results of an artificial neural network model were compared with the linear regression model. Correlation coefficient and mean square error of the neural network model R = 0.72 and RMSE = 0.69 with linear regression model of R = 0.10 and RMSE = 11.747 were compared. The results of this study showed that the neural network model error is less than the linear regression model. Based on the results of sensitivity analysis, hot/cold season parameters, 1-day delay, 2-day delay, day of year, and month of the year have the most effect on the concentration of CO in Tehran.

N2  - The volume and availability of business and finance data may continue to increase in the near future. However, the utility of such data is by no means straightforward due to a lack of integration between data-driven techniques and usual decision-making processes. This paper aims to integrate data with multiobjective decision-making in cash management by means of machine learning. To this end, we first consider cash flow forecasting as a data-driven procedure to be used as a key input to multiobjective cash management problem in which both cost and risk are goals to minimize. Next, we compute the forecasting premium, namely, how much value can be achieved in exchange of predictive accuracy. Finally, we provide cash managers with a general methodology to improve decision-making in cash management through the use of data and machine learning techniques. This methodology is based on a novel closed-loop procedure in which the estimated forecasting premium (if any) is used as a critical feedback information to find better forecasting models and, ultimately, better cost-risk results in cash management.

N2  - The advance of science and technology has motivated to face new and more complex engineering applications. These new challenges must involve not only the design of adaptive and dynamic systems but also the use of correct information. Everyday, it is more evident that good multicriteria decision making systems require different types of information; therefore data fusion is becoming a paramount point in the design of multicriteria decision making systems. This chapter presents a scenery recognition system for robot navigation using a neural network hierarchical approach. The system is based on information fusion in indoor scenarios. The neural systems consist on two levels. The first level is built with one neural network and the second level with two. The system extracts relevant information with respect to color and landmarks. Color information is related mainly to localization of doors. Landmarks are related to corner detection. The hierarchical neural system, based on feedforward architectures, presents 90% of correct recognition in the first level in training, and 95% in validation. The first ANN in the second level shows 90.90% of correct recognition during training, and 87.5% in validation. The second ANN has a performance of 93.75% and 91.66% during training and validation, respectively. The total performance of the systems was 86.6% during training, and 90% in validation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Environmental managers must make decisions about complex problems that have a high degree of uncertainty such as, which nutrient abatement measure optimally improves the condition of an ecosystem. Although data and models that provide information on this subject exist, their knowledge may be fragmentCPy and difficult to interpret. We present a user-friendly modelling tool that integrates results of different models and data-analyses. It can be used by decision-makers for assessing the probabilities of different nutrient abatement scenCPios for achieving specific tCPgets set by the Water Framework Directive for Finnish coastal waters in the Gulf of Finland. The results suggest that significant reductions in nutrient loads CPe required to achieve good ecological status in Finnish coastal waters, and in the event of increased precipitation these tCPgets may be less likely to be attained. Moreover, different approaches to the status classification lead to very different conclusions. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

N2  - Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a decision-making process in which decision criteria are defined; weights are given to each criterion to reflect the relative importance of each criterion; evidence for the criteria are scored; and weighted preference scores are derived based on the criteria weights and criteria score.. A decision criterion is implemented as an element od image/object recognition. Unlike in a classical MCDA, the two modifications are implemented: a learning process supported by a user and weight adjustment performed similar to the Adaline and SOM artificial neural networks. A code has been developed and a method has been successfully implemented. As an application example both programs are recognizing a wide group of fruits and vegetables, where picture properties and physical properties have been used as recognition criteria.

N2  - Cloud Services remain one of the largest segments in the world because it has experienced very rapid growth published, which makes the service selection and recommendation a difficult task for users and service providers, evenly they are a big growth opportunity for companies. For this reason, how to select the best and optimal services will be a great challenge. In this paper we present a new approach for Cloud service selection. We use a top K query, which returns k services that dominate the largest number of services returned by the Skyline query. This request is based on a method that is among the most important and commonly used to compute scoring functions: The weighted sum method, also called linear. Our application is an important decision support tool, because it provides an efficient decision making tool to help decision makers to meet the most suitable services to their preferences. In addition, it combines the advantages of Top-k and Skyline queries without sharing their disadvantages. On the other hand, our results on real data show the relevance of this designed specific algorithm and fully exploit the characteristics of the problem.

N2  - For a centralized retail chain where everything is controlled centrally for all the outlets, to monitor the performances of all outlets and identify the problems in product level, is difficult than in a decentralized retail chain. A centralized retail chain having twenty-two outlets and eight thousand six hundred and ninety-three unique products, has been considered for this study. In this paper, we used K-mean clustering as a machine learning tool to cluster the outlets from where we measured each cluster's performance. To further analyze at product level, we used analytical hierarchy process (AHP), as multi criteria decision-making technique, for cluster wise inventory classification. Revenue per square foot and average basket value for each cluster, is the basic performance indicator. From basic performance indicator, decision makers can get an idea about which cluster needs immediate attention. This will lead them to investigate that cluster's class wise inventory situation for performance improvement.

N2  - Today technology that learns from data to forecast future behavior of individuals, organizations, government and country as a whole, is playing a crucial role in the advancement of human race. In fact, the strategic advantage most of the companies today strive for are use of new available technologies like cloud computing and big data. However, today’s dynamic business environment poses severe challenges in front of companies as to how to make use of the power of big data with the technical flexibility that cloud computing provides? Therefore, evaluating, ranking and selecting the most appropriate cloud solution to manage big data project is a complex concern which required multi criteria decision environment. In this paper we propose a hybrid TOPSIS method combined with intuitionistic fuzzy set to select appropriate cloud solution to manage big data projects in group decision making environment. In order to collate individual opinions of decision makers for rating the importance of various criteria and alternatives, we employed intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging operator. Lastly sensitivity analysis is performed so as to evaluate the impact of criteria weights on final ranking of alternatives.

N2  - Background: Cities around the world face a great challenge in establishing a long-term strategy for the development of energy alternatives. Previous research tried to identify renewable energy across many different cities. Because each city has unique characteristics in terms of geographic and environmental conditions, population, economic development, and social and political environment, the most sustainable energy source for one city might be the least sustainable for another. Methods: This research develops and implements a systematic approach to assess renewable energy and identify the energy alternatives for a city using the analytic hierarchy process. The methodology integrates experts' input and data analytics and helps decision-makers form long-term strategies for renewable energy development. Results: The decision support system is applied to three cities, Chengdu in China, Eskisehir in Turkey, and Chicago in the United States of America. Results show that improving energy efficiency and development of solar and wind energy are the most preferred energy alternatives whereas nuclear and hydroelectric are the least preferred energy alternatives for these three cities. Conclusions: The results of this study are in line with decades of research and development in energy alternatives and show a clear direction for the future development of energy alternatives around the world. There are differences in the rankings of energy alternatives for different cities, indicating that it is necessary to apply the decision support system developed in this study to help form customized energy strategies for cities with unique characteristics.

N2  - Reaching a decision when multiple, possibly conflicting, criteria are taken into account is often a difficult task. This normally requires the intervention of an analyst to aid the decision maker in following a clear methodology with respect to the steps that need to be taken, as well as the use of different algorithms and software tools. Most of these tools focus on one or a small number of algorithms, some are difficult to adapt and interface with other tools, while only a few belong to dynamic communities of contributors allowing them to expand in use and functionality. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing to use the R statistical environment and the MCDA package of decision aiding algorithms and tools. This package is meant to provide a wide range of MCDA algorithms that may be used by an analyst to tailor a decision aiding process to their needs, while the choice of R takes advantage of the yet poorly explored opportunity to interface data analysis and decision aiding. We additionally demonstrate the use of this tool on a practical application following a well-defined decision aiding process.

N2  - For determining optimal operation policies, it is of vital importance to the structural stability of dams, besides meeting the downstream water demands during the operation period. Since water level variations in upstream dam cause changes in loadings of the dam body, ignoring factors, which are effective in the structural stability of dams, might result in cracks and instability of dams in the long term. Therefore, in the present study, a multi-objective model was developed by integrating the reservoir structure simulation model and optimization approach in order to meet water supply demands and maintain the dam structural stability. Linear static analysis of Amir Kabir dam was performed using ABAQUS 6.14.3 software to extract the structural parameters, indicating the dam structural stability. For this purpose, a dynamic artificial neural network was also used as an interfaced model to relate the results of the simulator model to those of the proposed approach. The best solution was extracted from the optimal trade-off curve, which was developed using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and multi-criteria decision-making methods. Results showed that the allocation to the downstream water demands was applied in the best possible way based on the stability of the dam. A comparison between the existing and optimal conditions indicated that the value of reliability and vulnerability coefficients was improved in optimal conditions in comparison with the existing conditions. According to the results, there was a 7% rise in the fuzzy stability index in optimal conditions compared to the existing conditions that indicate better performance in the optimal model. Therefore, as to consider the downstream water demands, summer was the most deficient and spring was the least deficient with the water supply of 30% and 72%, respectively. During summer, the average optimal allocation and the average demand were 20.51 MCM and 67.50 MCM, respectively. However, this season showed the best performance in preserving the dam stability with having the lowest parameters of the dam structural stability compared to other seasons. Finally, the support vector regression method was used to develop an optimal operational policy based on optimal allocation values obtained from the proposed model structure. The optimal developed policy can be used to determine optimal allocation based on hydrological parameters of the dam and its water demands. Meanwhile, it can maintain dam stability without implementing the proposed structure.

N2  - Risk management is a vital factor for ensuring better quality software development processes. Moreover, risks are the events that could adversely affect the organization activities or the development of projects. Effective prioritization of software project risks play a significant role in determining whether the project will be successful in terms of performance characteristics or not. In this work, we develop a new hybrid fuzzy-based machine learning mechanism for performing risk assessment in software projects. This newly developed hybridized risk assessment scheme can be used to determine and rank the significant software project risks that support the decision making during the software project lifecycle. For better assessment of the software project risks, we have incorporated fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-based multi-criteria decision making (ANFIS MCDM) and intuitionistic fuzzy-based TODIM (IF-TODIM) approaches. More significantly, for the newly introduced ANFIS MCDM approach, the parameters of ANFIS are adjusted using a traditional crow search algorithm (CSA) which applies only a reasonable as well as small changes in variables. The main activity of CSA in ANFIS is to find the best parameter to achieve most accurate software risk estimate. Experimental validation was conducted on NASA 93 dataset having 93 software project values. The result of this method exhibits a vivid picture that provides software risk factors that are key determinant for achievement of the project performance. Experimental outcomes reveal that our proposed integrated fuzzy approaches can exhibit better and accurate performance in the assessment of software project risks compared to other existing approaches.

N2  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a methodology to assist small automobile manufacturing companies of India in selecting CAD/CAM system. The use of these tools in design and manufacturing of automobile applications makes it possible to remove much of the tedium and manual labor work involved. They allow complex designs to be made quicker and accurately. Many companies are using obsolete packages to design and manufacture automobiles. Since technology is changing rapidly and most companies cannot update with the technology advancements. They need to know what CAD/CAM packages are available and how to select one will help the companies. The selection of CAD/CAM/CIM tool/package is multi criteria, multi attribute, decision making process which involve many factors that can be solved using NAHP (Neuro Analytical Hierarchy Process). In NAHP, we are combining the power of AHP and Neural Network. To accomplish this purpose, data have been collected about current CAD/CAM systems. Important criteria for system selection and parameters for selection have also been identified and prioritized. NAHP is used as decision making technique to identify and prioritize important factors for selection of CAD/CAM/CIM system for small automobile manufacturing companies of India. © 2012 IEEE.

As one of the most efficient approach, the MCDM applications can provide the ability to formulate and systematically compare different alternatives against the large sets of design criteria. However, the mechanical behavior of woven textiles during the draping process has not been yet fully integrated to the optimal design approaches of MCDM algorithms. In this article the criteria of mechanical behavior of the woven textile during the draping and the further involved simulations and analysis are included in the process of the optimal design and decision making. For this reason an advanced software architecture for interactive optimization and MCDM is utilized. In this software the identified challenges of utilizing MCDM are improved via connecting the data mining/visualization and optimization through the user interaction.

N2  - Many real-world tasks require making sequential decisions that involve multiple conflicting objectives. Furthermore, there exist multiple decision-makers, called multiagent, each of whom pursues its own profit. Thus, each agent should take into account the effect of other agents ' decisions to reach a point of compromise. For example, each agent decides with thought of other agents ' behavior in the decision of selecting the faster driving route to the destination, selecting a supermarket checkout line, and so on. For solving a sequential multi-objective decision problem, a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) approach has been investigated.However, current research on MORL cannot deal with the multi-agent system where existing agents are influenced one another. Therefore, in this study, we expand the conventional multi-objective reinforcement learning by introducing the idea of multi-objectivization with dynamic weight setting of other decision-makers. In an experiment, our proposed model with dynamic weight can express the cooperative behaviors that seems to be considered other decision-makers in the multiagent environment.

N2  - Purpose - As the modern manufacturing twining seamlessly with logistics operations for value adding services, logistics service is becoming more and more significant. Under this research background, the purpose of this paper is to introduce an innovative evaluation model for customer satisfaction using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). Design/methodology/approach - This model uses triangular fuzzy concept to determine the weight of each index so that subjective or objective weighting is addressed. A case study from two large express companies in China is used to demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed model for examining customer satisfaction. Findings - One of the key findings is that Company B has higher customer satisfaction than Company A due to its quick response and flexible logistics strategy. This paper has several contributions. First, A FAHP-based customer satisfaction evaluation model is proposed for the logistics service. Second, the triangular fuzzy concept is introduced to determine the weight of each index so as to addresses the limitation of subjective or objective weighting method. Third, a case study demonstrates the implementation of the model. Research limitations/implications - First, this paper considers the fuzzy AHP for the customer satisfaction evaluation. Comparing with other multi-criteria decision-making methods like data envelopment analysis, evidential reasoning approach , and multi-attribute value theory will be carried out in the near future. Second, the manufacturing modes like make-to-order, make-to-stock, and masscustomized production may have different logistics support so that the final products may reach the final targets quickly. How to evaluate various mode-based logistics and their customer satisfactions have great significance. Finally, Big Data-enabled customer satisfaction evaluation approaches may be a possible solution. Practical implications - Based on the data from questionnaire, it is found that, in practical applications, manufacturing enterprises should amend the index system according to the specific business scope and the production characteristics. Manufacturing enterprises need to collect large amounts of data through market research and conduct the measurement on the related coefficient between the measurement indicators and customer satisfaction degree. After that, they can make sorting and filtering on the measurement index according to the measurement results. Social implications - Customer satisfaction is very important to manufacturing and logistics enterprises due to its time constraints. The physical products with services like logistics are paid close attention to by the final customers. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is as follows: a FAHP-based customer satisfaction evaluation model is proposed for the logistics service; triangular fuzzy concept is introduced to determine the weight of each index so as to addresses the limitation of subjective or objective weighting method; a case study was used to demonstrate the implementation of the model. One of the key findings is that Company B has higher customer satisfaction than Company B due to its quick response and flexible logistics strategy.

N2  - The Energy Performance of Building Directive obligated all European countries to reduce the energy requirements of buildings while simultaneously improving indoor environment quality. Any such improvements not only enhance the health of the occupants and their productivity, but also provide further economic benefits at the national level. Accomplishing this task requires a method that allows building professionals to resolve conflicts between visual and thermal comfort, energy demands, and life-cycle costs. To overcome these conflicts, this study exploits the incorporation of building information modelling (BIM), the design of experiments as an optimization algorithm, and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) into a multi-criteria decision-making method. Any such incorporation can (i) create constructive communication between building professionals, such as architects, engineers, and energy experts; (ii) allow the analysis of the performance of multiple construction solutions with respect to visual and thermal comfort, energy demand, and life-cycle costs; and (iii) help to select a trade-off solution, thereby making a suitable decision. Three types of energy-efficient windows, and five types of ground floors, roofs, and external wall constructions were considered as optimization variables. The incorporation of several methods allowed the analysis of the performance of 375 construction solutions based on a combination of optimization variables, and helped to select a trade-off solution. The results showed the strength of incorporation for analyzing big-data through the intelligent use of BIM and a simulation in the field of the built environment, energy, and costs. However, when applying AHP, the results are strongly contingent on pairwise comparisons.

N2  - The supplier selection is a multi-criteria decision making process determined by a comparison of suppliers using a shared set of characteristics. The adequate selection of suppliers makes a strategic difference to an organization’s ability to reduce cost and improve the quality of its product. Social media has become a relevant source of information within the supply chain, this vast portfolio of data can assist in the supplier selection process by providing relevant and up-to-date information regarding the different risks suppliers might present. This research proposes Twitter Enabled Supplier Status Assessment (TESSA) that assists in the supplier selection process by assessing the risks and uncertainty each supplier holds. We aim to open a new window on the research field regarding supplier selection, as a result, companies can be more prone to exploit the extensive data social networks has to offer and utilize it in the decision making process.

N2  - A huge amount of data is being collected and stored by financial institutions like banks during their operations. These data contain the most important facts about the institutions and its customers. A good and efficient data analytics system can find patterns in this huge data source that can be used in actionable knowledge creation. Actionable knowledge is the knowledge that can be put to decision making and take some positive action towards better performance of organizations. This actionable knowledge is termed Business Intelligence by data scientists. Business Intelligence and Analytics is the process of applying data mining techniques to organizational or corporate data to discover patterns. Business Intelligence and Business Analytics are emerging as important and essential fields both for data scientists and organizations. Risk analysis, fraud detection, customer retention, customer satisfaction analysis and actuarial analysis are some of the areas of application of business intelligence and analytics. Credit risk analysis is an important part of a successful financial institution particularly in the banking sector. The current study takes this risk analysis in financial institutions and reviews the state of the art in using data analytics or data mining techniques for financial risk analysis. The analysis of risk from financial data depends on several factors that are both objective and subjective. Hence it is a multi-criteria decision problem. The study also proposes a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) for analyzing financial data for risk analysis and prediction. The proposed MOGA is different from other evolutionary systems in that a memory component to hold the rules is added to the system while other systems in the literature are memory less. The algorithm is applied to bench mark data sets for predicting the decision on credit card and credit applications. The preliminary results are encouraging and show light towards better decision making in reducing risks.

N2  - Computational intelligence techniques are very useful tools for solving problems that involve understanding, modeling, and analyzing large data sets. One of the numerous fields where computational intelligence has found an extremely important role is finance. More precisely, the problem of selecting an investment portfolio to guarantee a given return, at a minimal risk, have been solved using intelligent techniques such as support-vector machines, neural networks, rule-based expert systems, and genetic algorithms. Even though these methods provide good and usually fast approximation of the best investment strategy, they suffer some common drawbacks including the neglect of the dependence among criteria characterizing investment assets (i.e. return, risk, etc.), the ignorance of the interdependence among assets, and the assumption that all available data are precise and certain. To face these weaknesses, we suggest the use of utility-based multi-criteria decision making setting and fuzzy integration over intervals.

N2  - The hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) is very significant in dealing with the multi-criteria decision-making problems when the decision makers have hesitancy in providing their assessments. However, with the deepening of the research, it may lose information in its applications. Hence, the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (P-HFS) has been proposed to improve the HFS, associating the probability with the HFS and remaining more information than the HFS. Considering the correlation coefficient is one of the most important tools in data analysis, we propose two new correlation coefficient formulas to measure the relationship between the P-HFSs, based on which, a new probabilistic hesitant fuzzy clustering algorithm is also developed. To do so, we define the mean of the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy element and the P-HFS, respectively. Furthermore, a practical case study is conducted to demonstrate practicability and validity of the proposed clustering algorithm.

N2  - This paper is a case study that presents a comparison between portfolio planning and portfolio implementation in Tanzania power sector and suggests a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, which can be considered as a balanced approach in minimizing the discrepancy between portfolio planning and implementation. The research is chiefly developed based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach, and the subsequent data collection and data analysis were tailored to suit this approach. An extensive literature review ranging from various scholar papers to corporate research reports is undertaken to establish the most relevant project appraisal criteria in Tanzania power industry. A total of 15 experts, took part in the survey in which the survey findings were integrated into the literature review toward structuring the proposed MCDM framework. The analysis of findings suggest the following insights; (1) inadequate cross-stakeholders engagement at portfolio planning stage observed in Tanzania power sector which is largely due to the confined and quantitative portfolio planning method; (2) MCDM should be used as a complementary method toward integrating non-tangible/qualitative variables into other quantitative criteria at the portfolio planning stage, which can mitigate the extent of deviation between portfolio planning and implementation; (3) It is crucial to employ MCMD as a decision support tool toward prioritizing major infrastructure projects at the portfolio planning stage to ensure the consistency between portfolio planning and implementation.

N2  - Saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers poses significant challenges in the management of vulnerable coastal groundwater resources around the world. To develop a strategy for regional scale sustainable management of coastal aquifers, solution of large-scale multi-objective decision models is essential. The flow and solute transport equations are also density dependent, where the flow parameters are dependent on salt concentration; hence, the flow and solute transport equations need to be solved as coupled equations. In a linked optimization simulation model, the numerical simulation model as a predictor of the physical processes need to be solved enormous number of times to be able to identify an optimum solution as per the specified objectives and constraints. This problem becomes even more complicated when multiple objectives are included and the Pareto optimal solutions need to be determined. Therefore, to ensure the computational efficiency and feasibility of determining a regional scale strategy for control and sustainable use of a coastal aquifer, meta-models that are trained, tested and validated using randomized solutions of the numerical simulation models can be utilized. These meta-models once trained and tested serves the purpose of an approximate emulator of the complex numerical models rendering the solution of a complex and large scale linked optimization model computationally efficient and feasible. The optimal groundwater extraction patterns can be obtained through linked simulation-optimization (S/O) technique in which the simulation part is usually replaced by computationally efficient meta-models. This study proposes a computationally efficient meta-model to emulate density reliant integrated flow and solute transport scenarios of coastal aquifers. A meta-model, Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is trained and developed for an illustrative coastal aquifer study area. Prediction accuracy of the developed ANFIS based meta-model is evaluated for suitability. The meta-model is then integrated with a multiple objective coastal aquifer management model to demonstrate the potential application of this methodology. The optimization algorithm utilized for solution is the Controlled Elitist Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm. Performance evaluation results show acceptable accuracy in the obtained optimized management strategies. Therefore, use of trained and tested meta-models linked to an optimization model results in significant computational efficacy. It also ensures computational practicability of solving such large-scale integrated S/O approach for regional scale coastal groundwater management.

N2  - This paper proposes a novel multicriteria decision making (MCDM) method using the TOPSIS method and similarity measures between intuitionistic fuzzy values. First, it calculates the degree of indeterminacy (DOI) of each evaluating intuitionistic fuzzy value (IFV) given by the decision maker. Then, it calculates the DOI of the relative positive ideal value (RPIV) and the relative negative ideal value (RNIV) for each criterion, respectively. Then, it calculates the positive similarity degrees and the negative similarity degrees. Finally, it calculates the weighted positive score and the weighted negative score of each alternative, respectively, to get the relative degree of closeness of each alternative. The advantage of the proposed MCDM method is that it can overcome the drawbacks of the existing MCDM methods for MCDM in intuitionistic fuzzy environments.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is twofold: the selection of project portfolios through hybrid artificial neural network algorithms, feature selection based on grey relational analysis, decision tree and regression; and the identification of the features affecting project portfolio selection using the artificial neural network algorithm, decision tree and regression. The authors also aim to classify the available options using the decision tree algorithm. Design/methodology/approach: In order to achieve the research goals, a project-oriented organization was selected and studied. In all, 49 project management indicators were chosen from A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide), and the most important indicators were identified using a feature selection algorithm and decision tree. After the extraction of rules, decision rule-based multi-criteria decision making matrices were produced. Each matrix was ranked through grey relational analysis, similarity to ideal solution method and multi-criteria optimization. Finally, a model for choosing the best ranking method was designed and implemented using the genetic algorithm. To analyze the responses, stability of the classes was investigated. Findings: The results showed that projects ranked based on neural network weights by the grey relational analysis method prove to be better options for the selection of a project portfolio. The process of identification of the features affecting project portfolio selection resulted in the following factors: scope management, project charter, project management plan, stakeholders and risk. Originality/value: This study presents the most effective features affecting project portfolio selection which is highly impressive in organizational decision making and must be considered seriously. Deploying sensitivity analysis, which is an innovation in such studies, played a constructive role in examining the accuracy and reliability of the proposed models, and it can be firmly argued that the results have had an important role in validating the findings of this study.

N2  - The evaluation of the severity of partial discharge is a multi-objective decision problem. Considering the non-linear relationship among the different characteristic parameters, it is the core of this paper to extract the partial discharge characteristic parameters and evaluate the severity. The experimental results show that the development process of partial discharge of solid insulation switchgear under typical gap defects has been studied experimentally, and the φ-u scatter plot and φ-n spectrum of different PD stages have been constructed. Extracting nine feature parameters to characterize the severity of PD, and the physical meaning of each characteristic parameter and the partial development stage are analyzed. The results show that the partial characteristic parameter value interval is put down in different degree,and the neural network algorithm is used to construct of judgment system for severity of partial discharge in solid insulated switchgear, which avoids only considering the single factor leads to the irrationality of the judgment result. Finally, the correctness and validity of the method are verified by an example test.

N2  - Water resources planning and management require problem resolution and optimized use of resources. Since many objectives in water management are conflicting, it is hard to devise one optimum strategy. A simulation tool capable of optimized multi-objective analysis to satisfy a multiplicity of goals is needed to support water decision making. This paper suggests an integrated modelling framework to assist with time consuming and difficult tasks of decision making by water management practitioners and to harmonize economic uses of water resources. Motivated machine learning, presented in this paper, supports intelligent decision-making processes in dynamically changing environments and could be used to consider alternative water management policies. Motivated learning systems learn to properly control the environment with competing goals. They provide a natural support for multi-objective decision making in an active search for balance between conflicting situations and adverse environmental conditions. A case study of optimized machine learning water management decisions is presented. Copyright © 2010 IAHS Press.

N2  - Change detection of ground surface objects can provide essential and precious information for experts in the fields of Geomatics, emergency management, urban management, agriculture, and forestry. Space-borne remote-sensing images are one of the main sources for change detection. Various change detection methods have been proposed on remote-sensing applications. However, often, no single efficient method can be selected for a case study because the existing methods sometimes have good performance and sometimes perform poorly. Therefore, it is necessary to propose an integrated change detection method according to some change detection methods. Multi-criteria decision analysis is a powerful framework that can integrate several criteria that may be in contrast to each other. In this study, a multi-criteria decision analysis framework was used to integrate the spectral, textural, and transformed features for detecting building changes with the help of high spatial resolution satellite images. First, the spectral, textural, and transformed features were extracted from the pre- and post-event satellite images. Second, the spectral, textural, and transformed factor maps were produced by entering the related features to three separate Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS). Third, the ANFIS model was used again to integrate the mentioned factor maps for producing the preliminary building change map. And finally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the proper parameters of the ANFIS models leading to accurate change detection results. The proposed method was tested on the earthquake data set of Bam City in Iran. The achieved results indicated an overall accuracy of 89.62% for identifying the changed and unchanged building regions. Moreover, the obtained results proved the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method with respect to other implemented methods regarding the Bam earthquake. Furthermore, the aggregation of the spectral, transformed, and textural features resulted in improving the change detection accuracy by about 5–15%, compared with the accuracy of every one of them for the mentioned purpose.

N2  - Background: This paper presents the methodology for assessing and selecting the most appropriate procedure for the preparation of nanoparticles by implementing the analytical network process. The commonly utilized nanoparticle preparation methods are Polymer Precipitation, Interfacial polymer deposition, Complex Coacervation, Cross linking, Emulsion solvent diffusion, Homogenization and Polymerization method. There are numerous parameters to be considered in groundwork of nanoparticles that departs the conclusion manufacturer in bias. One has to address a number of components in alignment to determine and choose the optimum conclusion choices, because an unsuitable conclusion could lead to the eventual merchandise having to be formulated and developed again. For this cause in this paper, we study selecting the most appropriate procedure for the preparation of nanoparticles utilizing one of the multi criteria-decision making techniques, Analytic Network Process. Methodology. The main goal was determined. The criteria and sub-criteria that affect the main goal were determined. The alternatives for the problem were determined. The interactions between criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives respect to the main goal were determined. The super matrixes according to the network were assembled and then weighted super matrix and limit super matrix were then constructed. The values of this limit matrix are the desired priorities of the elements with respect to the goal. The alterative with the highest priority was finally chosen as the best alternative. Results: The emulsion solvent diffusion technique (M-5) has the highest value (0.434379) among the alternative methods that are applicable to the preparation of the nanoparticles. The second highest is Polymer Precipitation (M-1) with a value of 0.178798, and the lowest value or last choice is Cross Linking (M-4) with a value of only 0.024516. The alternative with the highest priority would achieve the goal, i.e., the best method for the preparation of the nanoparticles. Conclusion: The alternative M5 emulsion solvent diffusion technique, scoring 0.434379 was the one with largest main concern amidst all the other alternatives and thereby judged to be the most apt procedure for the preparation of nanoparticles. © 2012 Velmurugan and Selvamuthukumar; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - This study presents an approach for ranking the alternative solutions based on ideal values of criteria. For this purpose, a group multi criteria decision making (GMCDM) model is presented with combination of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods. The proposed model is capable of finding optimal solution for high-dimensional problems with simple and manual calculations. In the first stage, decision making matrix and weight vector of criteria are calculated using AHP, and in the second stage, the alternatives are ranked according to the least distances from ideal values of criteria. The model contributes to the literature by considering intangible and tangible criteria, handling opinions of multiple decision makers, solving problems with many alternatives and criteria in a short time frame, and applying source limitations as spotted to be one of the limitations of decision makers. A numerical example is presented to analyze proposed approach's effectiveness. Findings illustrate that proposed algorithm is flexible against different criteria and is capable to reach similar solutions in comparison with other MCDM methods in a short timeframe and a simplistic approach.

N2  - Offshore installation barge, one of the special offshore support units for installation of ships and offshore structures, should maintain the stability of the barge using mechanical device such as lifting system, holding clamp, spud, etc. The holding clamp for the offshore installation barge is the important device to maintain the stability as well as to mount and/or to move the spud during the installation work. Recently, various studies have been carried out to optimize the design of the mechanical devices for the offshore structures [1~2]. In this study, we performed a comparative study on the approximate multi-objective design optimization to realize the structural design to improve the weight and vibration performances of the holding clamp, which is the mechanical device for the offshore installation barge, considering the various load conditions and vibration characteristics. In the approximate multi-objective optimization process, regression meta-model was generated using response surfaces method (RSM) while Kriging and back-propagation neural network (BPN) methods were applied to interpolation meta-modeling. The Pareto solutions, multi-objective optimal solutions, were derived using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) [3]. In terms of the structure design of the holding clamp considered in this study, characteristics and influence of the metamodeling on the multi-objective optimization were reviewed through the comparison of the approximate optimization results with the meta-models and the actual optimization.

N2  - Environmental awareness has universally driven the move for sustainable supply chain management. Accordingly, manufacturing companies or organizations try to seek sustainable business strategies to respond to market pressure toward corporate social responsibility (CSR). Sustainable reverse logistics service provider selection is one of the practical strategies for competitive organizations. With the large-scale development of the automotive products industry, sustainable reverse logistics service provider evaluation method is the key for decision authority when dealing with big data information and possible risks of unstructured data. For instance, the choice of decision authority possibly may responsible for a misleading decision, thus leading to undesirable waste of less available resources and time. Therefore, the objective of present work is to apply the integrated multi-criteria decision methods using the “MOORA and WASPAS” approaches in the evaluation of third-party logistics service providers (3PRLSPs). It also incorporates the significance weight provided by SWARA technique and helps decision-makers for efficient decision-making. The proposed model is to evaluate, and criteria weight is determined using the step-wise weight assessment ratio (SWARA) approach and then ranking of the alternatives was decided by MOORA and WASPAS. The automotive parts manufacturing company may be benefited by their commitment toward environmental safety, economic, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) leading to improved brand value and sustainable business development.

N2  - In this paper, the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method weighted sum model (WSM) is applied in order to evaluate online courses uploaded in the learning management system (LMS) of the Department of Accountancy of Kavala's Institute of Technology. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test are also applied to analyse the LMS data. Seven factors are used, namely, the four-criteria TAM, quality, quantity and utilisation of e-learning platform utilities and three other attribures i.e., year of study, type of course and the mean grade at the exams. The evaluation process took place in three distinct phases. In the first phase the weights of the aforementioned first four criteria were estimated. At the second phase the students evaluated the online courses. The courses were indexed with the use of the WSM and were assigned a ranking score. After the second phase, the educators were informed about the indexing results. Most of them tried to improve their courses in terms of educational material. Two months later, the evaluation process was repeated and most of the scores were higher than the corresponding ones of the former phase. The results of both phases indicate that the TAM group criterion is considered as the most important one, whereas the utilisation as the least important.

N2  - This work introduces a new design algorithm to optimize progressively folding thin-walled structures and in order to improve automotive crashworthiness. The proposed design algorithm is composed of three stages: conceptual thickness distribution, design parameterization, and multi-objective design optimization. The conceptual thickness distribution stage generates an innovative design using a novel one-iteration compliant mechanism approach that triggers progressive folding even on irregular structures under oblique impact. The design parameterization stage optimally segments the conceptual design into a reduced number of clusters using a machine learning K-means algorithm. Finally, the multi-objective design optimization stage finds non-dominated designs of maximum specific energy absorption and minimum peak crushing force. The proposed optimization problem is addressed by a multi-objective genetic algorithm on sequentially updated surrogate models, which are optimally selected from a set of 24 surrogates. The effectiveness of the design algorithm is demonstrated on an S-rail thin-walled structure. The best compromised Pareto design increases specific energy absorption and decreases peak crushing force in the order of 8% and 12%, respectively.

N2  - This paper describes the application of an artificial neural network, genetic algorithm and analytic network process-technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution for the selection of the optimum fuel blend. A single-cylinder, constant-speed direct-injection diesel engine with a rated output of 4.4 kW was used for exploratory analysis at different load conditions. Ten objectives–brake thermal efficiency, maximum rate of pressure rise, NOx, CO2, CO, HC, smoke, exhaust gas temperature, ignition delay and combustion delay were considered. The proposed ANN model is integrated with GA and the hybrid multi-criteria decision-making technique of ANP-TOPSIS to evaluate the optimum blend. First the ANN model was developed to predict the performance, combustion and emission parameters of the engine. A multi-layer perception network was used for non-linear mapping between input and output parameters. The performance of the ANN model is determined and shows the efficiency of the model to predict the performance, emission and combustion parameters, with a determination coefficient of 0.9627. Second, GA was used to determine the optimum load and blend based on the predicted ANN output parameter. Third, an approach based on the TOPSIS method was used for finding the best blend from the observed optimum parameters of GA.

N2  - In decision making most approaches are taking into account objective criteria, however the subjective correlation among decision makers provided as preference utility is necessary to be presented to provide confidence preference additive among decision makers reducing ambiguity and produce better utility preferences measurement for subjective criteria among decision makers. Most models in Decision support systems are assuming criteria as independent. Therefore, these models are ranking alternatives based on objective data analysis. Also, different type of data (time series, linguistic values, interval data, etc.) imposes some difficulties to do decision making using classical multi criteria decision making models. Sophisticated machine learning methods to estimate or extract emotions from the content created by users has been developed including support vector machines, Bayesian networks, maximum entropy approaches and concept level analysis of natural language text, supported by combinations of common-sense reasoning. These approaches are mainly based on language text processing with sufficient documents, which is usually inlarge is not available. We think Subjectiveness is related to the contextual form of criteria. Uncertainty of some criteria in decision making is also considered as other important aspect These draw backs in decision making are major research challenges that are attracting wide attention, like on big data analysis for risk prediction, medical diagnosis and other applications that are in practice more subjective to user situation and its knowledge related context. Subjectivity would be examined based on correlations between different contextual structures that is reflecting the framework of personal context, for example in nearest neighbor based correlation analysis fashion. Some of the attributes incompleteness also may lead to affect the approximation accuracy. Attributes with preference-ordered domain relations properties become one aspect in ordering properties in rough approximations. The Virtual Doctor System (VDS) developed by my group is a system assisting human doctor who is practicing medical diagnosis in real situation and environment. The interoperability is represented by utilizing the medical diagnosis cases of medical doctor, represented in machine executable fashion based on human patient interaction with virtual avatar resembling a real doctor. VDS is practiced as a virtual avatar interacting with the human patient based on physical views and mental view analysis. In this talk I outline our VDS system and then discuss related issues in subjective decision making in medical domain. Using fuzzy reasoning techniques in VDS, it has been shown that it is possible to provide better precision in circumstances that is related to partial known data and uncertainty on the acquisition of medical symptoms.

N2  - This study deals with passenger side restraint system design for frontal impact and four impact modes are considered in optimization. The objective is to minimize the Relative Risk Score (RRS), defined by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NTHSA)'s New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). At the same time, the design should satisfy various injury criteria including HIC, chest deflection/acceleration, neck tension/compression, etc., which ensures the vehicle meeting or exceeding all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 208 requirements. The design variables include airbag firing time, airbag vent size, inflator power level, retractor force level. Some of the restraint feature options (e.g., some specific features on/off) are also considered as discrete design variables. Considering the local variability of input variables such as manufacturing tolerances, the robustness and reliability of nominal designs were also taken into account in optimization process. Genetic Algorithms (GA) based optimization methods were applied because these methods can handle discrete and continuous design variables simultaneously, as well treat such highly nonlinear optimization problems in a robust manner. Frontal impact generic passenger side MADYMO models were developed to simulate the full frontal 90-degree rigid barrier scenarios at different impact speeds with a belted or an unbelted occupant. Both deterministic and robustness/reliability multi-objective optimizations were performed, and Pareto solutions were obtained. Advanced data analytics tools such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis are utilized to identify a handful representative Pareto solutions from the original large set of Pareto solutions. MCDM (Multi Criteria Decision Making) is used to rank Pareto solutions based on decision makers' preferences and help decision makers evaluate alternatives easily. This paper focuses the practices of these tools, summarizes the pros and cons of these tools, and provides helps to engineers, especially how to analyze the results from optimization and when to apply these advanced data analytics tools.

N2  - The location of wind/solar power plants is a critical part of design process. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), the well-known procedure of site selection, suffers from the local-scoring property. This paper proposes a combined approach of MCDM and artificial neural networks (ANN) to alleviate this deficiency. Here, the weighting of site selection criteria has been performed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and then a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used for implementing the global scoring capability. By using this procedure, adding any new alternative site location cannot affect the scores of the others. In other words, the proposed procedure is global-scale and robust. Scores derived by this procedure for two candidate sites can be interpreted as real differences in these sites.

N2  - Concept design requiring complicated feed-forward and feed-back processes makes it difficult for engineers to determine the global behaviors of design variables and objective functions in a design space. Although design of experiments and response surface models have been applied to overcome these problems, the design variables satisfying the objective functions can't be found due to violations of given constraints. In this study, a new optimization process, i.e., the GEO (Generate, Explore and Optimize) process for the concept design of a tactical missile, based on a MOGA (Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm) was proposed, which was first adapted to generate a Pareto Front in order to simultaneously satisfy the constraints and the objective functions. In the first step, the weights between the objective functions were determined by using an AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process). Then, the design space exploration followed, and was implemented by surrogate models constructed from the Pareto Front with a neural network. In the last step, a TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and a desirability function were applied together to determine the optimal solution. The TOPSIS merged the multi-objective design problem to a single entity, and the desirability function normalized each objective function. © 2014 Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - The aim of this research is to investigate multi-criteria decision making [spatial multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE)], bivariate statistical methods [frequency ratio (FR), index of entropy (IOE), weighted linear combination (WLC)] and machine learning [support vector machine (SVM)] models for estimating landslide susceptibility at the Wuning area, China. A total of 445 landslides were randomly classified into 70% (311 landslides) and 30% (134 landslides) to train and validate landslide models, respectively. Fourteen landslide conditioning factors including slope angle, slope aspect, altitude, topographic wetness index, stream power index, sediment transport index, soil, lithology, NDVI, land use, rainfall, distance to road, distance to river and distance to fault were then studied for landslide susceptibility assessment. Performances of five studied models were evaluated using area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for training (success rate curve) and validation (prediction rate curve) datasets, statistical-based measures and tests. Results indicated that the area under the success rate curve for the FR, IOE, WLC, SVM and SMCE models was 88.32%, 82.58%, 78.91%, 85.47% and 89.96%, respectively, demonstrating that SMCE could provide the higher accuracy. The prediction capability findings revealed that the SMCE model (AUC = 86.81%) was also the highest approach among the five studied models, followed by the FR (AUC = 84.53%), the SVM (AUC = 81.24%), the IOE (AUC = 79.67%) and WLC (73.92%) methods. The landslide susceptibility maps derived from the above five models are reasonably accurate and could be used to perform elementary land use planning for hazard extenuation.

N2  - As the initial contribution, by employing a neural network, this paper proposes a model to regulate the input voltages of the robot Robuarm based on the desired angle and angular velocity values of its joints. Robuarm is a robot with three degrees of freedom in which each joint has a motor. The proposed model demonstrates an accuracy of 99.5 percent. As the second contribution, based on the policies of focusing on energy consumption reduction, focusing on joints optimal angular velocities and focusing on the optimum angles in joints movements, a hybrid efficient method to select the optimized robot movements is proposed. The proposed method is based on using multi-objective decision-making analysis and fuzzy clustering and finally employing the proposed neural network model to find the optimal solution.

N2  - Several techniques can be used to solve multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems and to provide a global ranking of the alternatives considered. However, in a context with a high number of alternatives and where decision criteria relate to soft goals, the decision problem is particularly hard to solve. This paper analyzes the use of artificial neural networks to improve the relevance of the ranking of alternatives delivered by MCDM problem-solving techniques. Afterwards, a model using a combination of artificial neural networks and of the weighted sum model, a particular MCDM problem-solving technique, is built to recommend smartphones.

N2  - Cloud adoption is an attractive technological innovation due to the capital cost reduction and fast quality improvements it provides. In this paper, we present a new fuzzy methodology for cloud service selection. Product features and functionalities, customer support, customer rating, and security options are just a few of the factors influencing cloud platforms evaluation. A practical example for ordering cloud storage systems is calculated by using fuzzy measurement of alternatives and ranking according to the compromise solution (MARCOS) method. After establishing the relevant indicators for cloud technologies' assessment and their relative weights, crisp values and linguistic terms are transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers and then multi-criteria analysis is employed. The obtained ranking helps managers make an informed and wellgrounded decision for cloud platform selection.

N2  - Uncertainty is one of the main concerns in geospatial data analysis. It affects different parts of decision making based on such data. In this paper, a new methodology to handle uncertainty for multi-criteria decision making problems is proposed. It integrates hierarchical rough granulation and rule extraction to build an accurate classifier. Rough granulation provides information granules with a detailed quality assessment. The granules are the basis for the rule extraction in granular computing, which applies quality measures on the rules to obtain the best set of classification rules. The proposed methodology is applied to assess seismic physical vulnerability in Tehran. Six effective criteria reflecting building age, height and material, topographic slope and earthquake intensity of the North Tehran fault have been tested. The criteria were discretized and the data set was granulated using a hierarchical rough method, where the best describing granules are determined according to the quality measures. The granules are fed into the granular computing algorithm resulting in classification rules that provide the highest prediction quality. This detailed uncertainty management resulted in 84% accuracy in prediction in a training data set. It was applied next to the whole study area to obtain the seismic vulnerability map of Tehran. A sensitivity analysis proved that earthquake intensity is the most effective criterion in the seismic vulnerability assessment of Tehran.

N2  - Clustering is one of the most important tasks in exploratory data analysis. One of the simplest and the most widely used clustering algorithm is K-means which was proposed in 1955. K-means algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. This is evidenced by hundreds of publications over the last 50 years that extend k-means in various ways. Unfortunately, because of its nature, this algorithm is very sensitive to the initial placement of the cluster centres. In order to address this problem, many initialisation methods (IMs) have been proposed. In this thesis, we first provide a historical overview of these methods. Then we present two new non-random initialisation methods for k-means algorithm. Finally, we analyse the experimental results using real datasets and then the performance of IMs is evaluated by TOPSIS multi-criteria decision-making method. Finally, we prove that not only famous k-means IMs often have poor performance but also there are in fact strong alternative approaches.

N2  - The uncertainty in the water-based renewable energy systems reduces the plant capacity. However, real-time monitoring of hydropower plants ensures optimality and continuous faultless performance from the plant. But the implementation of real-time systems has always increased the overall operation cost of the power plant due to the continuous monitoring, analysis and decision-making (MAD) to assure prolonged and in situ detection and solution of uncertainties. The requirement to observe multiple indicators which represent the plant performance, elevate the cost of managing and impact the economical returns from the power plant. Also the infrastructural adjustments required to enable real-time monitoring of a power plant will also induce increased expenditure. The present study aimed to reduce the cost and infrastructural requirements of a smart system to represent the plant performance for instant mitigation of system failures by replacing the requirement of multi-indicator tracking by single weighted function monitoring. This monitoring upgradation will reduce the process cost of the system, thereby elevating the profitability of the power plant. The functional tracking will also increase the efficiency of the MAD and minimize the memory requirement of the real-time monitoring as single pointer will be required to be analysed and evaluated before taking a decision. In this aspect, an objective multi-criteria decision-making technique was used to find the significance of each indicator in hydropower production such that they can be tracked as per their potential for destabilizing the system. The results show that the new multi-criteria decision-making method which hybridizes with polynomial neural networks can identify uncertainty based on the significance of parameters by a portable and independent platform that can be integrated with supervisory control-based systems to monitor uncertainty in a hydropower system. According to the results, operation and maintenance cost followed by the discharge indicator was found to have the highest significance among the indicators considered in the study. The results depict that the new multi-criteria decision-making method with polynomial neural networks can identify uncertainty based on the significance of parameters with the help of a portable and independent platform that can be integrated in supervisory control systems to monitor uncertainty in a hydropower system at real time.

N2  - The current review contributes with an extensive overview of decision support systems in diagnosing heart diseases in clinical settings. The investigators independently screened and abstracted studies related to heart diseases-based clinical decision support system (DSS) published until 8-June-2015 in PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane Library. The data extracted from the twenty full-text articles that met the inclusion criteria was classified under the following fields; heart diseases, methods for data sets formation, machine learning algorithms, machine learning-based DSS, comparator types, outcome evaluation and clinical implications of the reported DSS. Out of total of 331 studies 20 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies relate to ischemic heart diseases with neural network being the most common machine learning (ML) technique. Among the ML techniques, ANN classifies myocardial infarction with 97% and myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with 87.5% accuracy, CART classifies heart failure with 87.6%, neural network ensembles classifies heart valve with 97.4%, support vector machine classifies arrhythmia screening with 95.6%, logistic regression classifies acute coronary syndrome with 72%, artificial immune recognition system classifies coronary artery disease with 92.5% and genetic algorithms and multi-criteria decision analysis classifies chest-pain patients with 91% accuracy respectively. There were 55% studies that validated the results in clinical settings while 25% validated the results through experimental setups. Rest of the studies (20%) did not report the applicability and feasibility of their methods in clinical settings. The study categorizes the ML techniques according to their performance in diagnosing various heart diseases. It categorizes, compares and evaluates the comparator based on physician’s performance, gold standards, other ML techniques, different models of same ML technique and studies with no comparison. It also investigates the current, future and no clinical implications. In addition, trends of machine learning techniques and algorithms used in the diagnosis of heart diseases along with the identification of research gaps are reported in this study. The reported results suggest reliable interpretations and detailed graphical self-explanatory representations by DSS. The study reveals the need for establishment of non-ambiguous real-time clinical data for proper training of DSS before it can be used in clinical settings. The future research directions of the ML-based DSS is mostly directed towards development of generalized systems that can decide on clinical measurements which are easily accessible and assessable in real-time.

N2  - This paper proposes a hybrid method for online reviews analysis through multi-criteria decision-making, text mining and predictive learning techniques to find the relative importance of factors affecting travelers' decision-making in selecting green hotels with spa services. The proposed method is developed for the first time in the context of tourism and hospitality by this research, especially for customer segmentation in green hotels through customers' online reviews. We use Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for cluster analysis, Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) technique for analyzing textual reviews, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for ranking hotel features, and Neuro-Fuzzy technique to reveal the customer satisfaction levels. The impact of green hotels with spa and non-spa services on travelers' satisfaction is investigated for four travelling groups: Travelled solo, Travelled with family, Travelled as a couple and Travelled with friends. The proposed method is evaluated on the travelers' reviews on 152 hotels in Malaysia. The findings of this study provide an important method for travelers' decision-making for hotel selection through User-Generated Content (UGC) and help hotel managers to improve their service quality and marketing strategies.

N2  - Background: Health Transformation Plan (HTP) was occurred in 2014 to improve access and equity and reduce out of pocket payments in Iranian Health Care System. In this regard the aim of this study is evaluating and ranking the service provider's infrastructures among the country provinces as an indicator of equity before and after implementation of the HTP. Methods: This cross sectional study is conducted in 2017. The study population included 31 provinces of the country. Data related to 4 years from 2012 to 2016 were included from the data bases of Ministry of Health and Medical Education as well as the statistics yearbook of the country. The obtained results of multi-criteria decision-making methods were analyzed as well. SPSS18 and Excel2013 software were used for data analysis. Results: Based on the VIKOR method, in 2012, Mazandaran, Tehran and Fars provinces and in 2013, the provinces of Tehran, Fars and Isfahan ranked from first to third respectively. Similarly after HTP, in 2015, the provinces of Tehran, Khorasan Razavi and Fars and in 2016 the provinces of Tehran, Fars and Khorasan Razavi have ranked from first to third respectively. Paramedic, dentist, pharmacist, medical institutions and hospital bed had a significant difference before and after the implementation of Health Transformation Plan, so that the number of these indicators increased after implementation of the HTP (P value < 0.05). Conclusions: According to the results, there are many differences between the provinces and these disparities have not decreased significantly after HTP. Consequently, it is suggested to the health sector policy makers to make regional plans and allocate the budget of HTP, based on the status of the provinces. In addition, responding to these inequalities requires a transparent and systematic approach to provide the budget for allocating to the population, health needs, and the lack of development and geographical isolation of regions.

N2  - A new computational framework for systematic and optimal alloy design is introduced. It is based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm which allows (i) the screening of vast compositional ranges and (ii) the optimisation of the performance of novel alloys. Alloys performance is evaluated on the basis of their predicted constitutional and thermomechanical properties. To this end, the CALPHAD method is used for assessing equilibrium characteristics (such as constitution, stability or processability) while Gaussian processes provide an estimate of thermomechanical properties (such as tensile strength or creep resistance), based on a multi-variable non-linear regression of existing data. These three independently well-assessed tools were unified within a single C++ routine. The method was applied to the design of affordable nickel-base superalloys for service in power plants, providing numerous candidates with superior expected microstructural stability and strength. An overview of the metallurgy of optimised alloys, as well as two detailed examples of optimal alloys, suggest that improvements over current commercial alloys are achievable at lower costs.

N2  - In this contribution, the optimization of systems under uncertainty is considered. The possibilistic evaluation of the fuzzy-valued constraints and the adoption of a multicriteria decision making technique for the fuzzy-valued objective function enable a meaningful solution to general fuzzy-valued optimization problems. The presented approach is universally applicable, which is demonstrated by reformulating and solving the linear quadratic regulator problem for fuzzy-valued system matrices and initial conditions.

N2  - The world is rapidly urbanized in the recent decades and urban areas are dealing with enormous changes and demands in utilizing the land units. To prevent incongruous land development, a seamless land use control planning tool, impowered by a decision support system is an imperative part of development management. This study focuses on evaluating the suitability of existing land uses through a spatial decision support system. Although the problem involves various criteria as well as expert judgments, we dealt with a multi-criteria group decision making problem. The proposed methodology consists of two main sections: density-based induced ordered weighted averaging (D-IOWA) operator as a group decision making section to combine expert opinions on the problem, and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy resonance system (ANFIS) to define the compatibility of the land uses in their surrounding environment. Expert opinions were aggregated by the D-IOWA operator and the ANFIS model was trained and then applied to the rest of the data to generate the compatibility map of the residential areas. An accuracy of 81%, and a root mean square error of 0.44 were observed. Maximum 15% variation in the outputs was observed in the sensitivity analysis. In addition to the performance measurements of the model, some other models were implemented and compared with the ANFIS model. The comparisons concluded that most of the models provided acceptable accuracies while the ANFIS model acquired the best results and confirmed to be used in similar circumstances. This study confirmed that a multi-criteria decision-making system supported by an accurate classification system can provide a basis for a detailed and accurate distribution of land use across the land unit.

N2  - Very complex micro-architectures, like complex superscalar/SMT or multicore systems, have lots of configurations. Exploring this huge design space and trying to optimize multiple objectives, like performance, power consumption and hardware complexity is a real challenge. In this paper, using the multi-objective design space exploration tool FADSE, we tried to optimize the hardware parameters of the complex superscalar Grid ALU Processor. We compared how different heuristic algorithms handle the DSE optimization. Three of these algorithms are taken from the jMetal library (NSGAII, SPEA2 and SMPSO) while the other two, CNSGAII and MOHC were implemented by us. We show that in this huge design space the differences between the best found individuals by every algorithm are very small, only the time in which they got to these solutions differs. In order to accelerate the DSE process we also did a feature selection through machine learning techniques and ran all DSE algorithms again with a smaller number of input parameters. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - One of the matters which has influence on Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods is the normalizing procedure. Most MCDM methods implement normalization techniques to produce dimensionless data in order to aggregate/rank alternatives. Using different normalization techniques may lead to different rankings. So, selecting a more suitable normalization technique is a requirement in the decision process. Specially, by the advent of big data and its role in developing life’s quality, finding the best normalization technique in MCDM models are more challenging. Collecting data from sensors causes more complex decision problems, thus, providing accurate normalized values (in the same unit) is more critical in these types of contexts. In this research, we analyze and evaluate the effect of different normalization techniques on the ranking of alternatives in one of the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods called Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) using our developed assessment framework. An illustrative example (smart car parking) is used to discuss the suitability of the framework and recommend more proper normalization technique for AHP. Furthermore, the developing of technological innovation is expected by using the evaluation framework which can raise the accuracy of the normalized values in decision problems.

N2  - Steel ropes are complex flexible structures used in many technical applications, such as elevators, cable cars, and funicular cabs. Due to the specific design and critical safety requirements, diagnostics of ropes remains an important issue. Broken wire number in the steel ropes is limited by safety standards when they are used in the human lifting and carrying installations. There are some practical issues on loose wires-firstly, it shows end of lifetime of the entire rope, independently of wear, lubrication or wrong winding on the drums or through pulleys; and, secondly, it can stick in the tight pulley-support gaps and cause deterioration of rope structure up to birdcage formations. Normal rope operation should not generate broken wires, so increasing of their number shows a need for rope installation maintenance. This paper presents a methodology of steel rope diagnostics and the results of analysis using multi-criteria analysis methods. The experimental part of the research was performed using an original test bench to detect broken wires on the rope surface by its vibrations. Diagnostics was performed in the range of frequencies from 60 to 560 Hz with a pitch of 50 Hz. The obtained amplitudes of the broken rope wire vibrations, different from the entire rope surface vibration parameters, was the significant outcome. Later analysis of the obtained experimental results revealed the most significant values of the diagnostic parameters. The evaluation of the power of the diagnostics was implemented by using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. Various decision-making methods are necessary due to unknown efficiencies with respect to the physical phenomena of the evaluated processes. The significance of the methods was evaluated using objective methods from the structure of the presented data. Some of these methods were proposed by authors of this paper. Implementation of MCDM in diagnostic data analysis and definition of the diagnostic parameters significance offers meaningful results.

N2  - With increasing amount of data generated every day, there is a need to extract useful information from the data which is an important problem to be solved. Machine learning is a method that enables the computer system to have the intelligence by analyzing the data and building an automated analytical model. The algorithms in machine learning are broadly classified as either iterative or non-iterative algorithms. An optimization algorithm plays a key role in machine learning that is solved by iterative methods that are executed iteratively to generate optimum solution or till a satisfactory solution is obtained. A non-iterative algorithm is computationally faster than iterative algorithms as it does not require iteration or little iter ation to train the data. This paper makes an analysis of these iterative and non-iterative algorithms and performs comparison upon their respective advantages and drawbacks. These algorithms are compared based on various parameters such as time taken to build the model, correctly and wrongly classified instances, mean absolute error, root means square error, true positive, false positive, precision and recall are computed. Multi Criteria Decision Making method such as TOPSIS is used to improve the efficiency of the decision making process by suggesting best machine learning technique that improves classification.

N2  - A "Risk-based Tool for the Regional Ranking of Environmental Chemical Stressors" has been developed, aimed at supporting decision-makers in the identification of priority environmental contaminants, as well as priority areas, to be further assessed. The tool implements a methodology based on a quantitative Weight-of-Evidence approach, integrating three types of information, identified as "Lines-of-Evidence" (LoE), namely: LoE "Environmental Contamination" (including data on chemical contamination in environmental matrices in the region, thus providing information on potential population exposure), LoE "Intake" (including results from human biomonitoring studies, i.e. concentration of chemicals in human biological matrices, thus providing an integrated estimation of exposure) and LoE "Observed Effects" (including information on the incidence of adverse health outcomes associated with environmental exposure to chemicals).A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodology based on fuzzy logic has been developed to support the integration of information related to these three LoEs for each chemical stressor. The tool allows one to rank chemical stressors at different spatial scales, such as at the regional level as well as within each sub-area (e.g., counties). Moreover, it supports the identification of priority sub-areas within the region, where environmental and health data suggest possible adverse health effects and thus more investigation efforts are needed. To evaluate the performance of this newly developed tool, a case-study in the Flemish region (north of Belgium) has been selected. In the case-study, data on soil contamination by metals and organic contaminants were integrated with data on exposure and effect biomarkers measured in adolescents within the framework of the human biomonitoring study performed by the Flemish Centre of Expertise on Environment and Health in the period 2002-2006. The case-study demonstrated the performance of the tool in integrating qualitative and quantitative data with expert judgement for the identification of priority contaminants and areas. The proposed approach proved to be flexible, allowing for the incorporation of individual decision-maker's preferences, and, at the same time, to be transparent since all assumptions and value attributions are traceable. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Today's ecology is erected with miscellaneous framework. However, numerous sources deteriorate it, such as urban rivers that directly cause the environmental pollution. For chemical pollution abatement from urban water bodies, many techniques were introduced to rehabilitate the water quality of these water bodies. In this research, Bacterial Technology (BT) was applied to urban rivers escalating the necessity to control the water pollution in different places (Xuxi River (XXU); Gankeng River (GKS); Xia Zhang River (XZY); Fenghu and Song Yang Rivers (FSR); Jiu Haogang River (JHH)) in China. For data analysis, the physiochemical parameters such as temperature, chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP), and ammonia nitrogen (NH) were determined before and after the treatment. Multicriteria Decision Making (MCDM) method was used for relative significance of different water quality on each station, based on fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP). The overall results revealed that the pollution is exceeding at "JHH" due to the limit of "COD" as critical water quality parameter and after treatment, an abrupt recovery of the rivers compared with the average improved efficiency of nutrients was 79%, 74%, 68%, and 70% of COD, DO, TP, and NH, respectively. The color of the river's water changed to its original form and aquatic living organism appeared with clear effluents from them.

N2  - Deep learning improves the realistic expression of virtual simulations specifically to solve multi-criteria decision-making problems, which are generally rely on high-performance artificial intelligence. This study was inspired by the motivation theory and natural life observations. Recently, motivation-based control has been actively studied for realistic expression, but it presents various problems. For instance, it is hard to define the relation among multiple motivations and to select goals based on multiple motivations. Behaviors should generally be practiced to take into account motivations and goals. This paper proposes a deep Q-network (DQN)-based multi-criteria decision-making framework for virtual agents in real time to automatically select goals based on motivations in virtual simulation environments and to plan relevant behaviors to achieve those goals. All motivations are classified according to the five-level Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, and the virtual agents train a double DQN by big social data, select optimal goals depending on motivations, and perform behaviors relying on a predefined hierarchical task networks (HTNs). Compared to the state-of-the-art method, the proposed framework is efficient and reduced the average loss from 0.1239 to 0.0491 and increased accuracy from 63.24 to 80.15%. For behavioral performance using predefined HTNs, the number of methods has increased from 35 in the Q network to 1511 in the proposed framework, and the computation time of 10,000 behavior plans reduced from 0.118 to 0.1079 s.

N2  - In recent years, environmental awareness has increased considerably, and in order to decrease endangerments such as air and water pollution, and also global warming, green procurement should be employed. Therefore, in the assessment of suppliers, their environmental performance should be taken into consideration along with other criteria for supplier selection. Raising awareness of sustainability in production and conservation and protection of the environment is very important both for the whole environment and for the company itself by increasing its competitive advantage. And, one of the steps to achieve this is for the companies to try to select green suppliers. So, the purpose of this study is to raise awareness and tackle the need for green supplier selection and, using multiple-criteria decision-making models, to elaborate a case study regarding this. A survey was conducted in a manufacturing firm. The data were analysed, and fuzzy MCDM (multicriteria decision-making) methods and artificial neural networks were implemented. Fuzzy methods are the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy AHP), fuzzy TOPSIS, and fuzzy ELECTRE. ANN supports the result of fuzzy MCDM models from the profit side. ANN can make the best estimate of the current year based on historical data. Fuzzy MCDM methods will also find good solutions using the available data but will produce different solutions as there are different decision-making methods. It is aimed to produce a synergy from the solutions obtained here and to produce a better solution. Instead of a single method, it would be more accurate to produce a better solution than the solution provided by all of them. The dominant result has been obtained using the committee fuzzy MCDM and ANN to select the best green supplier.

N2  - Nowadays, big volumes of User-Generated Content (UGC) spread across various kinds of social media. In microblogging, UCG can be generated in the form of ‘newsworthy’ posts, i.e., related to information that has a public utility for the people. In this context, being the UGC diffused without almost any traditional form of trusted external control, the possibility of incurring in possible fake news is far from remote. For this reason, several approaches for fake news detection in microblogging have been proposed up to now, mostly based on machine learning techniques. In this paper, an ongoing work based on the use of the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) paradigm to detect fake news is proposed. The aim is to reduce data dependency in building the model, and to have flexible control over the choices behind the fake news detection process.

N2  - The growing worldwide population has increased the need for technologies, computerised software algorithms and smart devices that can monitor and assist patients anytime and anywhere and thus enable them to lead independent lives. The real-time remote monitoring of patients is an important issue in telemedicine. In the provision of healthcare services, patient prioritisation poses a significant challenge because of the complex decision-making process it involves when patients are considered ‘big data’. To our knowledge, no study has highlighted the link between ‘big data’ characteristics and real-time remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation process, as well as the inherent challenges involved. Thus, we present comprehensive insights into the elements of big data characteristics according to the six ‘Vs’: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value and variability. Each of these elements is presented and connected to a related part in the study of the connection between patient prioritisation and real-time remote healthcare monitoring systems. Then, we determine the weak points and recommend solutions as potential future work. This study makes the following contributions. (1) The link between big data characteristics and real-time remote healthcare monitoring in the patient prioritisation process is described. (2) The open issues and challenges for big data used in the patient prioritisation process are emphasised. (3) As a recommended solution, decision making using multiple criteria, such as vital signs and chief complaints, is utilised to prioritise the big data of patients with chronic diseases on the basis of the most urgent cases.

N2  - Operators of North America's potable water systems are facing numerous
challenges in meeting the current needs and future expectations. Even
though utility management experts started building customer-driven asset
management systems to prioritize the water mains' maintenance and
replacement, the gap between the utility experts' and end users'
perspectives still exists due to the lack of technical knowledge in
terms of assessing the water quality. Therefore, this paper proposes a
service-based asset management framework that evaluates the factors
associated with the level of service (LOS) of the water supply networks
and maps it to the physical condition. In this paper, the LOS for water
supply networks is an indicator that measures the ability of a
municipality to continuously supply the end users with adequate water
quality to ensure fewer customer complaints and higher end-user
satisfaction. The framework revolves around three phases: (1) data
collection; (2) model implementation, which comprises LOS assessment and
LOS and condition mapping models; and (3) results and analysis. To
assess the LOS, a questionnaire was designed and analyzed using the
best-worst method. Furthermore, an artificial neural network model was
developed to map the relationship between the LOS and condition. Water
quality, customer complaints, pressure, and continuity of water supply
were used as mapping metrics between the LOS and condition. Toward the
end, the framework was applied to the water distribution network of
Montreal, Canada and it showed promising results in estimating the
corresponding LOS from the condition. In addition, a cross-validation
was carried out and the results displayed an 0.871 coefficient of
determination (R2), which implies a strong existing relationship between
the model inputs and outputs. This framework enables the utility experts
to understand the customer perception of the service, optimize the

N2  - Determining the number of clusters in a data set is an essential yet difficult step in cluster analysis. Since this task involves more than one criterion, it can be modeled as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. This paper proposes a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM)-based approach to estimate the number of clusters for a given data set. In this approach, MCDM methods consider different numbers of clusters as alternatives and the outputs of any clustering algorithm on validity measures as criteria. The proposed method is examined by an experimental study using three MCDM methods, the well-known clustering algorithm-k-means, ten relative measures, and fifteen public-domain UCI machine learning data sets. The results show that MCDM methods work fairly well in estimating the number of clusters in the data and outperform the ten relative measures considered in the study. © 2012 Peng et al.

N2  - In this article, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are used for multi-objective Pareto optimal design of Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)-type neural networks that have been deployed for fatigue life modeling of unidirectional GRP composites using some input-output experimental data. Multi-objective EAs (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, NSGA-II) with a diversity preserving mechanism are used for Pareto optimization of such GMDH-type neural networks. The important conflicting objectives of GMDH-type neural networks that are considered in this work are, namely, Training Error (TE), Prediction Error (PE) and number of neurons (N) of such neural network. Different pairs of these objective functions are selected for 2-objective optimization processes. Therefore, optimal Pareto fronts of such models are obtained in each case which exhibit the trade-off between the corresponding pair of conflicting objectives and thus provide different non-dominated optimal choices of GMDH-type neural networks models for fatigue life of unidirectional GRP composites. Moreover, all the three objectives are considered in a 3-objective optimization process which consequently lead to some more non-dominated choices of GMDHtype models representing the trade-off among the training error, prediction error, and number of neurons (complexity of network), simultaneously. The overlay graphs of these Pareto fronts also expose that the 3-objective results include those of the 2-objective results and also provide more optimal choices for the multi-objective design of GMDH-type neural networks in terms of minimum training error, minimum prediction error and minimum complexity.

N2  - In this work, a novel multi-objective design optimization procedure is presented for the Minkowski Reflectarray RA s using a complete 3-D CST Microwave Studio MWS-based Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network MLP NN model including the substrate constant er with a hybrid Genetic GA and Nelder-Mead NM algorithm. The MLP NN model provides an accurate and fast model and establishes the reflection phase of a unit Minkowski RA element as a continuous function within the input domain including the substrate 1≤εr≤6; 0.5 mm≤h≤3 mm in the frequency between 8 GHz≤f≤12 GHz. This design procedure enables a designer to obtain not only the most optimum Minkowski RA design all throughout the X- band, at the same time the optimum Minkowski RAs on the selected substrates. Moreover a design of a fully optimized X-band 15×15 Minkowski RA antenna is given as a worked example together with the tolerance analysis and its performance is also compared with those of the optimized RA s on the selected traditional substrates. Finally it may be concluded that the presented robust and systematic multi-objective design procedure is conveniently applied to the Microstrip Reflectarray RAs constructed from the advanced patches.

N2  - Influence maximization problem is the procedure of attempting to identify a group of K nodes in a social network in order to maximize the dissemination of influence under certain influence models. Based on state transition algorithm (STA) and a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) method called Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), a novel hybrid approach has been proposed to cope with the influence maximization problem in this paper. Firstly, an intelligent optimization paradigm called STA is introduced to obtain the most appropriate weights that are used to integrate the criteria of each alternative in the VIKOR method. Then, a hybrid normalization technique has been presented to allow the process of aggregating criterion with numerical and comparable data properly in this method. Several typical networks have been used to testify the effectiveness of proposed method and technique. Compared with other approaches, experimental results show that our approach can solve the influence maximization problem more effectively.

N2  - Usually, multi-criteria decision making methods are embedded with design of experiment (DOE) approach for handling the multi-response optimisation problems. However, uncertainties, impreciseness and arbitrary human judgement for weight assignment to criteria and alternatives result in inferior solutions. To overcome this limitation, an intelligent approach based on neuro-fuzzy system is proposed for converting multi-responses into single equivalent response. To illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach, a complex case study of taper cutting operation using wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) process is considered. The effect of process parameters on equivalent response has been studied in detail and the relationship between the input parameters and responses are established by means of a nonlinear regression analysis resulting in a valid mathematical model. Finally, optimal parameter setting is obtained by recently proposed meta-heuristics like bat algorithm.

N2  - This paper proposes a novel neural-MCDM-based routing protocol, called NMRouting, to transmit data packets in mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Data packets are transmitted through neighbouring nodes that have high success rates from among a list of available neighbours. A perceptron-based neural controller specifies a success rate for every neighbour based on remaining energy, occupied buffer, and mobility speed. A MCDM controller determines the number of paths based on packet priority rate, distance, and average mobility speed. An energy management model is suggested to conduct energy consumption of the nodes efficiently as well as three queue types - critical, reliability, and ordinary - are considered to guarantee network reliability. Besides, the paper presents UML diagrams to develop NMRouting in real applications. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol has a high performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, network lifetime, and network traffic, compared to DSR, AODV, DPG and QMRPRNS.

N2  - The direct metal deposition (DMD) process is one of the metal-based additive manufacturing techniques available today. In this study, an injection nozzle design methodology is proposed based on the finite element modeling of substrate temperature and powder distribution. The design methodology is applied to the deposition of Ti-6Al-4V powder in building thin-walled structures, which is also applicable to solid parts. The objective is to explore and find the designs of injection nozzle shape that maximize the powder usage and minimize laser energy needs, later defined as powder catchment and laser energy efficiencies. The laser heating of substrate model and the particle-laden gas flow model are utilized. First, a proper set of process parameters is chosen to model the melt pool shape on the substrate that can build a thin-walled structure of certain width. Then, the powder distribution is explored by testing various injection nozzle shape parameters based on the solutions of a particle-laden injection turbulent flow. A neural network is built in order to explore the variations of objective functions due to the design variables. The first output of the neural network predicts the particle concentration in flight. The second output evaluates the powder catchment efficiency. The process efficiency is defined as the product of the two outputs. After validating the neural network, multiple sets of injection nozzle geometric parameters are provided to map their process efficiencies. With the methodology proposed, the injection nozzle can be designed to maximize the process efficiency.

N2  - Large amount of unstructured information is much benefited for organizations if it could be analyzed and used especially to support decision-making process. It is impractical and time consuming for decision makers to manually process the ill-defined information since the standard tools available designed for structured data analysis. It motivates to devising an intelligent and automated tool to process this kind of information and make them recognizable for Decision Support Systems (DSS). This has addressed the need to have uniform knowledge representation in order to structure data into machine readable format for decision-making process. A framework of ontological-based for supporting multi criteria decision-making is proposed in this paper. Currently, the framework is under implementation as a research prototype. A case study is drawn from the Malaysian construction tender evaluation to demonstrate the applicability of our approach. © 2010 IEEE.

N2  - The in-service inspection planning process for topside piping equipment of aging oil and gas (O&G) production and process facilities (P&PFs) involves personnel with different kinds of expertise, experience, and knowledge as well as a vast amount of data and information. To simplify the inspection planning process and increase the quality of an inspection program, various industrial organizations as well as researchers have been developing numerous techniques in an isolated fashion to address the challenges pertaining to different activities involved in the inspection planning process. In order to mechanize the overall inspection process, suitable techniques need to be identified for the different activities carried out in a generic inspection planning process. This manuscript discusses the potential use of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDM) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. It also provides evidence about the suitability of AI techniques in relation to fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks for the mechanization of the inspection planning process in a dynamic manner. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2014.

N2  - This work presents a novel approach for decision-making for multi-objective binary classification problems. The purpose of the decision process is to select within a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, one model that minimizes the structural risk (generalization error). This new approach utilizes a kind of prior knowledge that, if available, allows the selection of a model that better represents the problem in question. Prior knowledge about the imprecisions of the collected data enables the identification of the region of equivalent solutions within the set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Results for binary classification problems with sets of synthetic and real data indicate equal or better performance in terms of decision efficiency compared to similar approaches.

N2  - The omnipresence of the cloud-based applications and the exponential growth of the cloud services at different dimensions make the selection of user requirement compliant and trustworthy cloud service provider, a challenging task. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approaches have their significance in solving cloud service selection problem since they evaluate the alternatives (cloud service providers) based on the intrinsic relationships among the criteria (QoS parameters). However, the assignment of appropriate weights to the criteria has a high impact on the accuracy of the service ranking and the performance of the MCDM methods. Hence, this paper presents a Wavelet Neural Network—Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (WNN-EDAS), a novel MCDM approach for the identification of suitable and trustworthy cloud service providers. WNN-EDAS employs WNN to calculate appropriate weights for each criterion and EDAS to rank the cloud service providers. The experiments were carried out on Cloud Armor, a real-world trust feedback dataset to demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and feasibility of WNN-EDAS over the state-of-the-art MCDM approaches in terms of sensitivity analysis and rank reversal.

N2  - This project combines surrogate modeling, a supervised machine learning technique, to bypass whole building energy simulations to enable multi-objective design optimization. We applied this method to identify Pareto optimal retrofit designs that are energy and cost effective for three residential apartments in Lisbon, Portugal. As part of our validation of this approach, we compared the surrogate model error for these Pareto optimal designs to the error in the rest of the design space when compared to a detailed energy simulation. Surrogate model error is higher towards the minimum and maximum energy consumption within the Pareto optimal designs compared to the rest of the design space. We also find that in the Pareto optimal set some design variable values are near their minimum or maximum value, which could be driving higher surrogate model error. We propose that future research should retrain the surrogate model after identifying design variable values of interest from an initial optimization run.

N2  - In this paper, a hierarchical decision making framework based on multi-criteria decision making approach is presented to prioritize the wind energy production farms located in Mediterranean sea region of Turkey. Some criteria such as economic, technical, and environmental are considered for the evaluation model. In addition, an artificial neural network (ANN) model based on back propagation neural network (BPN) is also used to assess the alternative sites for wind energy generation. A comparison between proposed approaches is made to select the most appropriate wind energy production farm. It is found that the results obtained from ANN model and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) approach are similar. Moreover, Anamur district is the best area among the alternatives for establishing wind turbines in Mediterranean sea region of Turkey. The originality of the paper comes from the application of the proposed FAHP approach to the selection of the best wind energy production site and the comparison with ANN. © Sila Science.

N2  - Architecture selection is a fundamental problem in artificial neural networks, which could be treated as a decision making process that evaluates, ranks, and makes choices from a set of network structures. Traditional methods evaluate a network structure by designing a criterion based on a validation model or an error bound model. On one hand, the time complexity of a validation model is usually high; on the other hand, different validation models or error bound models may lead to different (even conflicting) results, which post challenges to the traditional single criterion-based architecture selection methods. In the area of decision making, many problems employed multiple criteria since the performance is better than using a single criterion. In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria decision making based architecture selection algorithm for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks trained by extreme learning machine. Two criteria are incorporated into the selection process, i.e., training accuracy and the Q-value estimated by the localized generalization error model. The training accuracy reflects the capability of the model on correctly categorizing the known samples, and the Q-value estimated by localized generalization error model reflects the size of the neighbourhood of training samples in which the model can predict unseen samples with confidence. By achieving a trade-off between these two criteria, a new architecture selection algorithm is proposed. Experimental comparisons demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

N2  - The construction industry is responsible for a large share of the global environmental impact. The need for addressing sustainability and increased competition calls for the development of innovative design methods that include sustainability in a transparent way. The aim of this work is to propose a framework to use machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) for structural design optimization based on sustainability and buildability criteria. AI opens up new possibilities to optimize and assess structures early in the planning and design stages. In that way, it is possible to decrease the negative and enhance the positive environmental, economic and social impacts and create a more time‐ and cost‐effective design process. The work is meant to serve as a first step toward the development of AI‐based methods in the construction industry, which can bring digitalization in the construction industry to a new level and create new services and business models.

N2  - The NN-DM is a method developed to find a mathematical model that represents the Decision-Maker (DM) by employing an artificial neural network (NN) in situations in which the preferences can be represented by a utility function. This paper presents further developments to the NN-DM method to find a model in a polymer extrusion process. The form of the DM’s interaction, the domain assignment, the ranking process, and the performance assessment are adapted to a real context of a multi-objective optimization problem followed by a design decision. The DM is then requested to fill a matrix expressing his preferences considering pairwise comparisons expressing ordinal relations only. Two multi-objective optimization problems are tested, each one with three estimates of different Pareto-optimal fronts. The adapted NN-DM method is able to provide a model which sorts the available solutions from the best to the worst according to the DM’s preferences.

N2  - This research paper proposes a new hybrid methodology for very short-term load forecasting of hourly or designed to predict load for 1 hour ahead. The proposed hybrid methodology is based on weather data especially for optimizing the operation of power generating electricity from thermal generation. This hybrid modelling is a combination of the Fuzzy-Multi-Objective Decision-Making and feed-forward-Neural Network method. The novelty of this hybrid model is taking into account the weather and meteorology data. The first hybrid model implements Fuzzy-Multi Objective Decision Making as an input data pre-processing technique before the feed-forward Neural Network model. The error statistical indicators of the Fuzzy-Multi Objective Decision Making-Feed Forward Neural Network) model for mean square error is the mean value error 0.001 and root mean square error is mean value error 0.2. Note that the highest root means square error was 4.43 MW and the mean square error was 837.8 MW during the sixteen periods.

N2  - The problem of landslides and prevention of catastrophes at the time of climate change is of crucial importance for the future and the human survival on the planet. Events related to the flooding that occurred in Bosnia and Herzegovina in year 2014, the emergence of new landslides as well as activation of registered landslides, lead for the need to incorporate an extensive set of knowledge in this area. The aim is to prevent future disasters both in the region and beyond by combining artificial intelligence (fuzzy logic and neural networks), GIS (Geographic Information System), Multicriteria Decision Making (MCDM) and the area of risk management. The overlap of these mentioned areas of knowledge provides a framework for solving problems with landslides and prevention of possible future natural disasters and disasters caused by floods and landslides. "Save a life, save a whole world" is the goal of this team and the desire to implement methods that can contribute to preventing future disasters. ANFIS model in combination with GIS and multicriteria decision-making can be applied to risk management. The test site, the paper used the potential of landslides and unstable terrain in Canton Sarajevo, Bosnia and Hercegovina. Results are presented in GIS.

N2  - The present study mainly aims to identify and rank the effective factors on the location of Pasargad Bank through using multi-criteria decision making techniques in Yasouj City. In other words, it has been tried to answer this question that which are the important criteria and sub-criteria for choosing the location of Pasargad Bank's branches? And what is the most appropriate place establish the branches in Yasouj City? In this study, 10 people from the experts of Pasargad Banke as well as 270 people from the customers who have deposit in this bank and they have used facilities were investigated. The required information was collected through two questionnaires for experts and customers. The reliability of these two questionnaires was estimated by using Cronbach's Alpha formula. Data analysis was performed through ArcGIS, expert choice softwares. The effective criteria and sub-criteria on the location of Pasargad bank were identified and ranked and the potential places for building the new branches were specified. Finally, with regarding the limitation of banks' budget we have chosen the suitable points from these potential points though using the mathematical model of maximum coverage. The results show that the number of 58 thousands demands of the studied region with maximum building of three branches in specified points in addition to one existed branch can be covered.

N2  - Graph theory that can be used to describe the relationships among several individuals has numerous applications in diverse fields such as modern sciences and technology, database theory, data mining, neural networks, expert systems, cluster analysis, control theory, and image capturing. As a generalization of fuzzy set (FS) and intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS), the concept of neutrosophic set is a more functional tool for handling indeterminate, inconsistent and uncertain information that exist in real life compared to FSs and IFSs. In this paper, we apply the graph theory to the single-valued neutrosophic sets and investigate a new kind of graph structure which is called single-valued neutrosophic graphs and is generalized the results concerning crisp graphs, fuzzy graphs and intuitionistic fuzzy graphs. Then we describe some of their theoretical properties, such as the Cartesian product, composition, union and join. By applying two different procedures to solve single-valued neutrosophic decision-making problems, a neutrosophic graph-based multicriteria decision-making model is developed to consider relationships among the multi-input arguments which cannot be handled well by means of the existing methods. Finally, two illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the applicability, feasibility, effectiveness and advantages of these two proposed approaches.

N2  - For many years, supplier selection as an important multi-criteria decision has attracted both the researchers and practitioners. During recent years, high incidence of natural disasters, terrorism attacks, labor strikes and other kinds of risks, also known as disruptions, indicates the vulnerability of procurement process to these unpredicted events. In this study, a new framework is introduced to select suppliers while considering the supply risks. In the proposed framework, an expert determines the reliabilities of procurement elements (i.e., production, transportation and communication) based on some proposed risk factors. Then, a trained Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network plays the role of the expert opinion for estimating the reliability scores. In addition to reliabilities, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to take into account the conventional selection criteria: price, delivery, quality and capacity. A set of Pareto-optimal suppliers is obtained from the combination of efficiencies and reliability scores. Finally, the decision maker chooses between the non-dominated suppliers. Obtained experiment results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2013 Growing Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Disparate natural and artificial systems are modelled as complex networks to understand their structural properties and dynamics of phenomena occurring on them. Identification of key components (nodes) of a complex network and ranking them has both theoretical and practical applications. The node ranking techniques are compared on three categories of criteria, namely, Differentiation, Accuracy and Computational Efficiency. Having multiple criteria for technique selection and a number of alternative ranking techniques available renders ranking technique selection in the domain of complex networks as Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. A number of MCDM methods are accessible in the literature, but no treatment is available for the selection of node ranking techniques based on systematic decision making. In this paper, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), followed by Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), are used in tandem to propose a framework that objectively compares and select node ranking techniques for complex networks. The working of the proposed framework is demonstrated with a dataset of complex networks.

N2  - Portfolio selection is a hot topic in the research of smart Finance and Economics. In order to select the preferred stocks in a Portfolio, real-word decisions need to make to solve problems involve conflicting systems of criteria, uncertainty and imprecise information, especially those involve a group of decision makers (DMs) where a reduction of different individual preferences on a given set to a single collective preference, we consider a hybrid fuzzy Electre I approach for group decision-making under a fuzzy environment. The Electre method and its derivatives are prominent outranking approaches in Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), which is a widely used decision methodology that can improve the quality of group multiple criteria decisions by making the processes more explicit, rational and efficient. In this study, an alternative fuzzy outranking approach based on Electre I is proposed to consider the imprecise, uncertain, and linguistic assessments provided by a group of DMs. In this approach, the Electre I method is extended to take into account the uncertain, imprecise and linguistic assessments, besides, an outranking relation is defined by pairwise comparisons and the use of decision graphs to determine which action is preferable, incomparable or indifferent in the fuzzy environment. Feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated using a numerical example.

N2  - Originally developed in Japan in the late 1960s and based on the concepts of quality control and value engineering, quality function deployment (QFD) has been considered a useful tool for product development. It can effectively translate customer requirements into appropriate engineering characteristics for each stage of product development and production such as planning, product design, production process development and manufacture. This paper aims to provide a more balanced review of QFD that exhibits enough depth to be useful to researchers as well as enough breadth to cater for amateur readers. The focus is on materials published between 2005 and 2009. Previous reviews on QFD are commented and followed by reviews on recent developments of new methodologies, technical improvements and integration of QFD with other tools. The reviewed methodologies include fuzzy set theory, multicriteria decision analysis model, artificial neural network and hybrid approaches. Resource allocation, Kano's model, failure mode and effects analysis, robust design and an assortment of other recently developed tools are reviewed and evaluated in the context of their integration with QFD in an effort to improve the effectiveness and applicability of QFD in product design.

N2  - Providing machine learning capabilities on low cost electronic devices is a challenging goal especially in the context of the Internet of Things paradigm. In order to deliver high performance machine intelligence on low power devices, suitable hardware accelerators have to be introduced. In this paper, we developed a method enabling to evolve a hardware implementation together with a corresponding software controller for key components of smart embedded systems. The proposed approach is based on a multi-objective design space exploration conducted by means of extended linear genetic programming. The approach was evaluated in the task of approximate sigmoid function design which is an important component of hardware implementations of neural networks. During these experiments, we automatically re-discovered some approximate sigmoid functions known from the literature. The method was implemented as an extension of an existing platform supporting concurrent evolution of hardware and software of embedded systems.

N2  - Aerial target threat assessment is an important but stressful task carried out by operators. The work involves determining the threat of aerial targets based on various types of information about the target, such as kinematics, specifications, intelligence reports, and others. The success of threat assessment lies in the reliable fusion of this information. The recent progress in technology allows for the development of more complex decision making methodologies to take into account all types of information, latency, environments, changes in priority, and inconsistencies in the quality and availability of data sources. It also allows for the integration between different decision making methodologies in order to take advantage of the strengths of each independent methodology for different applications. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods provide a structured and intuitive framework for incorporating all available target information to evaluate the target threat. However, threat assessment is a complex process where there is not one MCDM method that works in all situations. The objective of this work is to develop a robust system that uses various MCDM methods as an ensemble (i.e. an EMCDM technique) and machine learning techniques to assess the threat of aerial targets. Experiments involving threat assessment on simulated targets indicate the benefit of using EMCDM techniques instead of using individual MCDM methods for performing high-level information fusion to assign threat values.

N2  - A mixed numerical-experimental approach capable to predict and optimize the performance of the footwear adhesive joints, based on the weight composition of used raw materials was presented. The approach based on the optimal design of adhesive composition to achieve the targets of minimum creep rate (CR) and maximum peel strength (PS) under manufacturing. Two stages are considered in the proposed approach. In the first stage, an approximation model is built based on planned experimental measurements and artificial neural network (ANN) developments. The ANN learning procedure uses a genetic algorithm. In the second stage an optimal design procedure is developed based on multi-objective design optimization (MDO) concepts. The MDO algorithm based on dominance concepts and evolutionary search is proposed aiming to build the optimal Pareto front. The model uses the optimal ANN to evaluate the fitness functions of the optimization problem. Furthermore, a ANN-based Monte Carlo simulation procedure is implemented and the sensitivity of the CR and PS relatively to weight compositions of raw materials is determined. The approach shown robustness to establish the trade-off between minimum CR properties and minimum inverse PS (maximum PS) using the weight composition of used raw materials. The optimal results for both CR and PS based on proposed approach are reached when large quantities for polyurethanes (Pus) and for some additives are considered. The performances of adhesive joints measured by CR and PS are very sensitive to the influence of some PUs and in some way are moderately sensitive to additives. The proposed MDO approach supported by experimental tests shows improved explorative properties of raw materials and can be a powerfully tool for the designers of adhesive joints in footwear industry.

N2  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to enable environmental sustainability and productivity performance assessment for integrated process and operation plans at the machine cell level of a manufacturing system. This approach determines optimal process and operation plans from a range of possible alternatives that satisfy the objectives and constraints. The methodology provides a systematic procedure to highlight parameters that have significant impact on both sustainability and productivity performance metrics. We developed models and applied them to analyze manufacturing life cycle scenarios for collecting and categorizing key concepts towards building a material information model for sustainability. Integration of process and operation plans allows globalized assessment of sustainability and productivity, while development of a multi-criteria decision-making method leads to optimization of process planning activities based on the impact of conflicting sustainability and productivity metrics. A case study is detailed to demonstrate the sustainability-focused methodology, wherein integrated simulation and optimization techniques are used to support analysis of candidate scenarios and selection of preferred alternatives from a finite set of alternate process and operation plans. A discrete event simulation tool is used to model evolution of sustainability metrics (e.g., energy consumption) and productivity metrics (e.g., production time, cost) of a shop floor. The outcomes of this work include determination of optimized feature sequence plans which optimize various key performance indicators depending on stakeholder interest based on time, sustainability and production cost.

N2  - It is well known that sufficiently long and continuous streamflow data are required for accurate estimations and informed decisions in water-resources planning, design, and management. Although streamflow data are measured and available at most river basins, streamflow records often suffer from insufficient length or missing data. In this work, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are applied to extend daily streamflow records at Lilin station located in Gaoping River basin, southern Taiwan. Two ANNs, including feed forward back propagation (FFBP) and radial basis function (RBF) networks, associated with various time-lagged streamflow and rainfall inputs of nearby long-record stations are employed to extend short daily streamflow records. Performances of ANNs are evaluated by root-mean-square error (RMSE), coefficient of efficiency (CE), and histogram-matching dissimilarity (HMD). Inconsistency among these evaluation measures is solved by the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), a widely used multi-criteria decision-making approach, to find an optimal model. The results indicate that RBF-E1 (entire-year data training with Qt and Qt−1 inputs) has the minimum RMSE of 104.4 m3/s, second highest CE of 0.956, and third lowest HMD of 0.0096, which outperforms other ANNs and provide the most accurate reconstruction of daily streamflow records at Lilin station.

N2  - The dynamic and uncertain demand forces organizations to provide flexible services in order to fulfill customer demands. Freight transportation, being the key component of the businesses, requires adoption of efficient Information and Communication Technologies which can induce transparent and flexible services. Blockchain Technology (BT) is an emerging technology which has great potential to cater solutions to freight transportation issues. This study identifies different critical success factors of BT adoption in freight transportation. An integrated Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) is applied to prioritize identified success factors. Further, modified Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (mTISM) is used to represent the interrelationship among different sub-factors. The findings of the study revealed Development Aspects, Customer Services and Technological Aspects as well as Data Transparency, Reliability and Organizational Culture as the most significant factors and sub-factors, respectively. The proposed model will guide freight transport managers to formulate their strategies regarding BT adoption.

N2  - Skyline operation is significantly important for Decision Support Systems (DSS) due to its ability to find a number of decision-maker (DM)-interested objects. However, an inherent weakness of conventional skyline queries is that the output size is hard to control by DMs. It actually includes two aspects. On one hand, the number of the returned skyline set might be too large to make the output meaningful. On the other hand, the skyline may not be informative enough or too concise to fulfill the DM's interests. Current solutions for the first aspect aim to refine the computed skyline and find a representative skyline subset with a feasible size. But the second aspect still remains open. In order to tackle this problem, this paper attempts to extend conventional skyline and thus proposes a novel Tolerant Skyline Operation. We study algorithms for computing this novel tolerant skyline. The final experiments employ both real datasets and synthetic datasets for illustration of our approaches. The results indicate that the tolerant skyline is more effective and practical. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Coronary stents are the preferred option for treating diseased coronary arteries. When implanted, the stent is deployed at the lesion to restore the lumen area by scaffolding the vessel open. However, stents still have a relatively high failure rate of 2–8%, with many patients requiring further interventions due to restenosis and stent thrombosis. It is known that blood flow disruption caused by the presence of a stent can trigger signalling pathways that accelerate restenosis or trigger thrombus formation. This work aims to find design variable values that minimize these adverse flow conditions using Multi-Objective optimisation.

N2  - Access to and investment in renewable energy are considered as essential factors in sustainable development. Recently, renewable energy sources and assessing their investment risk have attracted much attention, especially for companies willing to invest in the Belt and Road Initiative countries. As the main objective of the present research, investment risk factors of renewable energies in these countries are identified and categorized into five groups as economic, technical, environmental, social, and political using TODIM (Portuguese acronym for Interactive Multi-Criteria Decision Making) method. Then, the identified factors are weighted by the fuzzy-analytic network process (F-ANP) and different renewable energy sources are ranked by COPRAS, MABAC, and GRA methods under uncertainty conditions. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of investment decision making was carried out with the emphasis being placed on the tradability aspect of renewable energy projects. The results show that wind energy has a lower investment risk besides the higher economic justification, followed by hydropower. The results of this research are useful for policymakers, investors, and companies working in the field of renewable energies to assist them in the assessment of their investment projects and the expansion of their international markets.

N2  - The oil & gas industry is catching up to automation of traditional workflows practiced in the industry and implementation of artificial intelligence to fasten repetitive tasks. This is driven by the need to automate low-cognitive tasks enabling engineers to spend more time on high-cognitive components of the existing workflows, thus leading up to smarter decisions. This has been made possible by the recent developments and adoption of various analytics and machine learning tools. Well intervention and workover are a routine and important exercise undertaken in the oil and gas industry where the objective is to identify the sick wells and diagnose the right intervention and workover to improve the production. A typical well intervention and workover candidates study includes: 1. Identifying the underperforming wells, 2. Diagnosing these wells and identifying the right workover/ intervention opportunities 3. Creating a ranking of the opportunities using a standard approach. 4. Forecasting the gain after workover/intervention 5. Running economic analysis to identify the candidate based on opportunity's profitability Ujung Pangkah Oil and Gas Field is an offshore field located in Indonesia. The reservoir is a multilayered carbonate oil and gas reservoir, being produced mostly through horizontal wells. An intelligent solution termed as SWORDS was developed for the Ujung Pangkah field that enables the engineers to be permanently aware of the intervention and workover opportunities. The SWORDS solution is driven by 'Automation & Analytics', where the ranking of the opportunities has been driven by a multi-criteria decision making process leveraging the Petroleum Engineering techniques practiced over decades.

N2  - Top-k dominating queries, which return the k best items with a comprehensive “goodness” criterion based on dominance, have attracted considerable attention recently due to its important role in many data mining applications including multi-criteria decision making. In the Big Data era, the modes of data storage and processing are becoming distributed, and data is incomplete commonly in some real applications. The related existing researches focus on centralized datasets, or on complete data in distributed environments, and do not involve incomplete data in distributed environments. In this work, we present the first study for processing top-k dominating queries on incomplete data in distributed environments. We show that, through detailed analysis, even though the dominance relation on incomplete data objects is non-transitive in general, the transitive dominance relation holds for some incomplete data objects with different bitmaps. We then propose an novel algorithm TKDI-MR based on MapReduce for processing TKD queries on incomplete data in distributed environments utilizing the aforementioned property. Extensive experiments with both real-world and large-scale synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach is able to achieve good efficiency and stability.

N2  - This paper presents a novel design optimization procedure for an ultra large diameter permanent magnet generator. As the machine features unorthodox electromagnetic and mechanical layouts, basic principles for determining structural loads together with material quantities for cost estimation are described. Finite element modelling with beam elements is used for retrieving stresses and deformations of the novel carrier structure. Mathematical system response model of the generator is created with artificial neural networks, while genetic algorithm with gradient method is utilized for determining the optimal solutions. Input dataset for the model build-up is constructed with a help of a full factorial experimental method. Achieved results are utilized for describing the relationship between the structural response and efficiency values of the generator. As the design of the machine has to fulfil contradicting technical and economical requirements, Pareto optimality concept is employed. As an example, a set of optimal solutions is determined for the particular case.

N2  - With the increasing use of cloud computing, it is very important for the Cloud users to analyze and compare performance of the Cloud services. Since Cloud services selection problem contains several conflicting criteria, it is considered as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. On another side, one of the most popular unsupervised data mining methods is Clustering which is used for grouping set of objects. The contribution of this paper is to propose an approach based on clustering, Pareto Optimal and MCDM methods. Our approach allows users to specify the quality requirements of the cloud services they want to use. It consists of three steps: in the first step, we use the clustering, more precisely the artificial neural network, to minimize the very large number of cloud services on the Net. In the second step, we apply Pareto Optimal algorithm to select non-dominated services. Finally, in the third step, we use the weights provided by the user to select the most appropriate cloud service for these requirements. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study is presented.

N2  - In this work, the principles of multi-criteria decision-making were used to develop an efficient optimization strategy in gradient elution ion chromatographic analysis. Two different artificial neural network retention models (multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function), three different separation criterion functions (chromatography response function, separation factor product and normalized retention difference product), and four different robustness criterion functions (CR1-CR4) were examined. The shape of the calculated separation vs the robustness response surface was used as principal criterion. Analysis time and minimum separation of adjacent peaks were additional criteria. The results showed that the radial basis artificial neural network retention model in combination with normalized retention difference product separation criterion function and CR3 robustness criterion function provided the optimal gradient ion chromatographic analysis. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Extracting interesting tuples from a large database is an important problemin multi-criteria decision making. Two representative queries were proposed in the literature: top-k queries and skyline queries. A top-k query requires users to specify their utility functions beforehand and then returns k tuples to the users. A skyline query does not require any utility function from users but it puts no control on the number of tuples returned to users. Recently, a k-regret query was proposed and received attention from the community because it does not require any utility function from users and the output size is controllable, and thus it avoids those defficiencies of top-k queries and skyline queries. Specifically, it returns k tuples that minimize a criterion called the maximum regret ratio. In this paper, we present the lower bound of the maximum regret ratio for the k-regret query. Besides, we propose a novel algorithm, called Sphere, whose upper bound on the maximum regret ratio is asymptotically optimal and restriction-free for any dimensionality, the best-known result in the literature.We conducted extensive experiments to show that Sphere performs better than the state-of-the-art methods for the k-regret query.

N2  - Background: Nowadays, the health work decision makers need to analyze a huge amount of data and consider many conflicting evaluation criteria and sub-criteria. Therefore, an ergonomic evaluation in the work environment in order to the control occupational disorders is considered as the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. In this study, the ergonomic risks factors, which may influence health, were evaluated in a manufacturing company in 2014. Then entropy method was applied to prioritize the different risk factors. Methods: This study was done with a descriptive-analytical approach and 13 tasks were included from total number of employees who were working in the seven halls of an ark opal manufacturing (240). Required information was gathered by the demographic questionnaire and Assessment of Repetitive Tasks (ART) method for repetitive task assessment. In addition, entropy was used to prioritize the risk factors based on the ergonomic control needs. Results: The total exposure score based on the ART method calculated was equal to 30.07±12.43. Data analysis illustrated that 179 cases (74.6% of tasks) were in the high level of risk area and 13.8% were in the medium level of risk. ART- entropy results revealed that based on the weighted factors, higher value belongs to grip factor and the lowest value was related to neck and hand posture and duration. Conclusions: Based on the limited financial resources, it seems that MCDM in many challenging situations such as control procedures and priority approaches could be used successfully. Other MCDM methods for evaluating and prioritizing the ergonomic problems are recommended.

N2  - As cloud storage adopts a distributed architecture to store massive data, how to improve the reliability of the storage center has become the focus of researchers. HDFS, the distributed file system of Hadoop, uses a sequential recovery method to recover failed replicas when the node is down, which does not take into account the priority of the replicas and the load difference between each node, resulting in request blocking and system load imbalance. Aiming at this problem, we propose a replica recovery method based on access frequency and network environment awareness, use a priority-based recovery algorithm and multi-objective decision algorithm to guarantee the response speed and realize the cluster load balance. We set up a simulation environment for verification and compared the performance of our method with various algorithms in throughput and response time. The simulation results showed that our approach effectively solved the load imbalance problem on the premise of ensuring faster response time.

N2  - © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers. Finding the precise value of pixel-scale evapotranspiration (ET) for an entire basin is a major challenge to hydrologists. Many efforts have been made to conquer this challenge, among which remote sensing methods are the most promising ones. The surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) is one of the several established remote sensing methods to estimate ET. The anchor pixel selection process (e.g., hot and cold pixels) is one of the critical steps in the SEBAL model that also determines the accuracy of the model outputs. Several researchers have improved anchor pixel selection by an automated fashion. In the current study, a new simple method has been proposed to seek the best anchor pixels. Then, the daily ET outputs were assessed using observed data from the Eddy covariance (EC) tower data at Santa Cruz River Watershed for 2014-2015. The results showed that the daily ET with measured data at the study site confirmed our automated anchor pixel selection method to be reliable in terms of selecting appropriate hot and cold pixels under dry conditions by producing ET maps with reasonable accuracies (R2=0.78 and RMSE=0.46 mm day-1). Our study suggests that considerations of simple image-derived parameters, such as temperature difference between hot and cold pixels, distance from a representative station, and elevation differences could improve the automatic selection of anchor pixels and the implementation of the SEBAL model under dry conditions. The machine learning technique could be combined with the proposed automated algorithm to map ET in different climates (not only arid and semiarid) faster and with more accuracy.

N2  - A multi-criteria decision-making approach was used for the selection of GCMs for Nigeria based on their ability to replicate historical rainfall estimated using three entropy-based feature selection methods namely, Entropy Gain (EG), Gain Ratio (GR), and Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU). Performances of four bias correction methods were compared to identify the most suitable method for downscaling and projection of rainfall using the selected GCMs. Random forest (RF) regression was used for the generation of the multi-model ensemble (MME) average of projected rainfall. The ensemble projections for each of the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 were computed and compared with global precipitation climatology centre (GPCC) historical rainfall of Nigeria to assess the percentage changes in annual rainfall with 95% level of confidence at different ecological zones for three future periods 2010–2039, 2040–2069, and 2070–2099. Quantile regression was used to assess the changes in seasonal rainfall at 95% confidence interval over the present century. The results revealed that MRI-CGCM3, HadGEM2-ES, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 and CESM1-CAM5 are the most suitable GCMs for the projection of rainfall in Nigeria. The linear scaling method was found as the most suitable approach for downscaling of rainfall in terms of all the statistical indices used. It was found to downscale rainfall with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) in the range of 30.7–44.0%, while Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) was between 0.81 and 0.91, and modified coefficient of agreement (md) was between 0.82 and 0.88. Projection of rainfall showed no significant change in Nigeria over the century under RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 6.5, while RCP 8.5 showed a decrease in the last part of the century (2070–2099). The seasonal changes in rainfall showed an increase in rainfall in the range of 0–20% in most parts of the north. The methodology in this study can reduce the uncertainty inherent in climate change projection and produce better projection of possible spatial and temporal changes in annual and seasonal rainfall.

N2  - The occurrence of ectotherm disease vectors outside of their previous distribution area and the emergence of vector-borne diseases can be increasingly observed at a global scale and are accompanied by a growing number of studies which investigate the vast range of determining factors and their causal links. Consequently, a broad span of scientific disciplines is involved in tackling these complex phenomena. First, we evaluate the citation behaviour of relevant scientific literature in order to clarify the question "do scientists consider results of other disciplines to extend their expertise?" We then highlight emerging tools and concepts useful for risk assessment. Correlative models (regression-based, machine-learning and profile techniques), mechanistic models (basic reproduction number R 0) and methods of spatial regression, interaction and interpolation are described. We discuss further steps towards multidisciplinary approaches regarding new tools and emerging concepts to combine existing approaches such as Bayesian geostatistical modelling, mechanistic models which avoid the need for parameter fitting, joined correlative and mechanistic models, multi-criteria decision analysis and geographic profiling. We take the quality of both occurrence data for vector, host and disease cases, and data of the predictor variables into consideration as both determine the accuracy of risk area identification. Finally, we underline the importance of multidisciplinary research approaches. Even if the establishment of communication networks between scientific disciplines and the share of specific methods is time consuming, it promises new insights for the surveillance and control of vector-borne diseases worldwide. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Supplier selection is a multi-criteria decisionmaking problem. It also faces many risks and problems. The traditional evaluation and decision-making of suppliers is inefficient and subjective. In order to select the best bidding supplier more scientifically and effectively, considering the main influencing factors of supplier selection comprehensively, on the basis of using FAHP-TOPSIS method, a modeling method based on BP Neural Network is introduced to reduce the subjectivity of artificial evaluation in the process of supplier selection and improve the work efficiency and intelligence level of supplier selection.

N2  - The advances in technology and demand for luxury have induced increase in energy demand. However, the conventional energy resources due to its cost and impact on environment are becoming infeasible solution to satisfy the demand. As a result, alternative sources of energy such as solar, hydro, and sustainable energy resources are used to substitute the fossil fuels and satisfy the marginal demand for energy. Wave energy has a potential to satisfy the present energy demand. However, the expensive conversion procedures are one of the major deterrents which presented wider utilization of the resource. One of the reasons of costly conversion procedure is subjective- and experience-based selection of location and infeasible selection of parameters to identify a location from where maximum resources can be utilized under maximum expenditure. That is why, selection features by objective and unbiased method can reduce the cost of conversion and maximize the resource utilization. In this aspect, a new concept of “optimization techniques as multicriteria decision-making” was used to identify the major features in an objective and unbiased manner and compared with the results from analytical hierarchy process multicriteria decision-making method technique. While comparing the significance of the parameters wind speed, wave height, wind duration, water depth, fetch, and marine engineer, academicians and stakeholder criteria were used. The most significant parameters were evaluated with respect to the optimal as well as uncertain scenarios. The result shows that wind speed is the most significant parameter under normal and positive extreme scenario, respectively. The wind speed, water depth, and wave height are the most significant parameters with respect to optimization techniques such as differential evolution and genetic algorithms criteria for this normal and for the uncertain scenario. The index also provided a heuristic and cognitive optimal value to way from a suitability of utilization efficiency of wave energy power. Both models were able to fit the data well, with R2 values of 0.99127 and 0.97964 for the linear regression model and the polynomial neural network model, respectively. It was also found that the test data set had a mean absolute error of 0.07742 for the polynomial neural network model, while it was 0.06987 for the regression model.

N2  - In recent years, big data systems are getting increasingly complex and require a deep domain specific knowledge. Although a multitude of reference architectures exist, it remains challenging to identify the most suitable approach for a specific use case scenario. To overcome this problem and to provide a decision support, the design science research methodology is used. By an initial literature review process and the application of the software architecture comparison analysis method, currently established big data reference architectures are identified and compared to each other. Finally, an Analytic Hierarchy Process as the main artefact is proposed, demonstrated and evaluated on a real world use-case.

N2  - Nowadays, User-Generated Content (UGC) spreads across social media through Web 2.0 technologies, in the absence of traditional trusted third parties that can verify its credibility. The issue of assessing the credibility of UGC is a recent research topic, which has been tackled by many approaches as a classification problem: information is automatically categorized into genuine and fake, usually by employing data-driven solutions, based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In this paper, to address some open issues concerning the use of ML, and to give to the decision maker a major control on the process of UGC credibility assessment, the importance that the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) paradigm can have in association with the use of aggregation operators is discussed. Some potential aggregation schemes and their properties are illustrated, as well as some interesting research directions.

N2  - In personalized medicine for treating cancer, the most challenging task is to identify an adequate treatment for a given patient. The prediction of drug response can highly improve the clinical results and reduce the financial costs associated with chemotherapy treatment. In this paper, we present a new approach to improve the accuracy of predicting the sensitivity of cell lines to anticancer drugs. Our approach relies on selecting relevant features impacting the efficiency of predictive algorithms. We propose a multi-criteria recommendation method to identify the most accurate prediction algorithm according to the available input data. For each iteration, a different algorithm may be selected, and the optimal accuracy may be reached. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing approaches in estimating the sensitivity of cell lines to different drugs.

N2  - The paper has deal with the problem of public transport network design. Collected data about people’s travelling in urban area opens up new opportunities related to the design of novel solutions for analysing real needs of people. The issue is how to make a rational choice of preferable PTN according to: (i) a set of selected quality criteria; (ii) decision makers preferences. In the paper we propose a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method adopted for choice of PTN obtained automatically based on geospatial data analysis. The evaluation criteria of the PTN were developed for the particular task: (i) degree of transport demand satisfaction, (ii) coefficient of non-straightness, and (iii) transport network density. This technique was tested on the routes constructed by the expert, as well as on the automatically generated route. The results suggested by the expert and design in automation mode is close to each other in terms of efficiency. It lead to conclusion that data-driven approaches migh be used for urban planning and monitoring with minimal human intervention.

N2  - Concerning the significant increase in the negative effects of flash-floods worldwide, the main goal of this research is to evaluate the power of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), fi (kNN), K-Star (KS) algorithms and their ensembles in flash-flood susceptibility mapping. To train the two stand-alone models and their ensembles, for the first stage, the areas affected in the past by torrential phenomena are identified using remote sensing techniques. Approximately 70% of these areas are used as a training data set along with 10 flash-flood predictors. It should be remarked that the remote sensing techniques play a crucial role in obtaining eight out of 10 flash-flood conditioning factors. The predictive capability of predictors is evaluated through the Information Gain Ratio (IGR) method. As expected, the slope angle results in the factor with the highest predictive capability. The application of the AHP model implies the construction of ten pair-wise comparison matrices for calculating the normalized weights of each flash-flood predictor. The computed weights are used as input data in kNN-AHP and KS-AHP ensemble models for calculating the Flash-Flood Potential Index (FFPI). The FFPI also is determined through kNN and KS stand-alone models. The performance of the models is evaluated using statistical metrics (i.e., sensitivity, specificity and accuracy) while the validation of the results is done by constructing the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve and Area Under Curve (AUC) values and by calculating the density of torrential pixels within FFPI classes. Overall, the best performance is obtained by the kNN-AHP ensemble model.

N2  - A model for organizational performance evaluation is proposed. Organizational performance support can reduce barriers to applications of multi-criteria decision-making procedures. The relevant criteria of the proposed model were derived from an expert group interview to include the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which is performed to determine the weights of evaluation, and grey relational analysis (GRA), which is then performed to rank the organizational performance of the travel agency. The AHP is a measurement theory that prioritizes the hierarchy and consistency of judgmental data provided by a group of decision-makers. It incorporates the evaluations of all decision-makers into a final decision through pair-wise comparisons of the alternatives, without eliciting their utility functions on subjective and objective criteria. GRA examines the extent of connections between two digits through departing and scattering measurement methods. The combined AHP and GRA decision-making method can provide decision-makers with a valuable data analysis when evaluating organizational performance. Because the proposed model can inform organizational performance assessments, it is highly applicable to both academic and commercial organizational evaluation and development.

N2  - Ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) provide a low-cost alternative to traditional inpatient care. In addition, with health care reform imminent, it is likely that many currently uninsured people will soon acquire health care coverage, significantly increasing the demand for health services. ASCs are among the providers that can expect to see a substantial amount of this new pent-up demand and, therefore, ASCs are likely to continue their current growth into the foreseeable future. Those ASCs that plan accordingly by optimizing procedure mix and volume will benefit most from the increased demand. We propose a two-stage efficiency-based multicriteria decision model to guide an ASC in identifying its optimal procedure mix. The first stage uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to calculate the efficiency of each procedure based on the resources required to perform the procedure, the revenue it generates, and its risk of complications. The second stage uses the DEA factor efficiency scores in a bottleneck program to optimize the mix of procedures while satisfying the ASC's resource and operational constraints. The criteria are to (1) maximize reimbursement while (2) minimizing the total number of complications. We demonstrate the approach using a data set based in part on data from an actual ASC. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - The estimation of solar radiation for planning current and future periods in different fields, such as renewable energy generation, is very important for decision makers. The current study presents a hybrid model structure based on a multi-objective shark algorithm and fuzzy method for forecasting and generating a zone map for solar radiation as an alternative solution for future renewable energy production. The multi-objective shark algorithm attempts to select the best input combination for solar radiation (SR) estimation and the optimal value of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) parameter, and the power parameter of the inverse distance weight (IDW) is computed. Three provinces in Iran with different climates and air quality index conditions have been considered as case studies for this research. In addition, comparative analysis has been carried out with other models, including multi-objective genetic algorithm-ANFIS and multi-objective particle swarm optimization-ANFIS. The Taguchi model is used to obtain the best value of random parameters for multi-objective algorithms. The comparison of the results shows that the relative deviation index (RDI) of the distributed solutions in the Pareto front based multi-objective shark algorithm has the lowest value in the spread index, spacing metric index, favorable distribution, and good diversity. The generated Pareto solutions based on the multi-objective shark algorithm are compared to those based on the genetic algorithm and particle swarm algorithm and found to be the optimal and near ideal solutions. In addition, the determination of the best solution based on a multi-criteria decision model enables the best input to the model to be selected based on different effective parameters. Three different performance indices have been used in this study, including the root mean square error, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, and mean absolute error. The generated zone map based on the multi-objective shark algorithm-ANFIS highly matches with the observed data in all zones in all case studies. Additionally, the analysis shows that the air quality index (AQI) should be considered as effective input for SR estimation. Finally, the measurement and analysis of the uncertainty based on the multi-objective shark algorithm-ANFIS were carried out. As a result, the proposed new hybrid model is highly suitable for the generation of accurate zone mapping for different renewable energy generation fields. In addition, the proposed hybrid model showed outstanding performance for the development of a forecasting model for the solar radiation value, which is essential for the decision-makers to draw a future plan for generating renewable energy based solar radiation.

N2  - Recommender system (RS) is a web personalization tool for recommending appropriate items to users based on their preferences from a large set of available items. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most popular technique for recommending items based on the preferences of similar users. Most of the CF based RSs work only on the overall rating of the items, however, the overall rating is not a good representative of user preferences for an item. Our work in this paper, is an attempt towards incorporating of various criteria ratings into CF i.e., multi-criteria CF, for enhancing its accuracy through multi-linear regression. We suggest the use of multi-linear regression for determining the weights of individual criterion and computing the overall ratings of each item. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach outperforms the classical approaches.

N2  - As the era of big data approaches, big data has attracted increasing amounts of attention from researchers. Various types of studies have been conducted and these studies have focused particularly on the management, organization, and correlation of data and calculations using data. Most studies involving big data address applications in scientific, commercial, and ecological fields. However, the application of big data to government management is also needed. This paper examines the application of multi-source government data to urban construction and supervision in Tianjin, China. The analytic hierarchy process and a new approach called the correlation degree algorithm are introduced to calculate the degree of correlation between different approval items in one construction project and between different construction projects. The results show that more than 75% of the construction projects and their approval items are highly correlated. The results of this study suggest that most of the examined construction projects are well supervised, have relatively high probabilities of satisfying the relevant legal requirements, and observe their initial planning schemes.

N2  - Many distance measures have been proposed in in the literature for vague sets, some of those measures cannot satisfy the axioms of distance or provide counterintuitive cases. For certain situations using these distance measures, analysis reveal them incapable of discriminating between vague sets. Thus, the author propose a new distance measure to overcome the limitations of existing distance measures and apply it to a group multi-criteria decision making problem using Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. The new distance measure not only satisfies the axioms of distance measure, but also overcomes the counterintuitive cases. It appears thus to be a useful new distance measure between vague sets. A numerical example, as presented, augers well for practical adoption of the proposed distance measure for handling MCDM problem using TOPSIS method.

N2  - Investigation of temperature extremes is very important as one of the most important climate parameters in different parts. If exposed to enough heat, humans will suffer from extreme heat. Maximum temperature and heat can adversely affect many living organisms. The effects of extreme heat on people with chronic lung disease, including asthma and emphysema, are greater; even for people with healthy lungs, outdoor activities are not recommended during high ozone levels. The purpose of this study is to monitor and analyze the effects of atmospheric temperature extreme and extreme heat on human health in Central Iran. Therefore, the minimum and maximum data of 15 synoptic stations in the study area for the period (1988–2018) using hybrid artificial neural network (HANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models were used. Finally, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models TOSIS and SAW were used to prioritize the areas exposed to rising temperature. The results showed that according to ANFIS modelling for predicting extreme temperatures, the lowest mean training error and the mean error of validation for the minimum temperature were equal to 0.10 for the Yazd Station and 1.66% for the Damghan station. The lowest mean training error and the mean error of validation for the maximum extreme temperature obtained 0.016 for the Garmsar station and 9.39% for the Shahroud station. The maximum extreme temperature of two stations of Garmsar and Bafgh (1 and 0.9689, respectively) was more exposed to extreme temperatures based on the TOPSIS model. Garmsar and Salafchegan Stations (1 and 0.9873, respectively) were more exposed to extreme temperatures based on the SAW model. Climate change is fundamentally changing the Earth’s climate system in a way that directly and indirectly endangers human physical and mental health. Severe increase in temperature is directly associated with death from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, especially in the elderly. Also in the study area, the house is a place for peace and comfort for every human being. Climatic and weather conditions have a direct impact on creating a sense of comfort in any architectural space. Proper heating and air conditioning in the interior of the building is another case of architecture that will not be easy because this architectural issue is related to the comfort or non-comfort of man, and the concepts of heat or cold are mostly due to the natural feeling of man and his physiological conditions. The rising trend of thermal stresses in the studied stations increases the need to pay attention to the issue of thermal stresses and the spread of diseases (heat attack, syncope, and muscle cramps) in terms of crisis planning and management.

N2  - Objective: The main objective of the paper to incorporate the external web-data efficiently to web-warehouse, as the evolution of web and the requisite of data analytics necessitate it for effective decision support system. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Since the data owned of any organization is insufficient for decision support system. Nevertheless dynamic and complex nature of web pose various challenges during selection of relevant web-data. So evaluation of web resources to select as external source for web-warehouse is the crucial phase during warehousing. Various Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approaches have been used for it. All these approaches evaluate the web resources on the basis of a set of features which define the relevancy of the resource. Findings: The main focus is on one of the approaches of MCDM viz. "Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution" (TOPSIS) approach and also improvised the TOPSIS approach for efficient evaluation of the web resources. In traditional TOPSIS approach Euclidean distance has been measured to compute the proximity of real web-sources from Ideal web-sources. The Euclidean distance measure only the distances between the real and ideal web-resources but not the differences between them. In order to compute the differences between real and ideal web-resources Kullback-Leibler divergence method has been incorporated in the place of Euclidean distance method. Application/Improvements: The improvised TOPSIS computes symmetric as well as asymmetric distances to compute the differences, so efficient to compute the proximity in order to evaluation of web-resources.

N2  - Data mining techniques and extracting patterns from large datasets play a vital role in knowledge discovery. Most of the decision makers encounter a large number of decision rules resulted from association rules mining. Moreover, the volume of datasets brings a new challenge to extract patterns such as the cost of computing and inefficiency to achieve the relevant rules. To overcome these challenges, this paper aims to build a learning model based on FP-growth and Apache Spark framework to process and to extract relevant association rules. We also integrate the multi-criteria decision analysis to prioritize the extracted rules by taking into account the decision makers subjective judgment. We believe that this approach would be a useful model to follow, particularly for decision makers who are suffering from conflicts between extracted rules, and difficulties of building only the most interesting rules. Experimental results on road accidents analysis show that the proposed approach can be efficiently achieved more association rules with a higher accuracy rate and improve the response time of the proposed algorithm. The results make clear that the proposed approach performs well and can provide useful information that could help the decision makers to improve road safety.

N2  - The rise in the demand for energy from the burgeoning population has enhanced the importance of renewable energy resources to substitute conventional energy resources. In this regard, energy extracted from ocean waves is found to be one of the most reliable but expensive alternatives. The cost of installation and monitoring of wave energy converters are the reasons why it is not a popular alternative to replace fossil fuels. One of the major reasons for higher cost lies in the subjective methods adopted to monitor or predict the wave energy potential. Also very few studies were conducted to monitor the efficiency of the converters in utilization of the available potential. The present investigation is an attempt to propose an objective, unbiased and adaptive procedure to monitor as well as estimate the utilization efficiency of the wave energy converters. The method was experimented on the coastal regions of India, and the results encourage further application of the novel method.

N2  - The heterogeneous nature of 3GPP-LTE network allows global roaming for a range of mobile access network by providing higher data rate and higher bandwidth services. To maintain seamless connectivity during frequent handover experienced by the roaming users and to provide seamless connectivity, an intelligent Vertical Handover Decision (VHD) algorithm is proposed which uses neural network based SMART (Simple Multi Attribute Rating Technique) algorithm for choosing the best network by calculating a set of criteria. It also aims at reducing delay by improving the Quality of Service (QoS) and also reduces unnecessary handovers by avoiding connection failure. To show the applicability the proposed scheme is applied to LTE (Long Term Evaluation) wireless network by integrating WiFi and WiMax networks. The simulation result shows that the proposed scheme reduces delay, number of packets lost, rate of failure and also improves the QoS by providing seamless connectivity when compared to SAW, TOPSIS and TOPSIS with knapsack algorithm existing in the literature.

N2  - Advances in technology and an increase in the amount and complexity of data that are generated in healthcare have led to an indispensable revolution in this sector related to big data. Analytics of information based on multimodal clinical data sources requires big data projects. When starting big data projects in the healthcare sector, it is often necessary to assess the maturity of an organization with respect to big data, i.e., its capacity in managing big data. The assessment of the maturity of an organization requires multicriteria decision making as there is no single criterion or dimension that defines the maturity level regarding big data but an entire set of them. Based on the ISO 15504, this article proposes a fuzzy ELECTRE structure methodology to assess the maturity level of small- and medium-sized enterprises in the healthcare sector. The obtained experimental results provide evidence that this methodology helps to determine and compare maturity levels in big data management of organizations or the evolution of maturity over time. This is also useful in terms of diagnosing the readiness of an organization before starting to implement big data initiatives or technologies.

N2  - The advancement of network technology and the popularization of the Internet lead to increased interest in information recommendation. This paper proposes a group recommendation system that takes the preferences of group users in mobile environment and applies the system to recommendation of restaurants. The proposed system recommends the restaurants by considering various preferences of multiple users. To cope with the uncertainty in mobile environment, we exploit Bayesian network, which provides reliable performance and models individual user's preference. Also, Analytical Hierarchy Process of multi-criteria decisionmaking method is used to estimate the group users' preference from individual users' preferences. Experiments in 10 different situations provide a comparison of the proposed method with random recommendation, simple rule-based recommendation and neural network recommendation, and confirm that the proposed method is useful with the subjective test.

N2  - Electronic word-of-mouth (EWOM) is playing an important part in the consumer’s purchasing decision making across various shopping platforms. This is especially true in service sector, where the feedbacks covering the guest experience influence the adoption intention of potential consumers. The online ratings of various service aspects of the hotels posted by earlier users provide a comprehensive evaluation of their opinions and assessments on a standardized scale. In order to maximize utility, customers look for various candidate alternatives as well as the online ratings corresponding to it. This requires making a mathematical justification for precise decision making. Moreover, purchasing decisions incorporate hesitation among customers. To take care of these problems, this paper proposes a model applying multi criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques with online ratings of hotel. The objective of the paper is to rank hotels on the basis of online ratings of their attributes available on Tripadvisor. Firstly, the priorities of the service attributes, in the form of weights, are obtained using Neutrosophic Analytic Hierarchy Process (NAHP). The Neutrosophic set are an extension of fuzzy concept and has the advantage of handling hesitation in decision making process. We apply stochastic dominance along with the preference weights on the available ratings to obtain a comparison matrix of alternative. Finally, we make use of PROMETHEE technique to get the overall ranking of hotels. Future studies may include the role of online review text in the present model.

N2  - Success and effectiveness of websites are largely dependent on their quality. The biggest share of the quality of new concept is that technical aspects of products and services combine with customers usage and understanding. Therefore, websites evaluation based on the maximum usage and perception of the customers is considered an important issue to announce to the related organizations. This ranking and evaluation should be performed in a special activity domain so that the first place of website rank determines among its other competitors. In this article achieving the information of websites is automatic and without the intervention of human so that the instant evaluation could be possible. In this study, one of the multi criteria decision-making methods called TOPSIS is used and the weights of the criteria have been achieved on entropy method in the mentioned method. Eventually, according to the Alexa ranking report, 791 ranking news website have been obtained which have most visitors of Iranian users, but on the other hand, just a numerical rank as a final output of websites evaluation can not be very inconsistent with the purpose of competition between websites, so these numerical ranking from TOPSIS method used as output in machine learing method for separating websites from excellent to very poor in six categories as lables for training dataset in classification, instead of using manual lables achieved from experts and users' opinion. For this classification, machine learning techniques, including artificial neural network and support vector machine were used.

N2  - Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life due to their applications in weather forecasting, surveillance, implantable sensors for health monitoring and other plethora of applications. WSN is equipped with hundreds and thousands of small sensor nodes. As the size of a sensor node decreases, critical issues such as limited energy, computation time and limited memory become even more highlighted. In such a case, network lifetime mainly depends on efficient use of available resources. Organizing nearby nodes into clusters make it convenient to efficiently manage each cluster as well as the overall network. In this paper, we extend our previous work of grid-based hybrid network deployment approach, in which merge and split technique has been proposed to construct network topology. Constructing topology through our proposed technique, in this paper we have used analytical network process (ANP) model for cluster head selection in WSN. Five distinct parameters: distance from nodes (DistNode), residual energy level (REL), distance from centroid (DistCent), number of times the node has been selected as cluster head (TCH) and merged node (MN) are considered for CH selection. The problem of CH selection based on these parameters is tackled as a multi criteria decision system, for which ANP method is used for optimum cluster head selection. Main contribution of this work is to check the applicability of ANP model for cluster head selection in WSN. In addition, sensitivity analysis is carried out to check the stability of alternatives (available candidate nodes) and their ranking for different scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing energy efficient clustering protocols in terms of optimum CH selection and minimizing CH reselection process that results in extending overall network lifetime. This paper analyzes that ANP method used for CH selection with better understanding of the dependencies of different components involved in the evaluation process.

N2  - The purpose of spatial modelling in animal and public health is three-fold: describing existing spatial patterns of risk, attempting to understand the biological mechanisms that lead to disease occurrence and predicting what will happen in the medium to long-term future (temporal prediction) or in different geographical areas (spatial prediction). Traditional methods for temporal and spatial predictions include general and generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM) and Bayesian estimation methods. However, such models require both disease presence and absence data which are not always easy to obtain. Novel spatial modelling methods such as maximum entropy (MAXENT) and the genetic algorithm for rule set production (GARP) require only disease presence data and have been used extensively in the fields of ecology and conservation, to model species distribution and habitat suitability. Other methods, such as multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), use knowledge of the causal factors of disease occurrence to identify areas potentially suitable for disease. In addition to their less restrictive data requirements, some of these novel methods have been shown to outperform traditional statistical methods in predictive ability (Elith et al., 2006). This review paper provides details of some of these novel methods for mapping disease distribution, highlights their advantages and limitations, and identifies studies which have used the methods to model various aspects of disease distribution. © 2011.

N2  - Resilience is a complex system that represents dynamic behaviours through its complicated structure with various nodes, interrelations, and information flows. Like other international organizations NATO has also been dealing with the measurement of this complex phenomenon in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the civil environment and its impact on military operations. With this ultimate purpose, NATO had developed and executed a prototype model with the system dynamics modelling and simulation paradigm. NATO has created an aggregated resilience model as an upgrade of the prototype one, as discussed within this study. The structure of the model, aggregation mechanism and shock parametrization methodologies used in the development of the model comprise the scope of this study. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is a multi-criteria decision-making technique is the methodology that is used for the development of the aggregation mechanism. The main idea of selecting theAHPmethodology is its power and usefulness in mitigating bias in the decision-making process, its capability to increase the number of what-if scenarios to be created, and its contribution to the quality of causal explanations with the granularity it provides. The parametrized strategic shock input page, AHP-based weighted resilience and risk parameters input pages, one more country insertion to the model, and the decision support system page enhance the capacity of the prototype model. As part of the model, the decision support system page stands out as the strategic level cockpit where the colour codes give a clear idea at first about the overall situational picture and country-wise resilience and risk status. At the validation workshop, users not only validated the model but also discussed further development opportunities, such as adding more strategic shocks into the model and introduction of new parameters that will be determined by a big data analysis on relevant open source databases. The developed model has the potential to inspire high-level decision-makers dealing with resilience management in other international organizations, such as the United Nations.

N2  - Decision making is the thinking activity that people choose or judge, and scientific decision-making has always been a hot issue in the field of research. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a simple and practical multi-criteria and multi-objective decision-making method that combines quantitative and qualitative and can show and calculate the subjective judgment in digital form. In the process of decision analysis using AHP method, the rationality of the two-dimensional judgment matrix has a great influence on the decision result. However, in dealing with the real problem, the judgment matrix produced by the two-dimensional comparison is often inconsistent, that is, it does not meet the consistency requirements. BP neural network algorithm is an adaptive nonlinear dynamic system. It has powerful collective computing ability and learning ability. It can perfect the data by constantly modifying the weights and thresholds of the network to achieve the goal of minimizing the mean square error. In this paper, the BP algorithm is used to deal with the consistency of the two-dimensional judgment matrix of the AHP.

N2  - Landslides are one of the major natural and widespread geological hazards occurring in all over the world in every year. In the recent past, various landslide events have taken place in several regions in Sri Lanka due to a long spell of rain. It generates lots of fatalities and financial losses than the any other type of natural disasters as flood, cyclones, droughts, wind storms, coastal erosion and sea level rise. Thus, predicting the areas that are susceptible for landslides is essential for the purpose of effective land-use and disaster management activities in Sri Lanka. Koslanda is the most vulnerable area for landslides in Uwa Province of Sri Lanka and recently more devastating landslides are occurred resulting more damages to the human life and property. Hence, this area is selected as the study area for the landslide prediction modeling. With the recent developments of satellite images with high resolution, image analysis techniques and Geographical Information System (GIS) for spatial data analysis, variety of application using remote sensing and GIS as tools are emerging. The goal of this study is to generate landslide prediction models by using bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis on the thematic maps produced in GIS and remote sensing environment. Basically, the topographical, hydrological, land cover and soil factors are considered in order to determine the landslide susceptibility regions. The prediction levels of susceptibility regions are distinguished and categorized in to four susceptibility classes as Very low, Low, Moderate and High. Currently, the statistical methods are more applicable for landslide prediction than the qualitative approaches. Hence, the Information Value method (InfoVal method) as a bivariate and Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based on the Analytical Hieratical Process (AHP) as a multivariate statistical analysis had been performed. The InfoVal method combines the failure map with each thematic map to determine the weight of influence on terrain susceptibility for each parameter class. Integration of all weights of influences determines the terrain susceptibility levels for the landslides. The AHP is the structured technique for analysing and weighting multi criterions through the pair wise comparison. Hence, each thematic map are analysed through the MCDA based on the AHP theoretical concepts. Discretized landslide susceptible regions from InfoVal method and MCDA based on AHP are validated by using the relative failure density values generated from the validation samples in the failure map. Finally, as this research depict, despite their simplicity, bivariate statistical methods have more acceptable precision than multivariate methods, and consequently, they are more compatible with the landslide prediction modeling. Therefore, the result of this study can be used in the preliminary hazard mapping and selecting suitable location for future land use planning.

N2  - Control and supervisory systems have become an important pillar for Automation with the advancement and development of Industry 4.0. These systems are used to reconcile field data with operator analysis, and they are responsible for supporting to the monitoring, analysis, controlling and management of the industrial process. Knowing this, the use of regulations, recommendations and indicators are needed. In this context, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems use factory floor information as an input to alarm management systems in order to control and maintain the plant under operation. The failure event is the consequence of an alarm that has been suppressed or disregarded by the operator, but since the alarm system has been designed in a recommended manner, this occurrence should be displayed and recorded in the event log. Therefore, this record of failures can be analyzed, extracting knowledge of it (quantitative knowledge) and reconciling with the tacit knowledge of the operator (qualitative knowledge) in order to make a better and more clear understanding of the process for an accurate decision making, aiming the reestablishment of the production. However, few systems have the capacity to treat quali-quanti information in parallel and, therefore, the purpose of this paper is to present a model that reconciles such knowledge with a focus on the prioritization of the alarms according to the alarm management regulation ISA SP 18.2. In this context, mining and data analysis tools, and multi-criteria decision making methods are used to elucidate this problematization.
