abstract = {Utilizing multi-criteria decision analysis as an alternative to traditional screening processes for GIS modeling for landfill site selection (LSS) has attracted significant interest in recent years because of its time and cost savings and its ability to achieve better validation and accuracy. This paper surveys the developments in the modeling of LSS using geographic information systems (GIS) on the basis of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in the past two decades from 1997 to 2014. Emphasis is placed on the third and fifth stages of the overall applied methodology (selection of weights and decision rules), as well as on the efficiency of the LSS models. From the review, the strengths and limitations of using MCDA for LSS modeling via GIS are identified. Moreover, artificial neural networks instead of MCDA can be used as a new approach in the third and fifth stages of LSS models to enhance validation and accuracy.},

abstract = {Artificial neural networks have gone through a recent rise in popularity, achieving state-of-the-art results in various fields, including image classification, speech recognition, and automated control. Both the performance and computational complexity of such models are heavily dependant on the design of characteristic hyper-parameters (e.g., number of hidden layers, nodes per layer, or choice of activation functions), which have traditionally been optimized manually. With machine learning penetrating low-power mobile and embedded areas, the need to optimize not only for performance (accuracy), but also for implementation complexity, becomes paramount. In this work, we present a multi-objective design space exploration method that reduces the number of solution networks trained and evaluated through response surface modelling. Given spaces which can easily exceed 1020 solutions, manually designing a near-optimal architecture is unlikely as opportunities to reduce network complexity, while maintaining performance, may be overlooked. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that hyper-parameters which perform well on specific datasets may yield sub-par results on others, and must therefore be designed on a per-application basis. In our work, machine learning is leveraged by training an artificial neural network to predict the performance of future candidate networks. The method is evaluated on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets, optimizing for both recognition accuracy and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can closely approximate the Pareto-optimal front, while only exploring a small fraction of the design space.},

abstract = {Multi-criteria decision making problem has been well studied for many years. One popular query for multi-criteria decision making is top-k queries which require each user to specify an exact utility function. In many cases, the utility function of a user is probabilistic and finding the distribution on the utility functions has been widely explored in the machine learning areas, such as user's recommender systems, Bayesian learning models and user's preference elicitation, for improving user's experience. Motivated by this, we propose a new type of queries called k-hit queries, which has not been studied before. Given a set D of tuples in the database, the distribution θ on utility functions and a positive integer k, we would like to select a set of k tuples from D in order to maximize the probability that at least one of tuples in the selection set is the favorite of a user. All applications for top-k queries can naturally be used in k-hit queries. In this paper, we present various interesting properties of k-hit queries. Besides, based on these properties, we propose a novel algorithm called k-hit_Alg for k-hit queries. Finally, we conducted comprehensive experiments to show that the performance of our proposed method, k hit_Alg, is superior compared with other existing algorithms which were originally used to answer other existing queries.},

abstract = {The more cloud providers in the market the more information users have to handle to choose the best and suitable option for their application or business. The diversity in cloud services is a challenge for automated decision making in the multi-cloud environment. These decisions become more complex when the application's requirements and the application owner's constraints need to be satisfied throughout the application life cycle.This paper presents the concept of an Adaptive Decision Making Broker (ADMB) for multi-cloud management. ADMB aims to provide multi-criteria decision making using machine learning in a multi-cloud environment. In this context, we believe that our proposed methodology has the potential to provide optimal solutions as well as handle trade-offs between the functional and the non-functional requirements of given application.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role in connecting the physical world with the cyber world through new services and seamless interconnection between heterogeneous devices. Such heterogeneous devices tend to generate a massive volume of Big Data. However, exploiting green schemes for IoT is still a challenge since IoT attains a large scale and becomes more multifaceted, the current trends of analyzing Big Data are not directly applicable to it. Similarly, achieving green IoT through the use of 5G also poses new challenges when it comes to transferring huge volume of data in an efficient way. To address the challenges above, this paper presents a scheme for human- enabled green IoT in 5G network. Green IoT is achieved by grouping mobile nodes in a cluster. Also, a mobility management model is designed that helps in triggering efficient handover and selecting optimal networks based on multi-criteria decision modeling. Afterward, we design a network architecture that integrates green IoT with 5G network. Moreover, the 5G network architecture is supported by proposed protocol stack, which maps Internet Protocol (IP), Medium Access Protocol (MAC), and Location identifiers (LOC). The proposed scheme is also implemented using C programming language to validate mobility model in 5G, regarding cost, energy, and Quality of Service.},

isbn = {9783642223617},
publisher = {Springer-Verlag},
address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {The open nature of exploratory learning leads to situations when feedback is needed to address several conceptual difficulties. Not all, however, can be addressed at the same time, as this would lead to cognitive overload and confuse the learner rather than help him/her. To this end, we propose a personalised context-dependent feedback prioritisation mechanism based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Neural Networks (NN). AHP is used to define feedback prioritisation as a multi-criteria decision-making problem, while NN is used to model the relation between the criteria and the order in which the conceptual difficulties should be addressed. When used alone, AHP needs a large amount of data from experts to cover all possible combinations of the criteria, while the AHP-NN synergy leads to a general model that outputs results for any such combination. This work was developed and tested in an exploratory learning environment for mathematical generalisation called eXpresser.},
