AB  - Pairs trading is a popular speculation strategy. Several implementation methods are proposed in the literature: they can be based on a distance criterion or on co-integration. This article extends previous research in another direction: the combination of forecasting techniques (Neural Networks) and multi-criteria decision making methods (Electre III). The key contribution of this paper is the introduction of multi-step-ahead forecasts. It leads to major changes in the trading system and raises new empirical and methodological questions. The results of an application based on S&P 100 Index stocks are promising: this methodology could be a powerful tool for pairs selection in a highly non-linear environment.

AB  - Dynamic optimization problems involving two or more conflicting objectives appear in many real-world scenarios, and more cases are expected to appear in the near future with the increasing interest in the analysis of streaming data sources in the context of Big Data applications. However, approaches combining dynamic multi-objective optimization with preference articulation are still scarce. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic multi-objective optimization algorithm called InDM2 that allows the preferences of the decision maker (DM) to be incorporated into the search process. When solving a dynamic multi-objective optimization problem with InDM2, the DM can not only express her/his preferences by means of one or more reference points (which define the desired region of interest), but these points can be also modified interactively. InDM2 is enhanced with methods to graphically display the different approximations of the region of interest obtained during the optimization process. In this way, the DM is able to inspect and change, in optimization time, the desired region of interest according to the information displayed. We describe the main features of InDM2 and detail how it is implemented. Its performance is illustrated using both synthetic and real-world dynamic multi-objective optimization problems.

AB  - Renewable energy utilisation, latent energy storage, optimal system design, and robust system operation are critical elements for carbon-free buildings and communities. Machine learning methods are effective to assist the energy-efficient renewable systems during multi-criteria design and multi-level uncertainty-based operation periods. However, the current literature provides little knowledge on this topic. In this study, a state-of-the-art-review on phase change materials for cooling applications is presented, in terms of smart ventilations, intelligent PCMs charging/discharging, deterministic parametrical analysis, stochastic uncertainty-based performance prediction and optimisation. Furthermore, technical effectiveness of machine learning methods in single and multi-objective optimisations has been presented, through hybrid PCMs integrated renewable systems. Multivariables involved in the review include thermo-physical, geometrical and operating parameters of PCMs. Multi-criteria employed in the review include heat transfer rate, cooling energy storage density, heat storage and release efficiency, and indoor thermal comfort. The literature review presents technical challenges, such as tradeoff solutions between computational accuracy and efficiency, generic methods for effective selection amongst multi-diversified optimal solutions along the Pareto front, the general methodology for multi-level uncertainty quantification, smart controllers with accurate predictions under high-level parameters’ uncertainty and stochastic occupants’ behaviors. The future outlook and recommendations of machine learning methods in PCMs integrated cooling systems have also been presented as avenues for upcoming research.

AB  - A proactive mechanism to learn an efficient strategy for adaptive resource clusters is proposed. In contrast to reactive techniques, that rescale the cluster to fit the past load, a predictive strategy is adopted. The cluster incoming workload is forecasted and an optimization problem is defined whose solution is the optimal action according to a utility function. Genetic-based machine learning techniques are used, including multi-objective evolutionary algorithms under the distal supervised learning setup. Experimental evaluations show that the proactive system presented in this work improves either the energetic efficiency or the number of reconfigurations of previous approaches without a loss in the quality of service. Depending on the predictability of the workload, in real world cluster scenarios additional energy savings of up to approximately 40% were measured over the best previous approach, with a 2× factor increment in the number of reconfigurations.

AB  - Abstract.
Travelers can enjoy a wide range of choices with the assistance of online review websites such as TripAdvisor. Online reviews provided by customers are an important portion of hotels' online business worldwide as they have value in terms of understanding customers' observations of hotels' product and service features. Hotel managers seek to understand travelers' satisfaction and hotel preferences through online reviews to improve their marketing strategy and decision making. This research uses the travelers' generated content in online hotel reviews to provide reasonable and benchmarking understandings about customers' satisfaction and preferences. Hence, the aim of this study is identifying the important factors for hotel selection based on previous travelers' reviews on TripAdvisor. Accordingly, we develop a new method for the use of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) and soft computing approaches. Concentrating on the case study of the Canary Islands hotels, we show how this method can be applied to determine the satisfaction and preferences among travelers that impact their decision in hotel choices. The results help to identify four customer segments for Canary Islands hotels. These segments are “Highly Satisfied Travelers”, “Satisfied Travelers”, “Moderately Satisfied Travelers”, and “Unsatisfied Travelers”, showing that different travelers have various degrees of satisfaction with dissimilar preferences. We found that travelers' preference and satisfaction segmentation is a crucial stage in travelers' behavior analysis to improve the quality of hotels' products and services. This form of analysis can enhance hotel managers' understanding of different market segments according to customers’ satisfaction level and their preferences. The findings of this study will help managers to set priority instructions for improving the corresponding hotel features and use online customer reviews to improve customer satisfaction and hotel performance.

AB  - Supplier evaluation and selection constitutes a central issue in supply chain management (SCM). However, the data on which to base the corresponding choices in real life problems are often imprecise or vague, which has led to the introduction of fuzzy approaches. Predictive intelligent-based techniques, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), have been recently applied in different research fields to model fuzzy multi-criteria decision processes where the understanding and learning of the relationships between the input and output data are the key to select suitable solutions. In this paper, a hybrid ANFIS-ANN model is proposed to assist managers in their supplier evaluation process. After aggregating the data set through the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), the most influential criteria on the suppliers’ performance are determined by ANFIS. Then, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to predict and rank the suppliers’ performance based on the most effective criteria. A case study is presented to illustrate the main steps of the model and show its accuracy in prediction. A battery of parametric tests and sensitivity analyses has been implemented to evaluate the overall performance of several models based on different effective criteria combinations.

AB  - This paper presents the integration of a cognitive architecture with an intelligent decision support model (IDSM) that is embedded into an autonomous non-deterministic safety critical system. The IDSM will integrate multi-criteria decision making via intelligent technologies like expert systems, fuzzy logic, machine learning and genetic algorithms. Cognitive technology is currently simulated in safety–critical systems to highlight variables of interest, interface with intelligent technologies, and provide an environment that improves a system’s cognitive performance. In this study, the IDSM is being applied to an actual safety–critical system, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) software. The USV’s safety performance is being researched in a simulated and a real world nautical based environment. The objective is to build a dynamically changing model to evaluate a cognitive architecture’s ability to ensure safe performance of an intelligent safety–critical system. The IDSM does this by finding a set of key safety performance parameters that can be critiqued via safety measurements, mechanisms and methodologies. The uniqueness of this research will be on bounding the decision making associated with the cognitive architecture’s key safety parameters (KSP). Other real-time applications that could benefit from advancing the safety of cognitive technologies are unmanned platforms, transportation technologies, and service robotics. The results will provide cognitive science researchers a reference for safety engineering artificially intelligent safety–critical systems.

AB  - Decision support systems aim to help a decision maker with selecting the option from a set of available options that best meets her or his needs. In multi-criteria based decision support approaches, a suitability degree is computed for each option, reflecting how suitable that option is considering the preferences of the decision maker. Nowadays, it becomes more and more common that data of different quality, originating from different data sets and different data providers have to be integrated and processed in order to compute the suitability degrees. Also, data sets can be very large such that their data become commonly prone to incompleteness, imprecision and uncertainty. Hence, not all data used for decision making can be trusted to the same extent and consequently, neither the results of computations with such data can be trusted to the same extent. For this reason, data quality assessment becomes an important aspect of a decision making process. To correctly inform the users, it is essential to communicate not only the computed suitability degrees of the available options, but also the confidence about these suitability degrees as can be derived from data quality assessment. In this paper a novel multi-dimensional approach for data quality assessment in multi-criteria decision making, supporting the computation of associated confidence degrees, is presented. Providing confidence information adds an extra dimension to the decision making process and leads to more soundly decisions. The added value of the approach is illustrated with aspects of a geographic decision making process.

AB  - The assessment of biomass at high spatial resolution is critical to manage supply risks and to identify optimal plant sites for producing sustainable biofuels and co-products. The spatial variabilities in soil type, topography, climate, and crop management practices further require vast computational time and resources to estimate the availability of sustainable biomass for a large study area. In this study, we developed a GIS-based integrated predictive modeling platform to assess the availability of sustainable crop residues at high spatial (30 m) and temporal (2010–2022) scales. A GIS-based multi-criteria inclusion-exclusion analysis and facility location-allocation models were used to identify suitable sites, and optimal siting of biogas plants respectively with biomass delivered cost. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based predictive models were well suited to predict sustainability indicators (soil erosion SE- R2 = 0.96, soil conditioning index, SCI R2 = 0.98 and organic matter factor, OMF- R2 = 0.83) for assessing sustainable removal rates of crop residues (corn stover and wheat straw). The GIS-based integrated model was applied to the State of Ohio and found that about 4–13 dry Tg of crop residues can be sustainably available to build 1–25 regional biogas plants. A typical optimal biogas plant with a feedstock capacity of up to 500 dry Gg could be drawn from a transport radius of about 19–35 km with a delivered cost of 40–46 $ dry Mg−1. The temporal and spatial variations in assessing the availability of biomass largely affected the supply chain decisions and its delivered costs.

AB  - Application of super-insulating materials in building glazing system shows promising prospects for low-energy buildings. In this research, the heat transfer, solar radiation transmission and indoor illuminance of an aerogel glazing system were characterized through an experimentally validated numerical model. Contribution ratios of multi-variables to multi-objectives were thereafter quantified, following the Taguchi standard orthogonal array. In respect to the application of aerogel glazing system in subtropical climates, an energy-related contradiction between indoor illuminance from solar and indoor heat gain, has been presented, discussed, together with effective solutions. In order to minimise the total heat gain and maximise the indoor illuminance transmitted through the aerogel glazing system, a generic multi-objective optimisation methodology, with high computational efficiency and accuracy, has been developed, to identify the optimal design. The results indicate that through the Pareto front from the multi-objective optimisation results, a significant reduction of total heat gain and an obvious increase of the indoor illuminance can be noticed. Compared to the optimal case in the standard orthogonal array, with the application of the proposed multi-objective optimisation methodology, the annual total heat gain could be reduced from 489305.5 to 333396.4 Wh by 31.9% and the annual indoor illuminance could be increased from 56786.6 to 172973.5 lux by 67.2%. The year-round performance indicates that, compared to the bi-objective optimisation (annual transmitted heat gain and annual indoor illuminance) with the annual total heat gain at 333.4 kWh/m2 and annual indoor illuminance at 162.3 klux, the bi-objective optimisation (annual total heat gain and annual indoor illuminance) shows a lower annual total heat gain at 322.4 kWh/m2 by 3.4%) and a higher annual indoor illuminance at 173 klux by 6.6%. This study proposes an overall framework and technical guidance of a new multi-objective optimisation methodology, which can automatically learn mechanisms of heat transfer and solar radiation transmittance through nanoporous aerogel granules, and identify the optimal multi-variables setting for the robust system design and operation.

AB  - Gully erosion is considered as a severe environmental problem in many areas of the world which causes huge damages to agricultural lands and infrastructures (i.e. roads, buildings, and bridges); however, gully erosion modeling and prediction with high accuracy are still difficult due to the complex interactions of various factors. The objective of this research was to develop and introduce three new ensemble models, which were based on Complex Proportional Assessment of Alternatives (COPRAS), Logistic Regression (LR), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Random Forest (RF), and Frequency Ratio (FR) for spatial prediction of gully erosion with a case study at the Najafabad watershed (Iran). For this purpose, a total of 290 head-cut of gullies and 17 conditioning factors were collected and used to establish a geospatial database. Subsequently, FR was used to determine the spatial relationship between the conditioning factors and the head-cut of gullies, whereas RF, BRT, and LR were used to quantify the relative importance of these factors. In the next step, three ensemble gully erosion models, named COPRAS-FR-RF, COPRAS-FR-BRT, and COPRAS-FR-LR were developed and verified. The Success Rate Curve (SRC), and the Prediction Rate Curve (PRC) and their areas under the curves (AUC) were used to check the performance of the three proposed models. The result showed that Soil group, geomorphology, and drainage density factors played the key role on the occurrence of the gully erosion. All the three models have very high degree-of-fit and the prediction performance, the COPRAS-FR-RF model (AUC-SRC = 0.974 and AUC-PRC = 0.929), the COPRAS-FR-BRT model (AUC-SRC = 0.973 and AUC-PRC = 0.928), and the COPRAS-FR-LR model (AUC-SRC = 0.972 and AUC-PRC = 0.926); therefore, it is concluded that they are efficient and new powerful tools which could be used for predicting gully erosion in prone-areas.

AB  - Emergency Department (ED) overcrowding is a public health issue associated with harmful effects simultaneously on patients and ED staff. Despite increased policies and efforts to manage this issue, it continues to rise in many EDs all over the world. ED overcrowding is not caused only by the high number of incoming patients and resources shortage, the most affecting factor leading to such problem is the inpatient boarding. In fact, the patient has to wait too long for an available hospital bed. This paper suggests a new approach to improve the inpatient flow using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods. The aim is to make a rational choice of the appropriate department in the ward to which the inpatient can be assigned even if the department related to its pathology is already crowded. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based Delphi is used to collect data. Then, the AHP method is used to determine the weights of criteria that have an impact on the assignment decision. Finally, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE) II, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) II are applied separately to rank the possible inpatient departments in ward in decreasing order of suitability to patient’s pathology. The provided approach is tested to the ED of Habib Bourguiba University hospital of Sfax, Tunisia where the aggregation of AHP-Delphi and TOPSIS is considered.

AB  - Objective
Manual evaluation of machine learning algorithms and selection of a suitable classifier from the list of available candidate classifiers, is highly time consuming and challenging task. If the selection is not carefully and accurately done, the resulting classification model will not be able to produce the expected performance results. In this study, we present an accurate multi-criteria decision making methodology (AMD) which empirically evaluates and ranks classifiers’ and allow end users or experts to choose the top ranked classifier for their applications to learn and build classification models for them.
Methods and material
Existing classifiers performance analysis and recommendation methodologies lack (a) appropriate method for suitable evaluation criteria selection, (b) relative consistent weighting mechanism, (c) fitness assessment of the classifiers’ performances, and (d) satisfaction of various constraints during the analysis process. To assist machine learning practitioners in the selection of suitable classifier(s), AMD methodology is proposed that presents an expert group-based criteria selection method, relative consistent weighting scheme, a new ranking method, called optimum performance ranking criteria, based on multiple evaluation metrics, statistical significance and fitness assessment functions, and implicit and explicit constraints satisfaction at the time of analysis. For ranking the classifiers performance, the proposed ranking method integrates Wgt.Avg.F-score, CPUTimeTesting, CPUTimeTraining, and Consistency measures using the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The final relative closeness score produced by TOPSIS, is ranked and the practitioners select the best performance (top-ranked) classifier for their problems in-hand.
Findings
Based on the extensive experiments performed on 15 publically available UCI and OpenML datasets using 35 classification algorithms from heterogeneous families of classifiers, an average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.98 is observed. Similarly, the AMD method has showed improved performance of 0.98 average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient as compared to 0.83 and 0.045 correlation coefficient of the state-of-the-art ranking methods, performance of algorithms (PAlg) and adjusted ratio of ratio (ARR).
Conclusion and implication
The evaluation, empirical analysis of results and comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the feasibility of AMD methodology, especially the selection and weighting of right evaluation criteria, accurate ranking and selection of optimum performance classifier(s) for the user's application's data in hand. AMD reduces expert's time and efforts and improves system performance by designing suitable classifier recommended by AMD methodology.

AB  - The recent crisis highlighted, once again, the importance of early warning models to assess the soundness of individual banks. In the present study, we use six quantitative techniques originating from various disciplines to classify banks in three groups. The first group includes very strong and strong banks; the second one includes adequate banks, while the third group includes banks with weaknesses or serious problems. We compare models developed with financial variables only, with models that incorporate additional information in relation to the regulatory environment, institutional development, and macroeconomic conditions. The accuracy of classification of the models that include only financial variables is rather poor. We observe a substantial improvement in accuracy when we consider the country-level variables, with five out of the six models achieving out-of-sample classification accuracy above 70% on average. The models developed with multi-criteria decision aid and artificial neural networks achieve the highest accuracies. We also explore the development of stacked models that combine the predictions of the individual models at a higher level. While the stacked models outperform the corresponding individual models in most cases, we found no evidence that the best stacked model can outperform the best individual model.

AB  - The topic of clustering has been widely studied in the field of Data Analysis, where it is defined as an unsupervised process of grouping objects together based on notions of similarity. Clustering in the field of Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) has seen a few adaptations of methods from Data Analysis, most of them however using concepts native to that field, such as the notions of similarity and distance measures. As in MCDA we model the preferences of a decision maker over a set of decision alternatives, we can find more diverse ways of comparing them than in Data Analysis. As a result, these alternatives may also be arranged into different potential structures. In this paper we wish to formally define the problem of clustering in MCDA using notions that are native to this field alone, and highlight the different structures which we may try to uncover through this process. Following this we propose a method for finding these structures. As in any clustering problem, finding the optimal result in an exact manner is impractical, and so we propose a stochastic heuristic approach, which we validate through tests on a large set of artificially generated benchmarks.

AB  - Effective evaluation of community livability is in urgent need to avoid increased livability at the expense of sustainability. However, studies concerning community livability evaluation were still conceptual, qualitative or conducted at city or regional scales. The availability of abundant, fine-grained, and multi-source data in the big data era laid the foundation for comprehensive livability evaluation at much finer scales. This paper proposed a quantitative and practical method for up-to-date livability evaluation at individual community scale in China. Nine evaluation criteria were identified spanning dimensions of environment, traffic, convenience, and population. These criteria were calculated respectively from remote sensing, surface observation and geospatial big data. The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was applied for community livability evaluation, and the uncertainty and sensitivity of evaluation results were assessed. The livability evaluation in the case study area of Haidian District, Beijing, China demonstrated the practicality and effectiveness of the framework. A total number of 1242 communities in Haidian District were evaluated. Communities in urban area were generally associated with higher evaluation scores and lower uncertainties than those in rural area. The careful selection of criteria weights with high sensitivity, i.e., green space coverage within community and driving time to schools, can potentially significantly reduce the uncertainty of the livability evaluation. The community scale livability evaluation is expected to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementations of livability evaluation, and enables the development of more effective and locally specific regulations and policies to improve community livability.

AB  - Within unmanned aerial vehicles on-going research topics, automatic target recognition is acquiring relevance. This is due to the easiness with which it is possible to acquire such devices. In order to do this, signal processing and classification techniques could be adopted. Also, in order to improve the classification ratio, optimization techniques could be used. This subject is object of study for many researchers, but the authors worry about the lack of information while using single-objective optimization techniques. The proposed work comprises the application of multi-objective optimization design in order to create an automatic target recognition system to discriminate different types of unmanned aerial vehicles. In order to accomplish this, a K-band radar system is used to send and receive electromagnetic signals, which are then processed with feature extraction techniques, and finally, applied on an artificial neural network system. In order to improve the system’s classification ratio, the classifier is defined as a multi-objective problem, and evolutionary multi-objective optimization techniques are applied. Finally, in order to select the best possible trade-off, the level diagrams multi-criteria decision making methodology is used to compare different solutions.

AB  - High data quality is a prerequisite for accurate data analysis. However, data inconsistencies often arise in real data, leading to untrusted decision making downstream in the data analysis pipeline. In this paper, we study the problem of inconsistency detection and repair of the Ontology Multi-dimensional Data Model (OMD). We propose a framework of data quality assessment, and repair for the OMD. We formally define a weight-based repair-by-deletion semantics, and present an automatic weight generation mechanism that considers multiple input criteria. Our methods are rooted in multi-criteria decision making that consider the correlation, contrast, and conflict that may exist among multiple criteria, and is often needed in the data cleaning domain.

AB  - The unique ability of shape memory alloy or smart alloy to memorize its previous form has drawn notable attention recently in a wide range of commercial applications. In efforts to precisely predict and compare few significant WEDM machinability aspects like surface roughness [arithmetic mean roughness (Ra), root mean square roughness (Rq) and maximum peak-to-valley height (Rz)] and micro-hardness (MH) of shape memory alloy nitinol, general regression neural network (GRNN) model was developed. Five critical machining parameter, namely pulse-on time (TON), discharge current (I), wire feed (WF), wire tension (WT) and flushing pressure (FP) were taken as machining input for the experiments. The grid search method was employed to minimize cross-validation error. The developed GRNN model predicted the responses within ±10% error indicating GRNN as a competent strategy to predict WEDM responses. A multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach, Fuzzy logic coupled with multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (MOORA) is introduced to optimize different correlated responses. The parametric combination, TON = 12 µs, I = 10 A, WT = 12 N, WS = 150 mm/s. and FP = 8 Bar, were found to yield the preferred results. ANOVA test shows the efficiency of this hybrid MCDM model. Confirmation test has been done to validate the optimum process combination which demonstrates the improvement in WEDM responses. FESEM micrographs identifies lump of debris, micro cracks, pockmarks and recast layer in the machined surfaces.

AB  - Hot-dip galvanizing is considered one of the most important corrosion protection alternatives for steel; however, its poor environmental performance has been a matter of concern. Even though many researchers have dealt with this topic in the past none of them have jointly dealt with the triple bottom line of sustainable development, and with the random and epistemic uncertainty of its measurement. For that reason, in this work, the sustainability of the hot-dip galvanizing process is investigated integrating: (a) 17 indicators taken from the 4 categories of the GREENSCOPE methodology and one quality performance indicator which is directly related to ISO 1461. (b) The additive utility method for multi-criteria decision-making. (c) The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process used to calculate the relative weights of both indicators and categories by means of a survey. (d) The hierarchical partitioning analysis used for determining the process stages that have a higher impact on sustainability variation, and others useful and suitable statistical tools for data analysis. Furthermore, the proposed framework is tested for a particular hot-dip galvanizing process, considering a random generation of each batch size, steel item characteristics and operating conditions via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. The results show that the stages of pickling and fluxing are critical for the analyzed system and they are not expected to be improved without a significant modification of the process. The proposal outlined in this paper might help designers, process engineers and researchers for a better decision-making process, focusing on the most critical stages while considering the trade-off between the three dimensions of sustainable development.

AB  - This paper presents an efficiency assessment of African airlines, using the TOPSIS – Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution. TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision making technique, which similar to DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis), ranks a finite set of units based on the minimisation of distance from an ideal point, and the maximisation of distance from an anti-ideal point. In this research, TOPSIS is used first in a two-stage approach, in order to assess the relative efficiency of African airlines using the most frequent indicators adopted by the literature on airlines. During the second stage, neural networks are combined with TOPSIS results, as part of an attempt to produce a model for airline performance which has effective predictive ability. The results reveal that network size-related variables – economies of scope, are the most important variables for explaining levels of efficiency in the African airline industry, although the impact of fleet mix and public ownership cannot be neglected.

AB  - Forest fires threaten a large part of the world's forests, communities, and industrial plants, triggering technological accidents (Natechs). Forest fire modelling with respect to contributing spatial parameters is one of the well-known ways not only to predict the fire occurrence in forests, but also to assess the risk of forest-fire-induced Natechs. This study is a review of methods based on geospatial information system (GIS) for modelling forest fires and their potential Natechs that have been implemented all over the world. The present study conducts a systematic literature review of the methods used for forest fire susceptibility, hazard, and risk assessment, while dividing them into four general categories: (a) statistical and data-driven models; (b) machine learning models; (c) multi-criteria decision-making models, and (d) ensemble models. In addition, some forest fire detection techniques using satellite imagery are reviewed. A comparison is also conducted to highlight the research gaps and required future research. The results of the present research assist decision makers to select the most appropriate techniques according to specific forest conditions. Results show that data-driven approaches are the most frequently applied methods while ensemble approaches are more accurate.

AB  - The design of funicular (or momentless) submerged arches has a great application in the fields of the building construction and the civil engineering. Traditional approaches in this field have been based on the resolution of ordinary differential equations that govern the structural behavior of the submerged arches. Indeed, these approaches only consider a design parameter and they are computationally expensive. For intermediate depth ratios, the funicular shape of the arch lays about halfway between the geometric forms of the parabola and the ellipse. Actually, the arch centerline could be modeled as a parametric linear function of these two conical shapes where different parameters are established, opening new opportunities for the optimization in the design of such structures, which also consider several design parameters. In this article, we propose a methodology to optimize several parameters in the design of submerged arches. Specifically, we focus on the reduction of the arch bending moment, which is a critical factor in the design cost of the structure, and also the maximization of the airspace enclosed by the arch, which is of particular interest in the serviceability of recreational submerged installations. Our methodology is based on a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which uses artificial neural networks with extreme learning machine (ELM) to predict the level of bending stresses at the submerged arch under different shape configurations and also reduce the overall computational cost. Two groups of test examples, corresponding to deep and shallow waters, are developed to compare the numerical results obtained by multi-objective optimization with the theoretical curves predicted by the traditional funicular analysis. Our experimental results offer good accuracy (R2 up to 93%) in the fitness evaluation using ELM. After the multi-objective optimization procedure, our results show optimal arch-shapes with minimum bending stress (i.e., minimum cost) and maximum airspace; thus, the functionality of the underwater installation is also optimal.

AB  - Context
People who have recently recovered from the threat of deteriorating coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have antibodies to the coronavirus circulating in their blood. Thus, the transfusion of these antibodies to deteriorating patients could theoretically help boost their immune system. Biologically, two challenges need to be surmounted to allow convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue the most severe COVID-19 patients. First, convalescent subjects must meet donor selection plasma criteria and comply with national health requirements and known standard routine procedures. Second, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems should be considered in the selection of the most suitable CP and the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19.
Objective
This paper presents a rescue framework for the transfusion of the best CP to the most critical patients with COVID-19 on the basis of biological requirements by using machine learning and novel MCDM methods.
Method
The proposed framework is illustrated on the basis of two distinct and consecutive phases (i.e. testing and development). In testing, ABO compatibility is assessed after classifying donors into the four blood types, namely, A, B, AB and O, to indicate the suitability and safety of plasma for administration in order to refine the CP tested list repository. The development phase includes patient and donor sides. In the patient side, prioritisation is performed using a contracted patient decision matrix constructed between ‘serological/protein biomarkers and the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fractional inspired oxygen criteria’ and ‘patient list based on novel MCDM method known as subjective and objective decision by opinion score method’. Then, the patients with the most urgent need are classified into the four blood types and matched with a tested CP list from the test phase in the donor side. Thereafter, the prioritisation of CP tested list is performed using the contracted CP decision matrix.
Result
An intelligence-integrated concept is proposed to identify the most appropriate CP for corresponding prioritised patients with COVID-19 to help doctors hasten treatments.
Discussion
The proposed framework implies the benefits of providing effective care and prevention of the extremely rapidly spreading COVID-19 from affecting patients and the medical sector.

AB  - Early diagnosis is still the most important factor to deal with skin cancer, a disease that challenges physicians and researchers. It has benefited from computer-aided diagnosis methods that successfully combine dermoscopy, Digital Image Processing, and Machine Learning techniques. This paper aims to approximate medical professionals working with dermoscopy to these methods, to join the challenge of melanoma early detection. Accordingly, a proposal for extracting, selecting and combining texture and shape features from dermoscopic images is presented. The Feature Selection task is added to the learning process to potentiate the quality of classification models. Three classical Machine Learning algorithms were applied to differentiate melanoma from non-melanoma images. The models are evaluated by standard performance measures and a multi-criteria decision analysis method. This is the first time such method is used in melanoma diagnosis. As a result, we found a decision tree that performs well and allows the explicit representation and analysis of the knowledge learned from the images. In addition, the competitiveness of our decision models in comparison with literature approaches reviewed in this work encourages further applications of Machine Learning and Feature Selection to assist computer-aided diagnosis.

Drawing on a rich data set obtained from selected case study firms in Pakistan, three MCDM tools, namely, intuitionistic fuzzy decision-making trial and evolution laboratory (IF-DEMATEL), analytic network process (ANP), and simple additive weighting (SAW), are employed to assess the relative importance of BDA capabilities and the relationship of these capabilities with the firm performance. The results show that BDA capabilities are interdependent, and infrastructure capabilities are the highest-ranked among all, followed by management and human resource capabilities, respectively. The SAW results indicate an association between BDA capabilities and firm performance. Moreover, BDA capabilities are more strongly related to operational performance than to market performance.

AB  - Floods are one of the most widespread natural hazards occurring across the globe. The main objective of this study was to produce flood susceptibility maps for the province of Salzburg, Austria, using two multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) models including analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and analytical network process (ANP) and two machine learning (ML) models including random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). Additionally, we compare which of the MCDA and ML models are better suited for flood susceptibility and evaluate the use of Dempster Shafer Theory (DST) for optimising the resulting flood susceptibility maps based on eleven flood conditioning factors: elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), geology, rainfall, land cover, distance to roads and distance to drainage. The accuracy evaluation of the flood susceptibility maps through the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) method along with the relative flood density (R-Index) shows that RF (AUC = 87.8%) and SVM (AUC = 87%) outperform the ANP (AUC = 86.6%) and AHP (AUC = 85.9%) models. Therefore, the predictive performance of ML models was slightly better than the MCDA models. The DST could further increase the accuracy of both ML models (AUC = 88.3%) and MCDA models (AUC = 87.3%). However, the best accuracy (AUC = 89.3%) is reached through an ensemble of all four models.

AB  - Economic, social and environmental requirements make planning for a sustainable electricity generation mix a demanding endeavour. Technological innovation offers a range of renewable generation and energy management options which require fine tuning and accurate control to be successful, which calls for the use of large-scale, detailed datasets. In this paper, we focus on the UK and use Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to evaluate electricity generation options against technical, environmental and social criteria. Data incompleteness and redundancy, usual in large-scale datasets, as well as expert opinion ambiguity are dealt with using a comprehensive grey TOPSIS model. We used evaluation scores to develop a multi-objective optimization model to maximize the technical, environmental and social utility of the electricity generation mix and to enable a larger role for innovative technologies. Demand uncertainty was handled with an interval range and we developed our problem with multi-objective grey linear programming (MOGLP). Solving the mathematical model provided us with the electricity generation mix for every 5 min of the period under study. Our results indicate that nuclear and renewable energy options, specifically wind, solar, and hydro, but not biomass energy, perform better against all criteria indicating that interindustry architectural innovation in the power generation mix is key to sustainable UK electricity production and supply.

AB  - This study proposes a novel decision support system for product ranking problems which integrates multi criteria decision making (MCDM) and aspect level sentiment analysis techniques. The main purpose of the developed methodology is to rank the alternative products taking into account a set of product criteria and the customer comments related to these criteria posted on websites to recommend the most appropriate alternative to potential customers. The decision support system comprises two stages, in the first stage, the online customer reviews are transformed into customer satisfaction scores through aspect level sentiment analysis to obtain performance scores corresponding to alternative products, whereas the second stage deals with ranking the alternative products via a novel MCDM methodology, namely “IF-ELECTRE integrated with VIKOR” according to the performance scores obtained in the first level. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) are utilized to effectively represent the customer reviews including hesitant expressions in decision matrix. The weights of criteria (the product aspects of significant importance for customers) are determined using entropy method. The applicability of the developed approach is explored by a case study, in which customer reviews about hotel experiences are evaluated using lexicon based sentiment analysis and alternative hotels are ranked according to the findings from the sentiment analysis by the Intuitionistic fuzzy (IF)-ELECTRE integrated with VIKOR methodology.

AB  - Growing world population along with fast economic growth and increased living standards have increased the municipal waste generation making its management be a foremost global issue. The problem is even more serious in urban areas as its improper management prompts tainting of soil, water, and environment which create public health risks. These problems of waste disposal and management were usually assessed by traditional methods which require loads of data. The recent development in the new software technologies and Internet along with the introduction of gradually more compact and dependable hardware products have presented the ability to accurately deal with these procedures more easily than costly and tedious field experiments. This paper presents an outline of the utilization of different scientific models in solving the environmental problems of municipal waste disposal. The examination of past literature uncovered that usually optimization models were used to find the answer of 'what is the best' under an explicit arrangement of conditions, while, simulation models were usually helpful to get an answer to 'what if? ' due to their predictive capability. An indication of the municipal waste disposal problems and its management alongside the ramifications of the investigation is provided. The rationale and backdrop of the waste disposal issues are described. The applications of optimization modeling, multi-objective approach, multi-criteria decision analysis, and artificial neural networks in waste management are presented and applications of these modeling techniques in diverse case studies worldwide are described. And finally, the conclusions of the analysis are summarized.

AB  - Graphical information (visualized data, information, and knowledge generated from different investigations and experimentations) is a useful form of decision-relevant information in all fields of study. The usages of such information are expected to increase exponentially due to the advent of big data. Unfortunately, there are no formal methods available for directly computing the graphical information generated from big data while making a decision. This study fills this gap and presents a fuzzy logic based method, as well as a decision support tool, to perform multiple criteria decision making by directly computing the graphical information generated from big data. The effectiveness of the proposed method and tool is demonstrated by conducting a case study. Further study can be carried out to see the implication of this study in making formal decisions aided by the big data.

This research stratifies the plithogenic multi criteria decision making (MCDM) strategy for defining the significant weights of assessing standards, and the VIKOR technique is applied for enhancing the serving efficiency classifications of the possible substitutes. An experimental issue, including 11 assessing standards, 3 private and 2 general hospitals in Zagazig, has been evaluated by 3 assessors from several areas of medical activities, asked to validate the suggested strategy. In this research, we give some definitions of the plithogenic environment, which is more general and comprehensive than fuzzy, intuitionistic fuzzy and neutrosophic ones. The plithogeny is interested in the contradiction degrees between attribute values that help in better calculating the aggregations. We conducted the data analysis and the results showed us that the serving efficiency of private medical centers is superior than that of general medical centers due to the fact that public medical centers are scarcely supported by governmental institutions. The private medical centers have to ward themselves to keep possession of bringing patients or attract patients. We conducted the sensitivity analysis of the achieved results, to verify their validity, and to find out to what extent the different values affect the ranking of available alternatives.

AB  - Due to increasing public awareness, government regulation and market pressure on sustainability issues, companies have found out that in order to have a competitive edge, sustainable operational activities should be adopted with their supply chain. Sustainable supplier selection as a crucial decision can affect the overall degree of sustainability in a supply chain. In this paper, an integrated approach of clustering and multi criteria decision making methods have been proposed in order to solve sustainable supplier selection problem. Firstly, self- organizing map as one of the well-known neural network methods has been utilized in order to cluster and prequalify the suppliers based on customer demand attribute and sustainability elements. Then, multi criteria decision making methods will be utilized in order to rank the cluster of suppliers to make coordination between them and customers. A case study has been carried out in order to show the efficiency of proposed approach.

AB  - Concurrent with global economic development in the last 50 years, the opportunities for the spread of existing diseases and emergence of new infectious pathogens, have increased substantially. The activities associated with the enormously intensified global connectivity have resulted in large amounts of data being generated, which in turn provides opportunities for generating knowledge that will allow more effective management of animal and human health risks. This so-called Big Data has, more recently, been accompanied by the Internet of Things which highlights the increasing presence of a wide range of sensors, interconnected via the Internet. Analysis of this data needs to exploit its complexity, accommodate variation in data quality and should take advantage of its spatial and temporal dimensions, where available. Apart from the development of hardware technologies and networking/communication infrastructure, it is necessary to develop appropriate data management tools that make this data accessible for analysis. This includes relational databases, geographical information systems and most recently, cloud-based data storage such as Hadoop distributed file systems. While the development in analytical methodologies has not quite caught up with the data deluge, important advances have been made in a number of areas, including spatial and temporal data analysis where the spectrum of analytical methods ranges from visualisation and exploratory analysis, to modelling. While there used to be a primary focus on statistical science in terms of methodological development for data analysis, the newly emerged discipline of data science is a reflection of the challenges presented by the need to integrate diverse data sources and exploit them using novel data- and knowledge-driven modelling methods while simultaneously recognising the value of quantitative as well as qualitative analytical approaches. Machine learning regression methods, which are more robust and can handle large datasets faster than classical regression approaches, are now also used to analyse spatial and spatio-temporal data. Multi-criteria decision analysis methods have gained greater acceptance, due in part, to the need to increasingly combine data from diverse sources including published scientific information and expert opinion in an attempt to fill important knowledge gaps. The opportunities for more effective prevention, detection and control of animal health threats arising from these developments are immense, but not without risks given the different types, and much higher frequency, of biases associated with these data.

AB  - Choosing the appropriate forecasting technique to employ is a challenging issue and requires a comprehensive analysis of empirical results. Recent research findings reveal that the performance evaluation of forecasting models depends on the accuracy measures adopted. Some methods indicate superior performance when error based metrics are used, while others perform better when precision values are adopted as accuracy measures. As scholars tend to use a smaller subset of accuracy metrics to assess the performance of forecasting models, there is a need for a concept of multiple accuracy dimensions to assure the robustness of evaluation. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to propose a decision making model that allows researchers to identify the superiority of a forecasting technique over another by considering several accuracy metrics concurrently. A multi-criteria decision analysis approach, namely the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE), was adopted to solve this problem. Bayesian Networks, Artificial Neural Networks, SVMs, Logistic Regression, and several Rule and Tree-based forecasting approaches were included in the analysis. After introducing a detailed description of accuracy measures, the performance of the prediction models are evaluated using a chosen dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

AB  - The decision to install a particular type of green roof (GR) should be made during the design stage of a project due to the different costs and benefits each GR type offers. Although much research has been conducted into the various types of GR, there is a gap in our understanding of the process of decision-making during the selection of a GR type. This paper aims to develop a decision support system (DSS) for selecting the optimum type of GR for residential buildings in Kuala Lumpur. The decision criteria were initially determined using fuzzy Delphi method, followed by the creation of a database based on expert opinions, where the experts met certain criteria regarding their expertise in this field. For data analysis, a cybernetic fuzzy analytic network process was employed as a hybrid method that ignores the least important criteria in selecting the optimum type of GR for a building. Three examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of this prototype DSS in detail. Finally, it was concluded that the prototype DSS automates the entire process of GR type selection. Moreover, it enables decision-makers to select the most suitable alternative considering all significant financial and non-financial decision criteria.

AB  - In the last few years, machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to solve engineering problems. However, owing to certain complexities found in real-world problems, such as class imbalance, classical learning algorithms may not reach a prescribed performance. There can be situations where a good result on different conflicting objectives is desirable, such as true positive and true negative ratios, or it is important to balance model’s complexity and prediction score. To solve such issues, the application of multi-objective optimization design procedures can be used to analyze various trade-offs and build more robust machine learning models. Thus, the creation of ensembles of predictive models using such procedures is addressed in this work. First, a set of diverse predictive models is built by employing a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Next, a second multi-objective optimization step selects the previous models as ensemble members, resulting on several non-dominated solutions. A final multi-criteria decision making stage is applied to rank and visualize the resulting ensembles. To analyze the proposed methodology, two different experiments are conducted for binary classification. The first case study is a famous classification problem through which the proposed procedure is illustrated. The second one is a challenging real-world problem related to water quality monitoring, where the proposed procedure is compared to four classical ensemble learning algorithms. Results on this second experiment show that the proposed technique is able to create robust ensembles that can outperform other ensemble methods. Overall, the authors conclude that the proposed methodology for ensemble generation creates competitive models for real-world engineering problems.

AB  - Many advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning are based on decision making, especially in uncertain settings. Due to its possible applications, decision making is currently a broad field of study in many areas like Computation, Economics and Business Management. The first techniques appeared in scenarios where information was modeled by real numbers. In all cases, one of the key steps in such processes was the summarization of the available information into a few values that helped the decision maker to complete this task. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-criteria decision making methodology in the fuzzy context in which weights and experts’ opinions (may be translated by linguistic labels) are stated as triangular fuzzy numbers. To do that, we take advantage of a recently presented fuzzy binary relation whose properties are according to human intuition and we carry out a study of the main properties that an aggregation function (a mapping to sum up information) must satisfy in the fuzzy framework. The presented procedure makes a final decision based on parabolic fuzzy numbers (not triangular). And this will be shown in an illustrative example.

AB  - Wind energy installation numbers have witnessed a sharp increase in the recent past. Additionally, wind farms are seen as an effective and potent part of the interconnected power system. Significant variations in the wind speed pose a challenge for wind farm operators to provide accurate forecasts. In this manuscript, three hybrid wind farms, each comprising of wind turbines and battery energy storage systems, are located in the vicinity of each other and are assumed to deliver power to a utility grid. Fuzzy-based Multi-criteria decision-making techniques are applied to this cluster of three hybrid wind farms to determine the best strategy. Machine learning-based LSSVR method is utilized for wind speed forecasting and penalty cost estimation. Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy COPRAS evaluated and potential reversal of rankings is also explored. With a cumulative priority score of 0.4573 and 99.3 for dataset X1, both, fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy COPRAS respectively indicate that A3, that is, paying penalty for power borrowed from a neighboring wind farm is the best alternative for a hybrid wind farm. This study gives new insights into decision-making, specifically for hybrid wind farms.

AB  - Building data forecasting plays an increasingly important role in building energy savings. However, the one-fits-all model cannot satisfy all the requirements of multiple application scenarios and user preferences. Motivated by the need to bridge the research gap between different user preferences (application scenarios) and energy prediction model recommendation systems, this paper proposes a novel meta-learning strategy based on an artificial neural network recommendation system. This strategy is employed for real-time cooling loads, coefficients of performance prediction and optimal prediction model recommendations. The data set is composed of 40 cases from five factory buildings. After the predictions and recommendations are obtained for all cases, the two-stage user preferences are considered based on multi-objective decision-making algorithms. Then, a new model termed the “walking slide method”, is proposed to predict some special cases. This study shows that the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model and random forest model achieve the best prediction accuracy and the minimum computation cost separately for most cases, while the long short-term memory is the best model when considering the two criteria. The variances between the different cases lead to a lower cross-validation score (approximately 65%), but a higher success rate (over 99%) for the recommendation performance. In addition, in the more complex application scenarios, a lower prediction accuracy and recommendation success rate will be obtained. In most cases, the use of a prediction combined with a monitoring system is the best choice. Last, the reliability of the results is verified by application studies. This work provides a scientific basis for energy prediction applications based on user preferences.

AB  - The analysis and improvement of product quality for process industry is an increasing concern for academia and industry. As the outputs of a manufacturing system mainly depend on corresponding input conditions, so it is of high significance to develop an optimization scheme to actively and accurately determine operating parameters to obtain desired quality. However, the widely employed single-model modeling mode for whole production process neglects the natural characteristics within process manufacturing system such as multistage manufacturing and hysteresis. Additionally, the popular data-driven modeling techniques in current works, especially black-box machine learning models have been restricted to satisfying the requirements regarding excellent approximation capability and explicit mathematical expression simultaneously. To fill up above research gap, it is meaningful to develop a new data-driven optimization scheme in this work to effectively and accurately determine the optimum operating parameters considering the abovementioned characteristics and requirements. Firstly, two different connecting strategies are discussed to determine the more accurate and feasible quality propagation mode between adjacent stages. Then, two computational intelligence (CI) techniques, i.e., Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (MGGP) and Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm are exploited to construct correlation model with explicit mathematical expression and derive the optimal operating parameters, respectively. Afterwards, the fuzzy Multi-criteria Decision Making (FMCDM) method is further proposed to select the optimal solution from the obtained Pareto solutions sets. The application of the proposed scheme in a coal preparation process indicates that the proposed scheme is promising and competitive on prediction accuracy and optimization efficiency over baseline methods, and can significantly improve the final product quality comparing with initial parameters setting. Moreover, the feasible quality specification for intermediate product can also be obtained by our proposed scheme which is beneficial for early detection of quality abnormality and timely parameters adjustment.

AB  - New product portfolio selection is a multi-criteria decision making problem including both qualitative and quantitative criteria. Determining the exact values for these criteria is often difficult or even impossible taking into account uncertainty and complexity associated with new product development projects. To assist managers in making portfolio selection decisions, this study proposes a new project portfolio selection model that uses a fuzzy weighted average approach for ranking new product projects and artificial neural networks for estimating project performance. New product development projects are evaluated according to criteria related to marketing, project team, project performance, risk, and strategy. The use of neural networks enables more precise evaluation of project performance criteria and provides additional information in portfolio selection. A case study of the evaluation of new product projects illustrates the usefulness of the proposed approach.

AB  - The skyline query as an important aspect of big data management, has received considerable attention from the database community, due to its importance in many applications including multi-criteria decision making, preference answering, and so forth. Moreover, the uncertain data from many applications have become increasing distributed, which makes the central assembly of data at one location for storage and query infeasible and inefficient. The lack of global knowledge and the computational complexity derived from the introduction of the data uncertainty make the skyline query over distributed uncertain data extremely challenging. Although many efforts have addressed the skyline query problem over various distributed scenarios, existing studies still lack the approaches to efficiently process the query. In this paper, we extensively study the distributed probabilistic skyline query problem and propose an efficient approach GDPS to address the problem with an optimized iterative feedback mechanism based on the grid summary. Furthermore, many strategies for further optimizing the query are also proposed, including the optimization strategies for the local pruning, tuple selecting and the server pruning. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data sets have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach by comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB  - Water quality assessment entails essentially a multi-criteria decision-making process accounting for qualitative and quantitative uncertainties and their transformation. Considering uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness in water quality evaluation, a cloud model-based assessment approach is proposed. The cognitive cloud model, derived from information science, can realize the transformation between qualitative concept and quantitative data, based on probability and statistics and fuzzy set theory. When applying the cloud model to practical assessment, three technical issues are considered before the development of a complete cloud model-based approach: (1) bilateral boundary formula with nonlinear boundary regression for parameter estimation, (2) hybrid entropy-analytic hierarchy process technique for calculation of weights, and (3) mean of repeated simulations for determining the degree of final certainty. The cloud model-based approach is tested by evaluating the eutrophication status of 12 typical lakes and reservoirs in China and comparing with other four methods, which are Scoring Index method, Variable Fuzzy Sets method, Hybrid Fuzzy and Optimal model, and Neural Networks method. The proposed approach yields information concerning membership for each water quality status which leads to the final status. The approach is found to be representative of other alternative methods and accurate.

AB  - Due to lucrative economics and energy policies, cogeneration systems have blossomed in many existing industries and became their backbone technology for energy generation. With ever-increasing energy demands, the required capacity of cogeneration gradually grows yearly. This situation unveils a crawling problem in the background where many existing cogeneration systems require more energy output than their allocated design capacity. To debottleneck cogeneration systems, this work extends the bottleneck tree analysis (BOTA) towards multi-dimensional problems with novel consideration of data-driven uncertainty modelling and multi-criteria planning approaches. First, cogeneration systems were modelled using an ensemble neural network with mass and energy balance to quantify the system uncertainty while assessing energy, environment, and economic indicators in the system. These indicators are then evaluated using a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method to perform bottleneck tree analysis (BOTA), which identifies optimal pathways to plan for debottlenecking projects in a multi-train cogeneration plant case study. With zero initial investment and only reinvestments with profits, the method achieved 54.2 % improvement in carbon emission per unit power production, 46.3 % improvement in operating expenditure, 59.0 % improvement in heat energy production, and 58.9 % improvement in power production with a shortest average payback period of 93.9 weeks.

AB  - Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy is administered intravenously during the treatment of breast cancer. Prior to surgery, doctors recommend chemotherapy to shrink the large size of an invasive tumor. This research work proposes a Deux Machine Learning framework, implementing a double ensemble of Machine Learning algorithms for building an optimized and efficient solution to predict a complete pathological response of patients after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy. Unlike algorithms which focus on the accuracy of prediction, the performance of the Deux Machine Learning framework is measured using a multi criteria decision-making technique known as weighted simple additive weighting (WSAW). The WSAW comprehensive performance score is calculated by considering ten evaluation metrics, namely, Accuracy, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, TP Rate, FP Rate, Precision, Recall, F-Measure, MCC, and ROC. The results are validated using the k-fold cross validation technique, achieving an accuracy of 99.08%. When the performance of the proposed framework is compared with the performance of state-of-the-art classifiers such as SVM and random forest, the results are quite promising. With the growing trend of the applications of Artificial Intelligence in Cancer research, Machine Learning has an important future in prognostication and decision-making.

AB  - This paper is motivated by decommissioning studies in the field of oil and gas, which comprise a very large number of installations and are of interest to a large number of stakeholders. Generally, the problem gives rise to complicated multi-criteria decision aid tools that rely upon the costly evaluation of multiple criteria for every piece of equipment. We propose the use of machine learning techniques to reduce the number of criteria by feature selection, thereby reducing the number of required evaluations and producing a simplified decision aid tool with no sacrifice in performance. In addition, we also propose the use of machine learning to explore the patterns of the multi-criteria decision aid tool in a training set. Hence, we predict the outcome of the analysis for the remaining pieces of equipment, effectively replacing the multi-criteria analysis by the computational intelligence acquired from running it in the training set. Computational experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - We present a method to learn the criteria weights in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) by applying emerging learning-to-rank machine learning techniques. Given the pairwise preferences by a decision maker (DM), we learn the weights that the DM attaches to the multiple criteria, characterizing each alternative. As the training information, our method requires the pairwise preferences of alternatives, as revealed by the DM. Once, the DM’s decision model is learnt in terms of the criteria weights, it can be applied to predict his choices for any new set of alternatives. The empirical validation of the proposed approach is done on a collection of 12 standard datasets. The accuracy values are compared with those obtained for the state-of-the-art methods such as ranking-SVM and TOPSIS.

AB  - In this study, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is used for multi-criteria decision making in supplier evaluation and selection problem. The contemporary supply-chain management is looking for both quantitative and qualitative measures other than just getting the lowest price. After evaluating a number of distinct suppliers, determining the reliable suppliers by ANFIS model with better approximation will support decision makers. To this end, ANFIS is evaluated for different data sets with the attributes of the suppliers and their scores that are gathered from a previous study conducted for the same problem under the name of Neural Network (NN) application for fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making model. In the proposed ANFIS model built for determining supplier score, linear regression analysis (R-value) and Mean Square Error (MSE) were 0.8467 and 0.0134, respectively, while they were 0.7733 and 0.0193 for NN for fuzzy. ANFIS gives better results according to MSEs. Hence, it is determined that ANFIS algorithm can be used in multi-criteria decision making problems for supplier evaluation and selection with more precise and reliable results.

AB  - The effect of online reviews on resulting decisions attracted the interests of merchants and researchers in different fields. According to existing studies, the decisions of tourists are highly likely modified after browsing online reviews from other travelers on a tourism website. The manner in which online reviews on tourism websites are utilized to select hotels and support tourists is a noteworthy research problem. Online reviews of a hotel are provided by various tourists with respect to different criteria; thus, each tourist is regarded as a decision-maker. In this instance, the problem of hotel selection is based on online reviews in a tourism website and is expressed as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. In this study, a mathematical model was designed to select appropriate hotels on websites. First, a new comparison method for linguistic distribution assessments was proposed based on linguistic scale functions. Second, a novel distance measurement between linguistic distribution assessments with different numbers of linguistic terms was defined with an adjustable parameter. Third, a model for calculating weights and a mathematical model were constructed according to the idea of prioritized aggregation operator and distance measurement. Finally, a case study of TripAdvisor.com was conducted to select suitable hotels using online reviews of hotels. Data analysis was completed to prove the viability of the designed model.

AB  - Hazards and disasters have always negative impacts on the way of life. Landslide is an overwhelming natural as well as man-made disaster that causes loss of natural resources and human properties throughout the world. The present study aimed to assess and compare the prediction efficiency of different models in landslide susceptibility in the Kysuca river basin, Slovakia. In this regard, the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory combining with the analytic network process (FDEMATEL-ANP), Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, and random forest (RF) classifier were considered. Initially, a landslide inventory map was produced with 2000 landslide and non-landslide points by randomly divided with a ratio of 70%:30% for training and testing respectively. The geospatial database for assessing the landslide susceptibility was generated with the help of 16 landslide conditioning factors by allowing for topographical, hydrological, lithological, and land cover factors. The ReliefF method was considered for determining the significance of selected conditioning factors and inclusion in the model building. Consequently, the landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) were generated using the FDEMATEL-ANP, Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, and random forest (RF) classifier models. Finally, the area under curve (AUC) and different arithmetic evaluation were used for validating and comparing the results and models. The results revealed that random forest (RF) classifier is a promising and optimum model for landslide susceptibility in the study area with a very high value of area under curve (AUC = 0.954), lower value of mean absolute error (MAE = 0.1238) and root mean square error (RMSE = 0.2555), and higher value of Kappa index (K = 0.8435) and overall accuracy (OAC = 92.2%).

AB  - In the present study, an optimal renewable energy management strategy (REMS) is proposed as a sustainable policy for non-fossil fuel-based centralistic energy policies. Accordingly, the demand load data and weather big datasets were analyzed using neural networks and analysis of variance, respectively. Biogas generation was modeled using a BSM2 dynamic model, and the available hydropower was evaluated in the form of a techno-economic assessment. A hybrid solar PV/wind turbine/biogas generator/hydroturbine/battery/inverter system was simulated as a gauge unit using the processed data to evaluate the potential of all renewable energies in Iran. The results were used to cluster Iran into various classes based on optimal green energy potential using a K-means algorithm. A factor analysis (FA) was performed using a big matrix consisting of 13 social, economic, environmental, and technical variables in all of Iran's provinces. Factor score coefficients were then employed in a mature multi-criteria decision making analysis technique to determine the order preference for an ideal solution (TOPSIS). These details were used to inform the REMS. The optimal hybrid renewable energy maps were generated and were combined with the FA-TOPSIS results to produce an action plan proposal. The results show that FA can explain 99% of the variance in the big data matrix. Iran can be efficiently clustered into five classes, while a four-stage action plan can assure sustainable development.

AB  - Flood is a devastating natural hazard that may cause damage to the environment infrastructure, and society. Hence, identifying the susceptible areas to flood is an important task for every country to prevent such dangerous consequences. The present study developed a framework for identifying flood-prone areas of the Topľa river basin, Slovakia using geographic information system (GIS), multi-criteria decision making approach (MCDMA), bivariate statistics (Frequency Ratio (FR), Statistical Index (SI)) and machine learning (Naïve Bayes Tree (NBT), Logistic Regression (LR)). To reach such a goal, different physical-geographical factors (criteria) were integrated and mapped. To access the relationship and interdependences among the criteria, decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP) were used. Based on the experts’ decisions, the DEMATEL-ANP model was used to compute the relative weights of different criteria and a GIS-based linear combination was performed to derive the susceptibility index. Separately, the flood susceptibility index computation through NBT-FR and NBT-SI hybrid models assumed, in the first stage, the estimation of the weight of each class/category of conditioning factor through SI and FR and the integration of these values in NBT algorithm. The application of LR stand-alone required the calculation of the weights of conditioning factors by analysing their spatial relation with the location of the historical flood events. The study revealed that very high and high flood susceptibility classes covered between 20% and 47% of the study area, respectively. The validation of results, using the past flood points, highlighted that the hybrid DEMATEL-ANP model was the most performant with an Area Under ROC curve higher than 0.97, an accuracy of 0.922 and a value of HSS of 0.844. The presented methodological approach used for the identification of flood susceptible areas can serve as an alternative for the updating of preliminary flood risk assessment based on the EU Floods Directive.

AB  - The analytic network process (ANP) is a methodology for multi-criteria decision making used to derive priorities of the compared elements in a network hierarchy, where the dependences and feedback within and between the elements can be considered. However, the ANP is limited to the input preferences as crisp judgments, which is often unfavorable in practical applications. As an extension of the ANP, a generalized analytic network process (G-ANP) is developed to allow multiple forms of preferences, such as crisp (fuzzy) judgments, interval (interval fuzzy) judgments, hesitant (hesitant fuzzy) judgments and stochastic (stochastic fuzzy) judgments. In the G-ANP, a concept of complex comparison matrices (CCMs) is developed to collect decision makers’ preferences in the multiple forms. From a stochastic point of view, we develop an eigenvector method based stochastic preference method (EVM-SPM) to derive priorities from CCMs. The main steps of the G-ANP are summarized, and the implementation of the G-ANP in Matlab and Excel environments are given in detail, which is also a prototype for a decision support system. A real-life example of the piracy risk assessment to the energy channels of China is proposed to demonstrate the G-ANP.

AB  - The Social Web promotes social interactions among people through Web 2.0 technologies. In this context, User-Generated Content (UGC) spreads across social media platforms in the absence of traditional intermediaries that can verify both the believability of the content and the reliability of the sources that generated it. For this reason, the problem of how to assess the credibility of UGC is receiving nowadays increasing attention. In the literature, several approaches have tackled this issue mainly as a classification problem, by categorizing information into genuine and fake. The majority of the proposed solutions follows a data-driven approach, by employing supervised or semi-supervised machine learning techniques that act on multiple features related to credibility. Despite its effectiveness, however, machine learning may present some possible drawbacks, including data-dependency and the possible inscrutability of the contribution that single or interacting features have in the final classification process. In this paper, a Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach is proposed, aimed to assess the credibility of UGC. A given information item (alternative) is evaluated with respect to the considered credibility features (criteria) based on prior domain knowledge, where an overall credibility estimate is obtained by means of a suitable model-driven approach based on aggregation operators. The credibility estimate allows to classify credible UGC with respect to non-credible one, and can also be used to provide a ranking of the alternatives with respect to credibility. To consider interactions among features, the Choquet integral is employed.

There are many factors influencing the development of medical tourism in developing countries. This research aims to identify those factors for medical tourism development in Malaysia. We investigate the factors from the literature to develop a new decision-making model. We use two multi-criteria decision making techniques, Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Fuzzy Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS), to reveal the interrelationships among the factors and to find the relative importance of these factors in the decision making model. The results showed that human and technological factors are the most important factors for medical tourism adoption in Malaysia. The results of this study will enable key players in the medical tourism industry to potentially assign investments for medical tourism in the developing countries.

AB  - In HVAC system design for passenger rail vehicles minimization of objectives on merchantability (initial costs), integration (equipment mass, volume), and operation (electric power demand, noise emissions) becomes increasingly important. Identification of appropriate process and component design parameters is a significant engineering challenge, particularly for emerging R744 (CO2) refrigerant cycles. In this work the sizes of the compressor, evaporator, gas cooler, cooler fan, and internal heat exchanger, plus the high pressure level and the cooler air flow rate of an R744 cycle were subject to multi-objective genetic optimization. Computationally inexpensive artificial neural networks were used as interface between different computation tools. As a result a set of Pareto-optimal R744 cycles was obtained to support the design engineer. For minimum volume and mass (153 l, 169 kg), total electric power demand was 9.2 kW. Vice-versa, minimum power demand (6.9 kW) yielded a large (272 l), heavy (198 kg), and expensive system.

AB  - Best Worst Method (BWM) has recently been proposed as a method for Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). Studies show that BWM compared with other methods such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), leads to lower inconsistency of the results while reducing the number of required pairwise comparisons. MCDM methods such as BWM require accurate information. However, it often happens in practice that a level of uncertainty accompanies the information. The main aim of this paper is to address this problem and provide an integration of BWM and Z-numbers, namely ZBWM. Providing BWM with Z-numbers enables the BWM method to handle the uncertainty of information of a multi-criteria decision. Additionally, the capabilities of the proposed method in the process of utilizing the linguistic information dealing with big data are highlighted. The proposed method is examined to address a supplier development problem. By experimental results, we show that ZBWM results lower inconsistency when compared with BWM. A Z-number contains subjectivity in its fuzzy part, which can be addressed in future applications of ZBWM.

AB  - Forestry science has a long tradition of studying the relationship between stand productivity and abiotic and biotic site characteristics, such as climate, topography, soil and vegetation. Many of the early site quality modelling studies related site index to environmental variables using basic statistical methods such as linear regression. Because most ecological variables show a typical non-linear course and a non-constant variance distribution, a large fraction of the variation remained unexplained by these linear models. More recently, the development of more advanced non-parametric and machine learning methods provided opportunities to overcome these limitations. Nevertheless, these methods also have drawbacks. Due to their increasing complexity they are not only more difficult to implement and interpret, but also more vulnerable to overfitting. Especially in a context of regionalisation, this may prove to be problematic. Although many non-parametric and machine learning methods are increasingly used in applications related to forest site quality assessment, their predictive performance has only been assessed for a limited number of methods and ecosystems. In this study, five different modelling techniques are compared and evaluated, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), generalized additive models (GAM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Each method is used to model site index of homogeneous stands of three important tree species of the Taurus Mountains (Turkey): Pinus brutia, Pinus nigra and Cedrus libani. Site index is related to soil, vegetation and topographical variables, which are available for 167 sample plots covering all important environmental gradients in the research area. The five techniques are compared in a multi-criteria decision analysis in which different model performance measures, ecological interpretability and user-friendliness are considered as criteria. When combining these criteria, in most cases GAM is found to outperform all other techniques for modelling site index for the three species. BRT is a good alternative in case the ecological interpretability of the technique is of higher importance. When user-friendliness is more important MLR and CART are the preferred alternatives. Despite its good predictive performance, ANN is penalized for its complex, non-transparent models and big training effort.

AB  - This article seeks to enhance multi criteria decision making by providing a scientific approach for decomposing and structuring decision problems. We propose a process, based on concept mapping, which integrates group creativity techniques, card sorting procedures, quantitative data analysis and algorithmic automatization to construct meaningful and complete hierarchies of criteria. The algorithmic aspect is covered by a newly proposed recursive cluster algorithm, which automatically generates hierarchies from card sorting data. Based on comparison with another basic algorithm and empirical engineered and real-case test data, we validate that our process efficiently produces reasonable hierarchies of descriptive elements like goal- or problem-criteria.

AB  - In this paper, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making model is presented based on a feed forward artificial neural network. This model is used to capture and represent the decision makers' preferences. The topology of the neural network model is developed to train the model. The proposed model can use historical data and update the database information for alternatives over time for future decisions. Basically, multi-criteria decision making problems are formulated, and neural network is used to learn the relation among criteria and alternatives and rank the alternatives. We do not use any utility function for the modeling; however, a unique method is proposed for eliciting the information from decision makers. The proposed model is applicable for a wide variety of multi-attribute decision making problems and can be used for future ranking or selection without managers' judgment effort. Simulation of the managers' decisions is demonstrated in detail and the design and implementation of the model are illustrated by a case study.

AB  - Background
Sleep plays an essential role in repairing and healing human mental and physical health. Developing an efficient method for scoring electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep stages is expected to help medical specialists in the early diagnosis of sleep disorders.
Method
In this paper, a novel technique is proposed for classifying sleep stages EEG signals using correlation graphs. First, each 30 s EEG segment is divided into a set of sub-segments. The dimensionality of each sub-segment is reduced by using a statistical model. Second, each EEG segment is transferred into a graph considering each sub-segment as a node in a graph, and a link between each pair of nodes is calculated based on their correlation coefficient. Graph's modularity is used as input features into an ensemble classifier.
Results
Different community detection algorithm based correlation graph are investigated to discern the most effective features to reveal the differences between EEG sleep stages. A combination of various classification techniques: a least square vector machine (LS-SVM), k-means, Naïve Bayes, Fuzzy C-means, k-nearest, and logistic regression are tested using multi criteria decision making (MCDM) to design an ensemble classifier. Based on the results of the MCDM, the best four: LS-SVM, Naïve Bayes, logistic regression and k-nearest are integrated, to finally utilise as an ensemble classifier to categorise the graph's characteristics. The results obtained from the ensemble classifier are compared with those from the individual classifiers. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state of the art of sleep stages classification. The experimental results showed that the EEG sleep classification based on correlation graphs are able to achieve better recognition results than the existing state of the art techniques.

AB  - The theories of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and fuzzy logic both aim to model human thinking. In MCDM, aggregation processes and preference modeling play the central role. This paper suggests a consistent framework for modeling human thinking by using the tools of both fields: fuzzy logical operators as well as aggregation and preference operators. In this framework, aggregation, preference, and the logical operators are described by the same unary generator function. Similarly to the implication being defined as a composition of the disjunction and the negation operator, preference operators were introduced as a composition of the aggregative operator and the negation operator. After a profound examination of the main properties of the preference operator, our main goal is the implementation into neural networks. We show how preference can be modeled by a perceptron, and illustrate the results in practical neural applications.

AB  - The main focus of this paper is to present thermodynamic and economic analyses and multi-objective optimization of a novel geothermal-solar multigeneration system. The system aims to produce hydrogen, freshwater, electricity, cooling load, and hot water and designed based on geothermal and solar energy. After modeling and thermodynamic and economic analysis, exergy destruction rate, exergy efficiency and, cost rate were calculated for each component of the system. The results showed that the highest amount of exergy destruction was related to parabolic trough collectors (PTCs) and absorption chillers. To select the geothermal fluid of the organic Rankine cycle (ORC), several different fluids were investigated, among which isobutene was selected. By using the Group method of data handling (GMDH) neural network, a mathematical relationship was obtained between the inputs and outputs of the problem and were given as inputs to the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII)alg. The final optimal point was obtained applying the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) decision criterion at which the exergy efficiency and cost rate were calculated to be 21.63% and 63.89 $/h, respectively. The meteorological data of the Zanjan, Isfahan, and Bandar Abbas cities were used to calculate the performance accurately at the TOPSIS selection point. To provide a comparison between different cities, the performance of the system was evaluated on September 17 as a sample day. On this day, the proposed system produces 26.38 kg of hydrogen and 373.8 m3 of freshwater in Isfahan.

AB  - A Dynamic Manufacturing Network (DMN) is the manufacturing industry application of the Virtual Enterprise (VE) business model based on real time information sharing and process integration. DMNs are normally formed and supported by a collaborative platform previously designed and built by a preexisting strategic partnership. The collaborative platform forms and tracks each DMN through all phases of its life cycle which leads to the accumulation and storage of large historical datasets on partner and customer characteristics and actions. This data holds the key to customer and manufacturer behavioral patterns and performances that can further be used in the decision making processes. In this study, we have focused on tackling this widely neglected research opportunity, by integrating manufacturer, order and customer data and characteristics into DMN formation and planning. The developed big data analytics approach consists of TOPSIS, fuzzy inference system and multi objective optimization techniques. Initially, by integrating the TOPSIS multi criteria decision making technique with a fuzzy inference system (FIS) we have computed indices for Manufacturer reliability and Order priority. Then we developed a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to generate efficient solutions minimizing cost and assigning more reliable manufacturers to orders with higher priority.

AB  - Controlled shot peening process is performed on two independent ways: (1) Pre-shot peening of Almen strips to determine the desired intensity (2) Shot peening of the real sample with the Almen intensity obtained. Shot peening of Almen strips in the first step takes more time. This is because, the application of input parameters, also measuring arc height and controlling the Almen intensity stages have to be completed consecutively. The results influence the real sample characteristics directly. Still, the arc height measurements and the input parameters adjustment depend on technicians’ expertness. So, numerical approaches by conducting finite element modelling (FEM), ANN (artificial neural network) and RSM (response surface methodology) takes more attention growingly. For this purpose, another numerical approach, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods have been developed and verified among their counterparts and also by comparing the experimental results, surface roughness and surface hardness in this study. The results show that the MCDM methods are consistent within themselves and in the context of input parameters (air pressure, shot size, peening duration) and output parameters (surface hardness, surface roughness). The Topsis approach presents consistent results with compared to both the other approaches and the experimental conditions.

A comprehensive review study needs to be carried out for a better understanding of sustainable manufacturing. The prime objective of the present study is to explore different insights from the past literature which can assist the better adoption of sustainable manufacturing. To explore various insights and gaps in sustainable manufacturing, 541 articles are selected from SCOPUS database (January 2001 to March 2019). The selected articles are categorized based on year, publishers, journals, the status of the country, universities, citations, manufacturing industries, research design, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques, data analysis techniques, sustainable dimensions, and focused areas. The categorization of selected articles assists in exploring various gaps such as 70.43% of the studies in the literature are focused on qualitative aspects. Most of the studies in the literature are dominated by developed countries as 63.40% of the studies are carried out in developed countries. Looking at the significant contribution in the economical development of any country, the sustainable manufacturing adoption in food (2.96%), steel (2.77%) and chemical (2.77%) industries is recorded to be limited. More sustainable solutions must be identified which can reduce negative environmental impacts of the manufacturing processes. The selection of articles for the present study is limited to SCOPUS database which is a limitation of the present study.

AB  - One of the key challenges to improving the quality of service (QoS) in integrated heterogeneous mobile Internet protocol networks is the design of an intelligent decision engine for accessing various services anywhere and at any time. The multi-criteria decision making algorithm plays a significant role in ensuring universal and seamless connection. In this study, a multi-criteria vertical handoff decision algorithm plus dwell time is developed to achieve a satisfactory quality of service using the best access network selection in an integrated wireless local area network (WLAN), a worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), and a universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS). Handoffs are divided into two schemes: the UMTS originating handoff (downward) and the WLAN/WiMAX originating handoff (upward/intrasystem). The initial criteria for real-time and non-real-time services are presented. The metrics that are required to trigger a handoff are the predictive received signal strength (PRSS) of neighbor networks and the received signal strength obtained from the current network. The back propagation neural network is learned for the prediction. The dwell time is used as a counter to avoid the unnecessary handoffs that may occur in the overlapping areas. The quantitative network selection is the largest merit value and is based on the available bandwidth, cost, user preference, and the criteria to eliminate inappropriate candidate networks. The importance of using the PRSS, dwell time, and merit function is evaluated. To illustrate the QoS satisfaction, the multi-criteria vertical handoff decision algorithm outperforms the single-criteria using the hysteresis and Mamdani fuzzy method.

AB  - The wide spread of internet resources has emerged new paradigms of learning and knowledge delivery to facilitate and enhance learning particularly in e-learning systems. The important milestones of these new paradigms are known as digital learning objects (DLO) which are smallest packed bits for learning. The abundance of these DLOs raises an important question on how to select effectively high quality reusable learning objects. There exist many soft computing approaches such as; fuzzy computing, neural networks, evolutionary computing, support vector machines, machine learning and probabilistic reasoning. In this paper, fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods in choosing suitable DLOs were reviewed. This paper discusses recent variety of soft computing methods used in selecting and evaluating digital learning objects through multi criteria decision analysis approaches used; for selecting metrics like basic topical, course similarity, internal topical, basic and user similarity personal, and context similarity situational relevance and for evaluation; scalarization method, employing triangular, trapezoidal and distance based similarity (adapted from TOPSIS techniques). As DLOs continue to evolve it is inevitable to utilize multi-criteria techniques for selecting and or improving quality. The abundance of DLOs has increased the need for applying practical soft computing techniques to retrieve high quality, reusable DLOs.

AB  - The publication indicator of the Finnish research funding system is based on a manual ranking of scholarly publication channels. These ranks, which represent the evaluated quality of the channels, are continuously kept up to date and thoroughly reevaluated every four years by groups of nominated scholars belonging to different disciplinary panels. This expert-based decision-making process is informed by available citation-based metrics and other relevant metadata characterizing the publication channels. The purpose of this paper is to introduce various approaches that can explain the basis and evolution of the quality of publication channels, i.e., ranks. This is important for the academic community, whose research work is being governed using the system. Data-based models that, with sufficient accuracy, explain the level of or changes in ranks provide assistance to the panels in their multi-objective decision making, thus suggesting and supporting the need to use more cost-effective, automated ranking mechanisms. The analysis relies on novel advances in machine learning systems for classification and predictive analysis, with special emphasis on local and global feature importance techniques.

AB  - Within procurement literature; many studies focus on providing decision support to the supplier selection problem. However, studies on group decision support are yet to be explored extensively within supplier selection literature, despite its benefits. This study presents the application of a hybrid approach for group decision support for the supplier selection problem. fuzzy set theory, analytic hierarchy process and neural networks have been integrated to provide group decision support under consensus achievement. Discriminant analysis has been used for the purpose of supplier base rationalization, through which suppliers have been mapped to highly suitable and less suitable supplier classes. The proposed integrated approach has been further studied through two case studies and the proposed approach has been compared with another approach for group decision making under consensus and other approaches for prioritization using AHP, without consensus achievement. A very high accuracy in capturing the collective consensual preferences of the group was established across eight cross-validation tests from the two case studies, for the hybrid approach, even with extremely limited count of data sets which were used for training the hybrid model.

To overcome this issue, this study extends the application of the expert system to corporate credit risk and distress prediction through proposing a Multi-criteria Decision Aid (MCDA), namely PROMETHEE II, which provides a multi-criteria evaluation of competing DPMs. In addition, using data on Chinese firms listed on Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, we perform an exhaustive comparative analysis of the most popular DPMs; namely, statistical, artificial intelligence and machine learning models under both mono-criterion and multi-criteria frameworks. Further, we address two prevailing research questions; namely, "which DPM performs better in predicting distress?" and "will training models with corporate governance indicators (CGIs) enhance the performance of models?”; and discuss our findings. Our multi-criteria ranking suggests that non-parametric DPMs outperform parametric ones, where random forest and bagging CART are among the best machine learning DPMs. Further, models fed with CGIs as features outperform those fed without CGIs.

AB  - The contamination of waters by persistent organic pollutants, especially pharmaceutical contaminants, is one of the concerns all over the world. To date, among the treatment methods, the efficient EAOPs method have shown a high ability to treat this type of pollutant. However, conducting adequate tests for taking into account almost all possible conditions to predict the amount of pollutant removal in different conditions is still a challenge. On the other hand, achieving this aim requires a lot of cost and time. The superiority of data mining based methods over conventional mathematical methods have made these methods a good solution to solve this problem. Hence, in present study a model by employing data mining algorithms includes Artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), M5 model tree, least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) and hybrid of LSSVM and firefly optimization algorithm (FFA), scatter interpolation method, and multi-criteria decision making, namely DID, is presented for modeling of drugs removal. For this purpose, four different inputs include current density, electrolyte concentration, pH, and electrolysis time are used for electrochemical removal of Ciprofloxacin (CIP) as a model pollutant. Subsequently, Scatter interpolation method is used for generating enough data for more accurate modeling and more reliable results. In the final part of the survey, the TOPSIS method under six scenario, is employed for ranking of algorithms by considering accuracy and time criteria. In defined scenarios for TOPSIS, six different weights are considered for time criteria as well as the weights of accuracy are considered as equal in each scenario. Also, the sum of scores of each algorithm in all scenarios is used for final decision. The finding results by TOPSIS for original data showed the superiority of LSSVM_FFA. After generating new data, the M5 and the ANFIS have better results in 0.25 time weight. However, by decreasing time weight and increasing accuracy weight (after second scenario), the M5 and the LSSVM_FFA have better results. Besides, based on the sum of scores for new data, the M5 and the LSSVM_FFA have superiority. Finally, it can be concluded that M5 in about to 3 s, and LSSVM_FFA in about to 17 s lead to estimate the drug removal value with good accuracy, and without needing to high cost, and several months laboratory works. Therefore, the mentioned models can be used for different tasks, such as determining the optimal removal of drug, and investigating the impact of different parameters on drug removal process, without needing to each special experiment. Thus, for generating the large data set, the results of the present study are reliable.

AB  - As a major priority to get better resource utilization and to ensure a high quality of life, research on smart disaster response systems (smart DRS) that based on information and communication technology (ICT) has been widespread. It’s imperative for smart cities to have smart disaster response systems so they can easily manage natural disasters efficiently such as tsunamis, earthquakes, and hurricanes. Lately, the Internet of Things (IoT) provided several solutions to confront the disaster concerns such as early cautions, remote controlling, data analysis and knowledge building. To evaluate the performance of the smart disaster response systems, there are a group of criteria that need to be measured. This study proposed an integrated framework to evaluate the performance of smart disaster response systems under uncertainty. Due to ensure a more accurate evaluation process, the proposed framework is based on plithogenic set theory that handles ambiguity and uncertainty in evaluation by considering the contradiction degree between the evaluation criteria. The problem of performance evaluation of the smart disaster response systems is formulated as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. The proposed framework is constructed using three common MCDM methods which is AHP, TOSIS, and VIKOR. Five smart disaster response systems will be evaluated in order to improve the reliability of the proposed framework.

AB  - Classification of wine represents a multi-criteria decision-making problem characterized by great complexity, non-linearity and lack of objective information regarding the quality of the desired final product. Volatile compounds of wines elaborated from four Galician (NW Spain) autochthonous white Vitis vinifera from four consecutive vintages were analysed by gas chromatography (FID, FPD and MS detectors), and several aroma compounds were used for correctly classifying autochthonous white grape varieties (Albariño, Treixadura, Loureira and Dona Branca). The objective of the work is twofold: to find a classification model able to precisely differentiate between existing grape varieties (i.e. assuring the authenticity), and to assess the discriminatory power of different family compounds over well-known classifiers (i.e. guaranteeing the typicality). From the experiments carried out, and given the fact that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was not able to accurately separate all the wine varieties, this work investigates the suitability of applying different machine learning (ML) techniques (i.e.: Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, MultiLayer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbour and Naïve Bayes) for classification purposes. Perfect classification accuracy is obtained by the Random Forest algorithm, whilst the other alternatives achieved promising results using only part of the available information.

AB  - The quality of data analysis and modeling is dependent on its inputs and statistical analysis is of limited value with inappropriate data. This paper proposes a framework for assessing data quality using the example of airport surface safety, i.e. runway/taxiway safety. The nature of airport surface safety is such that there is a need to account for data from a number of stakeholders, who may possess databases differing in quality, and aggregate this data for subsequent analysis to provide robust safety assessment and mitigation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a framework for the validation of external data quality based on the underlying data collection and investigation processes. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) using a linear model is applied to derive quantitative weights for twelve safety databases based on the quality of the underlying organizational data collection and investigation processes. The model takes eleven criteria in relation to possible error sources during data gathering and pre-processing, organizational safety culture, data accessibility, and the consistency of the reporting system over time into account. These weights combined with an internal data quality validation and an indication of the reporting level of an organization can give a robust indication of the quality of a database. This method is recommended for use for data quality assessments in aviation safety.

AB  - Detection of size, shape and color of minerals are important for obtaining information about minerals. The output of mines is ores which vary in colors and shapes. The multiplicity of ores, large scale features and the importance of speeding up the mineral type detection process for intelligent systems, leads us to rely more on expert's advice and rank the selected available features for type detection, according to their importance. In this paper, to separate different ores and gangue minerals, image processing and computer vision techniques with combination of multi criteria decision making (MCDM) approach are applied. Our method proposes a novel way which combines the image processing techniques and artificial neural networks, with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approaches to detect different types of ores. By help of experts in feature ranking, the image processing techniques proved to be more effective and prompt. The final results show that the proposed method is more successful in type detection of minerals than the other image processing techniques for ores type detection. Our method is also applicable for real-time systems to estimate minerals at on-line ore sorting and classification stages.

AB  - Copper alloys with high strength and electrical conductivity are ideal candidates for a wide range of civilian and engineering applications. Traditional methods of alloy design, such as “trial and error” experiments, are costly and time-consuming, limiting the discovery of Cu alloys. Machine learning (ML)-based technology facilitates a better understanding on inter-relationships within massive experimental datasets, and shortens the development cycle of new alloy systems. Herein, we propose a method of material design based on ML to discover high-performance Cu alloys. The ML models are trained from “discarded” experimental data that show undesirable hardness and/or electrical conductivity. We constructed effective Gaussian process regression-based models successfully from limited training data by engaging additional features. The predicted Cu alloys were experimentally synthesized and characterized, exhibiting superior hardness or electrical conductivity with respect to original training data. The increase of hardness is due to precipitation of second-phase Co-Ti and Fe-Ti compounds during aging, while the rise of electrical conductivity is caused by a purification effect of the precipitates on Cu matrix. The impact of physical features on ML models was further evaluated by a genetic algorithm. Our findings suggest that ML holds great potential for developing high-performance Cu alloys.

AB  - Supplier selection is a critical multi-criteria decision making problem for supply chain management. With the emergence of big data, there is an urgent need for data-driven decision making methods. A hybrid DEA-Adaboost model is proposed to meet the challenge. The proposed model is split into the DEA and the learner. The fuzzy multi-objective DEA is used to build the expert database, which contains the appropriate and inappropriate suppliers. The learner is trained by Adaboost from the expert database. Thus, the DEA and derived learner are combined as the hybrid model to reduce the time consumption and computational complexities for suppliers selection. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model improves the accuracy compared with other two approaches.

AB  - Existing Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) based communication suffers from various security and performance issues, hence Cluster based Communication is preferred nowadays. However, Cluster based Communication adds extra overhead and burden on the Cluster Head (CH) in dense network scenarios which eventually introduces delay and hinders network performance. To reduce the overburdening of single CH, a multi cluster head scheme is proposed in which multiple nodes in a cluster can act as CH to share the load of single CH. For a selection of stable CH, Hybrid Fuzzy Multi-criteria Decision making approach (HF-MCDM) is proposed in which Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and TOPSIS methods are clubbed together for optimal decision making. Further because of association of Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) with life-critical applications, there is a dire need for a security framework to detect various malevolent attacks. Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) like Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the approaches for curbing such attacks. These intrusion detection based mechanism can be combined with various existing optimization techniques to improve their performance, and Dolphin Swarm Algorithm is one such approach. Dolphins have many significant biological features like echolocation, exchange of information, coordination, and division of labor. These biological features combined with swarm intelligence can be utilized for optimizing the detection and accuracy of SVM based IDS. So in this paper, a Multi-Cluster Head anomaly based IDS optimized by Dolphin Swarm Algorithm has been proposed and its results are compared with various existing Security frameworks in terms of parameters like false positive, detection rate, detection time, etc. and it is observed that the proposed approach performs better.

AB  - Objective
To integrate multiple sources of clinical information with patient feedback to build evidence-based decision support model to facilitate treatment selection for patients suffering from vestibular schwannomas (VS).
Methods
This was a mixed methods study utilizing focus group and survey methodology to solicit feedback on factors important for making treatment decisions among patients. Two 90-minute focus groups were conducted by an experienced facilitator. Previously diagnosed VS patients were recruited by clinical investigators at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). Classical content analysis was used for focus group data analysis. Providers were recruited from practices within the UPMC system and were surveyed using Delphi methods. This information can provide a basis for multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework to develop a treatment decision support system for patients with VS.
Results
Eight themes were derived from these data (focus group + surveys): doctor/health care system, side effects, effectiveness of treatment, anxiety, mortality, family/other people, quality of life, and post-operative symptoms. These data, as well as feedback from physicians were utilized in building a multi-criteria decision model.
Discussion
The study illustrated steps involved in the development of a decision support model that integrates evidence-based data and patient values to select treatment alternatives.
Conclusions
Studies focusing on the actual development of the decision support technology for this group of patients are needed, as decisions are highly multifactorial. Such tools have the potential to improve decision making for complex medical problems with alternate treatment pathways.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop a hybrid methodology that integrates machine learning algorithms with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques to effectively conduct multi-attribute inventory analysis. In the proposed methodology, first, ABC analyses using three different MCDM methods (i.e. simple-additive weighting, analytical hierarchy process, and VIKOR) are employed to determine the appropriate class for each of the inventory items. Following this, naïve Bayes, Bayesian network, artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are implemented to predict classes of initially determined stock items. Finally, the detailed prediction performance metrics of algorithms for each method are determined. The comprehensive case study executed at a large-scale automotive company revealed that the best classification accuracy is achieved by SVMs. The results also revealed that Bayesian networks, SVMs and ANNs are all capable of successfully dealing with the unbalanced data problems associated with Pareto distribution, and each of these algorithms performed well against all examined measures, thus validating the fact that machine learning algorithms are highly applicable to inventory classification problems. Therefore, this study presents uniqueness in that it is the first and foremost of its kind to effectively combine MCDM methods with machine learning algorithms in multi-attribute inventory classification and is practically applicable in various inventory settings. Furthermore, this study also provides a comprehensive chronological overview of the existing literature of machine learning methods within inventory classification problems.

AB  - Rainfall data are needed for water resource management and decision making and are obtained from rainfall networks. These data are especially important for streamflow simulations and forecasting the occurrence of intense rainfall during the flood season. Therefore, rainfall networks should be carefully designed and evaluated. Several methods are used for rainfall network design, and information theory-based methods have recently received significant attention. This study focuses on the design of a rainfall network, especially for streamflow simulation. A multi-objective design method is proposed and applied to the Wei River basin in China. We use the total correlation as an indicator of information redundancy and multivariate transinformation as an indicator of information transfer. Information redundancy refers to the overlap of information between rainfall stations, and information transfer refers to the rainfall-runoff relationship. The outlet streamflow station (Huaxian station in the Wei River basin) is used as the target station for the streamflow simulation. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA‐II) was used for the multi-objective optimization of the rainfall network design. We compared the proposed multi-objective design with two other methods using an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The optimized rainfall network from the proposed method led to reasonable outlet streamflow forecasts with a balance between network efficiency and streamflow simulation. Our results indicate that the multi-objective strategy provides an effective design by which the rainfall network can consider the rainfall-runoff process and benefit streamflow prediction on a catchment scale.

AB  - This study presents a novel framework to optimize Low Impact Development (LID) practices for urban storm water management. First, the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) model was executed for different possible scenarios of input parameters and various LIDs to simulate runoff volume, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) loads. Next, a neural network (MLP-ANN) was trained and validated, as a surrogate model, against the set of inputs and output variables from the SWMM model simulations. The inherent uncertainties in the rainfall-runoff modeling were accounted for using a Nonlinear Interval Number Programming (NINP) model, and stakeholders' interactions are considered using a leader-follower game model. Velenjak urban watershed in Tehran, Iran, with four key stakeholders was considered as the study area. Tehran Municipality is the financial service provider that makes the first decision the leader-follower structure, and is considered as the leader with the priority of minimizing LIDs’ construction and maintenance costs. Tehran Department of Environmental Protection, Tehran Regional Water company, and Tehran Province Water and Wastewater company are the main followers in the decision making structure in the study area. This game theoretical framework yields several Pareto optimal solutions given the conflicting utilities of various players, and a Multi Criteria Decision Making procedure – i.e. PROMETHEE model – selects the most preferred compromised option. Fourteen weighting scenarios were considered in the PROMETHEE model to determine the compromise solution among the 52 solutions on the trade-off curve. The novelty of this study lies in using a nonlinear interval conflict resolution multi-objective optimization model for urban storm water management based on a leader-follower game. The proposed methodology warrants BOD and TSS loads, as well as storm water volume, are all reduced, with the highest reductions of 93, 86 and 90 percent, respectively. Results testify to the efficacy of the proposed model for urban storm water management.

AB  - The popularity of business intelligence (BI) systems to support business analytics has tremendously increased in the last decade. The determination of data items that should be stored in the BI system is vital to ensure the success of an organisation's business analytic strategy. Expanding conventional BI systems often leads to high costs of internally generating, cleansing and maintaining new data items whilst the additional data storage costs are in many cases of minor concern – what is a conceptual difference to big data systems. Thus, potential additional insights resulting from a new data item in the BI system need to be balanced with the often high costs of data creation. While the literature acknowledges this decision problem, no model-based approach to inform this decision has hitherto been proposed. The present research describes a prescriptive framework to prioritise data items for business analytics and applies it to human resources. To achieve this goal, the proposed framework captures core business activities in a comprehensive process map and assesses their relative importance and possible data support with multi-criteria decision analysis.

AB  - Sustainable urban surface runoff management is receiving increased attention due to environmental and ecological consequences related to urbanization. This study presents a useful new framework for green infrastructure (GI) planning for the management of urban runoff quality and quantity. The proposed framework considers physical, technical, economic, and multi-stakeholder aspects related to urban runoff management while simultaneously addressing the uncertainties of the decision-making process and model parameters. The methodology is applied to regionally locating and sizing low impact development-best management practices (LID-BMPs) while considering the hydrologic and hydraulic impacts. A decision-making multi-objective optimization framework is developed by integrating: 1) a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network founded on a Storm Water Management Model (SWMM-MLP meta-model), 2) NSGA-II multi-objective optimization, 3) fuzzy α-cut technique, and 4) a decision-making support model based on social choice theory to elicit trade-offs among system cost and LID-BMP performance indicators. The decision-making model, based on Fuzzy Social Choice (FSC) theory, is applied to simulate consensus between stakeholders for a partially cooperative group decision-making problem. The proposed methodology is explored in a catchment located in the northeastern part of Tehran, Iran. Results showed that the SWMM could be effectively replaced with a MLP-based meta-model in simulation-optimization problems for urban runoff management. In the application of FSC methods, the optimal scenarios were effective in reducing the volume of urban runoff and contamination loads while maintaining the optimality of the operation costs. Considering the optimal LID scenario, a reduction of more than 99% in runoff volume and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and a decrease of more than 92% of total suspended solids (TSS), occurred for the lower bound of uncertainty (lower (left) end of the α-cut = 0.3). For the upper bound of uncertainty (upper (right) end of the α-cut level = 0.3), a maximum reduction of 57% was obtained. In applying FSC methods through the decision-making process, the Borda Counting method considered the preferences of all stakeholders best. Moreover, the proposed framework allows decision-makers to decide on the acceptability and reliability of the optimal management scenarios considering their preferences and uncertainties.

AB  - This article presents a methodology for the construction and use of metamodels with Deep Learning (DL) methods that are useful for making multi-criteria decisions in the design and optimization of one-way slabs. The main motivation behind this research has been to examine the possibilities of improving slab design by including this methodology in future tools, which is capable of calculating thousands of solutions in real time based on the designer’s specifications. The process of creating these metamodels begins by developing a database of millions of combinations of slab designs. These combinations are calculated with a heuristic algorithm that provides the following results: rigidity, deflection, cost per square meter, CO2 emissions and embodied energy. Once a database including the entire universe of possible solutions has been created, a metamodel is developed that is capable of “condensing” the implicit knowledge contained in the database. This metamodel is included within a Decision Support System (DSS) that produces thousands of solutions for slabs that all comply with a range of specifications designated by the design plan. Furthermore, the methodology described herein proposes the use of Pareto-optimal solutions and graphic tools to help designers make multi-criteria decisions regarding the solutions that best fit their needs. A case study is presented to illustrate this proposal: optimizing slab design in two buildings according to technical, economic and sustainability criteria. The results indicate that the multi-criteria solutions obtained would entail a significant reduction in both emissions and embodied energy as compared to mono-criteria solutions, without significantly increasing costs.

AB  - The Choquet integral model is mainly applied to describe non-additive multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. This paper considers the Choquet integral as a classifier which deals with complicated high-dimensional data. Although previously conducted studies have investigated the problem of classification using the Choquet integral and provided corresponding models, these models usually need to estimate a large number of fuzzy measure coefficients, which are not suitable when considering real situations. Sugeno et al. proposed the hierarchical Choquet integral (HCI) model to overcome this problem. However, the HCI model requires partition information of the criteria, which often cannot be obtained practically. This paper proposes two HCI models—shallow and deep models—by employing genetic algorithms (GAs) and neural networks (NNs) to automatically construct the structure of the HCI. The results of numerical experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the existing Naïve Bayes, decision tree, and NN models.

AB  - This paper describes the development of ad hoc methodology for determination of inorganic anions in oilfield water, since their composition often significantly differs from the average (concentration of components and/or matrix). Therefore, fast and reliable method development has to be performed in order to ensure the monitoring of desired properties under new conditions. The method development was based on computer assisted multi-criteria decision making strategy. The used criteria were: maximal value of objective functions used, maximal robustness of the separation method, minimal analysis time, and maximal retention distance between two nearest components. Artificial neural networks were used for modeling of anion retention. The reliability of developed method was extensively tested by the validation of performance characteristics. Based on validation results, the developed method shows satisfactory performance characteristics, proving the successful application of computer assisted methodology in the described case study.

AB  - Floods around the world are having devastating effects on human life and property. In this paper, three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) analysis techniques (VIKOR, TOPSIS and SAW), along with two machine learning methods (NBT and NB), were tested for their ability to model flood susceptibility in one of China’s most flood-prone areas, the Ningdu Catchment. Twelve flood conditioning factors were used as input parameters: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), lithology, land use, distance from river, curvature, altitude, Stream Transport Index (STI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), soil type, slope and rainfall. The predictive capacity of the models was evaluated and validated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). While all models showed a strong flood prediction capability (AUC > 0.95), the NBT model performed best (AUC = 0.98), suggesting that, among the models studied, the NBT model is a promising tool for the assessment of flood-prone areas and can allow for proper planning and management of flood hazards.

The optimizer drives an Artificial Neural Network and a Manufacturing Time Model in a repeated analysis scheme in order to increase the combustor liner LCF life and to reduce the liner cooling system manufacturing time, simultaneously. The ANN is trained with a set of fluid/structure/lifing simulations arranged in a three-levels dataset based on a properly designed DOE approach. The CFD simulations are carried out with a reliable and robust in-house developed three-dimensional high resolution reactive viscous flow solver, accounting for conjugate heat transfer approach; the liner structural analysis is performed with a standard FEM code while the liner life assessments are obtained through an in-house developed software operating on the temperature/stress fields. Results demonstrate the validity of the overall approach in a five-dimensional state space with truly moderate computational costs.

AB  - Risk and return are interdependent in a stock portfolio. To achieve the anticipated return, comparative risk should be considered simultaneously. However, complex investment environments and dynamic change in decision making criteria complicate forecasts of risk and return for various investment objects. Additionally, investors often fail to maximize their profits because of improper capital allocation. Although stock investment involves multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), traditional MCDM theory has two shortfalls: first, it is inappropriate for decisions that evolve with a changing environment; second, weight assignments for various criteria are often oversimplified and inconsistent with actual human thinking processes. In 1965, Rechenberg proposed evolution strategies for solving optimization problems involving real number parameters and addressed several flaws in traditional algorithms, such as their use of point search only and their high probability of falling into optimal solution area. In 1992, Hillis introduced the co-evolutionary concept that the evolution of living creatures is interactive with their environments (multi-criteria) and constantly improves the survivability of their genes, which then expedites evolutionary computation. Therefore, this research aimed to solve multi-criteria decision making problems of stock trading investment by integrating evolutionary strategies into the co-evolutionary criteria evaluation model. Since co-evolution strategies are self-calibrating, criteria evaluation can be based on changes in time and environment. Such changes not only correspond with human decision making patterns (i.e., evaluation of dynamic changes in criteria), but also address the weaknesses of multi-criteria decision making (i.e., simplified assignment of weights for various criteria). Co-evolutionary evolution strategies can identify the optimal capital portfolio and can help investors maximize their returns by optimizing the preoperational allocation of limited capital. This experimental study compared general evolution strategies with artificial neural forecast model, and found that co-evolutionary evolution strategies outperform general evolution strategies and substantially outperform artificial neural forecast models. The co-evolutionary criteria evaluation model avoids the problem of oversimplified adaptive functions adopted by general algorithms and the problem of favoring weights but failing to adaptively adjust to environmental change, which is a major limitation of traditional multi-criteria decision making. Doing so allows adaptation of various criteria in response to changes in various capital allocation chromosomes. Capital allocation chromosomes in the proposed model also adapt to various criteria and evolve in ways that resemble thinking patterns.

AB  - A new reaction rate system was introduced for differential kinetic simultaneous determination of hydroquinone (HQ) and Catechol (CC). The method is based on the different kinetic behavior of HQ and CC in their reaction with iron (III) in the presence of 1, 10-phenanthroline (Phen) as a chromogenic reagent. An asymmetric double line flow injection manifold coupled with a spectrophotometric detector was designed and optimized using TOPSIS (Technique of ranking Preferences by Similarity to the Ideal Solution) methods based upon AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process). Under optimal conditions, Bayesian Regularized Artificial Neural Network (BR-ANN) trained by back-propagation of errors was utilized as a non-linear model calibration of flow injection manifold. Detection limits of 0.05 and 0.07 mg L−1 were obtained for HQ and CC, respectively. The linear dynamic range was 0.5–3.0 mg L−1 for both analytes. The suggested method was applied for simultaneous determination of HQ and CC in real samples.

Study focus
Flood is one of the most common hydrologic extremes which are frequently experienced in Mahanadi basin, India. During flood times it becomes difficult to collect information from all rain gauges. Therefore, it is important to find out key rain gauge (RG) networks capable of forecasting the flood with desired accuracy. In this paper a procedure for the design of key rain gauge network particularly important for the flood forecasting is discussed and demonstrated through a case study.
New hydrological insights for the region
This study establishes different possible key RG networks using Hall’s method, analytical hierarchical process (AHP), self organization map (SOM) and hierarchical clustering (HC) using the characteristics of each rain gauge occupied Thiessen polygon area. Efficiency of the key networks is tested by artificial neural network (ANN), Fuzzy and NAM rainfall-runoff models. Furthermore, flood forecasting has been carried out using the three most effective RG networks which uses only 7 RGs instead of 14 gauges established in the Kantamal sub-catchment, Mahanadi basin. The Fuzzy logic applied on the key RG network derived using AHP has shown the best result for flood forecasting with efficiency of 82.74% for 1-day lead period. This study demonstrates the design procedure of key RG network for effective flood forecasting particularly when there is difficulty in gathering the information from all RGs.

AB  - With developments in cloud computing and big data, the term “cloud” has become a household name owing to its characteristics of smartness and connectedness. Cloud-based platforms are associated with people. However, multi-objective decision-making problem in cloud platforms has not been extensively studied. There is no consensus on the reasonable and effective implementation of the decision-making model to select the optimum design scheme in a cloud platform and its establishment to objectively evaluate its significance. In this study, to efficiently and accurately realize the optimal selection of design scheme, a fuzzy evaluation mechanism in handling the vagueness and uncertainty is established, with the advantage of quality function deployment and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm in decision analysis. A case study is provided to validate the proposed approach in cloud platforms. To reveal the advantages of the proposed method, it was compared with other methods such as the requirement-scenario-experience evaluation framework and a rough number-based integrated method. MATLAB programming was used for this comparison and accuracy certification. The result shows that the proposed model is more efficient and dynamic and provided users with multidimensional evaluation based on open and distributed resources system.

AB  - Human factors/errors (such as inappropriate actions by operators and unsafe supervision by organizations) are a primary cause of oil spill incidents. To investigate the influences of active operational failures and unsafe latent factors in offshore oil spill accidents, an integrated human factor analysis and decision support process has been developed. The system is comprised of a Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) framework to qualitatively evaluate the influence of various factors and errors associated with the multiple operational stages considered for oil spill preparedness and response (e.g., oil spill occurrence, spill monitoring, decision making/contingency planning, and spill response); coupled with quantitative data analysis by Fuzzy Set Theory and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy-TOPSIS) to enhance decision making during response operations. The efficiency of the integrated human factor analysis and decision support system is tested with data from a case study to generate a comprehensive priority rank, a robust sensitivity analysis, and other theoretical/practical insights. The proposed approach improves our knowledge on the significance of human factors/errors on oil spill accidents and response operations; and provides an improved support tool for decision making.
