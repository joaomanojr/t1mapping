AB  - Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are becoming increasingly popular for ocean exploration, military and industrial applications. In particular, AUVs are becoming an attractive option for underwater search and survey operations as they are inexpensive compared to manned vehicles. Previous attempts on AUV designs have focused primarily on functional designs while very little research has been directed to identify optimum designs. This paper presents an optimization framework for the design of AUVs using two state-of-the-art population based optimization algorithms, namely non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and infeasibility driven evolutionary algorithm (IDEA). The framework is subsequently used to identify the optimal design of a torpedo-shaped AUV with an overall length of 1.3m. The preliminary design identified through the process of optimization is further analyzed with the help of a computer-aided design tool, CATIA to generate a detailed design. The detailed design has since then been built and is currently undergoing trials. The flexibility of the proposed framework and its ability to identify optimum preliminary designs of AUVs with different sets of user requirements are also demonstrated.

AB  - Summary
The treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has the potential to change significantly over the next few years as therapeutic regimens are rapidly evolving. However, the burden of chronic infection has not been quantified at the global level using the most recent data. Updated estimates of HCV prevalence, viremia and genotypes are critical for developing strategies to manage or eliminate HCV infection. To achieve this, a comprehensive literature search was conducted for anti-HCV prevalence, viraemic prevalence and genotypes for all countries. Studies were included based on how well they could be extrapolated to the general population, sample size and the age of the study. Available country estimates were used to develop regional and global estimates. Eighty-seven countries reported anti-HCV prevalence, while HCV viraemic rates were available for fifty-four countries. Total global viraemic HCV infections were estimated at 80 (64–103) million infections. Genotype distribution was available for ninety-eight countries. Globally, genotype 1 (G1) was the most common (46%), followed by G3 (22%), G2 (13%), and G4 (13%). In conclusion, the total number of HCV infections reported here are lower than previous estimates. The exclusion of data from earlier studies conducted at the peak of the HCV epidemic, along with adjustments for reduced prevalence among children, are likely contributors. The results highlight the need for more robust surveillance studies to quantify the HCV disease burden more accurately.

AB  - This study presents a method to identify and rank potential sites for soil and water conservation techniques. The method takes into account environmental site assessment criteria and a decision-making method known as the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Spatial data is processed by applying a geographic information system and potential sites are ranked by a multi-criteria evaluation based on meteorologic, hydrologic, topographic, agronomic and pedologic criteria. The method is applied to identify potential sites for terraces and bund systems in the Ronquillo watershed, located in the northern Andes of Peru. The analysis indicates that 44% of the catchment area of the Ronquillo River is highly suited for the implementation of terraces, and 24% of the catchment area is highly suited for the implementation of bund systems. The preliminary identification of potential sites for soil and water conservation techniques may be a useful tool in the execution of resource conservation programs.

AB  - Due to an increased awareness and significant environmental pressures from various stakeholders, companies have begun to realize the significance of incorporating green practices into their daily activities. This paper proposes a framework using Fuzzy TOPSIS to select green suppliers for a Brazilian electronics company; our framework is built on the criteria of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices. An empirical analysis is made, and the data are collected from a set of 12 available suppliers. We use a fuzzy TOPSIS approach to rank the suppliers, and the results of the proposed framework are compared with the ranks obtained by both the geometric mean and the graded mean methods of fuzzy TOPSIS methodology. Then a Spearman rank correlation coefficient is used to find the statistical difference between the ranks obtained by the three methods. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been performed to examine the influence of the preferences given by the decision makers for the chosen GSCM practices on the selection of green suppliers. Results indicate that the four dominant criteria are Commitment of senior management to GSCM; Product designs that reduce, reuse, recycle, or reclaim materials, components, or energy; Compliance with legal environmental requirements and auditing programs; and Product designs that avoid or reduce toxic or hazardous material use.

AB  - A production control system (PCS) can be considered an information-processing organization (IPO). The performance of different production control systems has been studied intensively. However, their decision-making efficiency has not drawn much attention. The amount of information in a production control system can lead to a delay in decision-making. This paper considers the effect of product position information on decision-making. We use information entropy to measure the amount of position information in products and find that there are different amounts of position information in MRP, KANBAN, and CONWIP. Then, we compare the decision-making time delay among the three production control systems across identical organizational structures for information processing. We conclude that the production control system with the smallest amount of information spends the least amount of time in decision-making.

Descriptive analytics applications center on the use of data from global positioning systems (GPSs), radio frequency identification (RFID) chips, and data-visualization tools to provide managers with real-time information regarding location and quantities of goods in the supply chain. Predictive analytics centers on demand forecasting at strategic, tactical, and operational levels, all of which drive the planning process in supply chains in terms of network design, capacity planning, production planning, and inventory management. Finally, prescriptive analytics focuses on the use of mathematical optimization and simulation techniques to provide decision-support tools built upon descriptive and predictive analytics models.

AB  - Low impact development (LID) includes strategies and practices that are designed to control surface runoff at its sources in a sustainable way. The performance of these strategies has been frequently addressed through curve number approach. This approach however subjects to a great deal of uncertainties owing to uncertain nature of curve numbers and temporal/spatial variability of flood events. This paper represents a novel methodology to deal with both inherent flood uncertainties and epistemic uncertainties identifying optimal LID strategies for flood mitigation. The proposed methodology integrates a great variety of mathematical tools including copula functions, MCS method, hydrological and hydraulic models, NSGA-II algorithm as well as ANN and fuzzy set theory. The obtained results from a case study clearly demonstrate that the proposed methodology not only presents cost-effective measures, but also can simultaneously handle both inherent and epistemic uncertainties in flood risk management.

AB  - This study develops the hybrid models of dynamic multidimensional efficiency classification. By integrating data envelopment analysis (DEA), naïve Bayesian networks (NBN) and dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN), this work proposes a five-step design for efficiency classification: (1) performance evaluation with DEA model, (2) efficiency discretization, (3) intra-period classification by NBN, (4) inter-period classification by DBN, (5) testing and validation. Due to the Markovian property of the dynamic models, the inter-period dependency is assumed invariant over time. In data-driven parameter learning, the fuzzy parameters for incorporating the variation in dynamic dependencies are introduced. We conduct an empirical case study of higher education in Taiwan to demonstrate the usability of this design.

AB  - Weighting and selection of criteria for the sustainable performance assessment of building envelope are onerous process for building designers, since the process needs to be carefully undertaken in order to adequately assess the sustainable performance of the building envelope. However, the process of selecting performance criteria and weighting the importance of these criteria for the assessment of the building envelope sustainable performance is both challenging and technically complex. A lot of multi-criteria aggregating methods have been developed, many of which require appropriate criteria and weights to evaluate sustainable performance. Some of these methods lack quantitative weighting mechanism while some lack subjective weighting mechanism. Since the weight plays a major role in ranking, assessing and selection of the sustainable envelope design, this paper presents an Integrated Criteria Weighting Framework incorporated into an Integrated Performance Model (IPM) for determining integrated weight for criteria involve in assessing the sustainable performance and selecting a sustainable envelope design. On the basis of the numerical findings, this study concludes that the proposed framework can successfully address the problem of criteria weighting and assessing the building envelope sustainable performance towards achieving building sustainability.

AB  - Many sources of fluctuation contribute to the fMRI signal, and this makes identifying the effects that are truly related to the underlying neuronal activity difficult. Independent component analysis (ICA) – one of the most widely used techniques for the exploratory analysis of fMRI data – has shown to be a powerful technique in identifying various sources of neuronally-related and artefactual fluctuation in fMRI data (both with the application of external stimuli and with the subject “at rest”). ICA decomposes fMRI data into patterns of activity (a set of spatial maps and their corresponding time series) that are statistically independent and add linearly to explain voxel-wise time series. Given the set of ICA components, if the components representing “signal” (brain activity) can be distinguished form the “noise” components (effects of motion, non-neuronal physiology, scanner artefacts and other nuisance sources), the latter can then be removed from the data, providing an effective cleanup of structured noise. Manual classification of components is labour intensive and requires expertise; hence, a fully automatic noise detection algorithm that can reliably detect various types of noise sources (in both task and resting fMRI) is desirable. In this paper, we introduce FIX (“FMRIB's ICA-based X-noiseifier”), which provides an automatic solution for denoising fMRI data via accurate classification of ICA components. For each ICA component FIX generates a large number of distinct spatial and temporal features, each describing a different aspect of the data (e.g., what proportion of temporal fluctuations are at high frequencies). The set of features is then fed into a multi-level classifier (built around several different classifiers). Once trained through the hand-classification of a sufficient number of training datasets, the classifier can then automatically classify new datasets. The noise components can then be subtracted from (or regressed out of) the original data, to provide automated cleanup. On conventional resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) single-run datasets, FIX achieved about 95% overall accuracy. On high-quality rfMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, FIX achieves over 99% classification accuracy, and as a result is being used in the default rfMRI processing pipeline for generating HCP connectomes. FIX is publicly available as a plugin for FSL.

AB  - Planning innovation orientation in public research and development (R&D) organizations presents a number of challenges exacerbated by continuous changes in citizens' social aspirations. These challenges are further amplified by the unstable and complex socio-cultural and socio-organizational characteristics of any developing economy. The paper explores and devises an adapted orientation for future innovation using a combined Delphi and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach, applied to a developing country, i.e. Thailand. A set of generic influencing factors for innovation management in public R&D, emerged from a non-country specific review, are refined by a three-round Delphi consultation involving experts from various Thai national research centers. These factors were further utilized to establish an AHP-based model applied to a Thai public R&D organization to investigate impacts of three hypothesized innovation orientations: “knowledge”, “societal” and “commercial”. The AHP-based model reveals that the “commercial orientation” has the highest impact score on innovation factors. However, a sensitivity analysis is conducted as a result of which a suggestion is made to increase the priority of collaboration-related factors to improve the impact of the “societal orientation”. The findings from the combined Delphi and AHP approach have a generic dimension that can be adapted and tested in other contexts.

AB  - Risk management and stock assessment are key methods for stock trading decisions. In this paper, we present a new stock trading method using Kansei evaluation integrated with a Self-Organizing Map model for improvement of a stock trading system. The proposed approach aims to aggregate multiple expert decisions, achieve the greatest investment returns, and reduce losses by dealing with complex situations in dynamic market environments, such as downward, upward, steady market trends, and other uncertain conditions. Kansei evaluation and fuzzy evaluation models are applied to quantify trader sensibilities about stock trading, market conditions, and stock market factors with uncertain risks. In Kansei evaluation, group psychology and sensibility of traders are quantified that represent in fuzzy weights. Kansei and stock-market data sets are visualized by SOM, together with aggregate expert preferences in order to find potential companies, matching with trading strategies at the right time and eliminating risky stocks. The proposed approach has been tested and performed well in daily stock trading on the HOSE, HNX (Vietnam), NYSE and NASDAQ (US) stock markets. The experiments through case studies show that the new approach, applying Kansei evaluation enhances the capability of investment returns and reduce losses. The experimental results also show that the proposed approach performs better than other current methods to deal with various market conditions.

AB  - It is critical for information and communications technology (ICT) companies to carry our effective power planning, in order to support the growing number of services they provide, and this traditionally relies on the tacit knowledge and experience of senior staff. The loss of such domain knowledge resulting from the retirement of staff is an important issue for organizations such as Chunghwa Telecom (CHT), the largest ICT operator in Taiwan. This study thus develops a systematic power planning model using a multi-criteria operational performance evaluation. A group version of the fuzzy repertory grid and fuzzy TOPSIS approaches is applied to elicit a set of evaluation criteria that senior staff agree on, and then the priorities of the telecom rooms are evaluated against this. In addition, a new factor, reflecting the attitudes of the decision makers with respect to the degree of strictness, is defined to determine the superiority and inferiority of each alternative compared to the others. Furthermore, a novel decision aggregation strategy regarding the degree of variation among decision makers is proposed, and a quantitative assessment is carried out to analyze its impact on the ranking results in an objective manner. The proposed model may help ICT organizations to more effectively manage their power resources, and thus obtain competitive advantages.

This study proposes a novel framework to conduct the BIA in organizations in a more systematic and comprehensive way mostly by relying on some effective multi attribute decision making (MADM) techniques. A case study in an auto part manufacturer is also provided to validate the proposed framework whose results demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the proposed approach.

This paper suggests a cross-evaluation-based weighted linear optimization (CE-WLO) model for MCIC that incorporates a cross-efficiency evaluation method into a weighted linear optimization model for finer classification (or ranking) of inventory items. The present study demonstrated the inventory-management-cost effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model using a simulation technique to conduct a comparative experiment with the previous, related investigations. We established that the proposed model enables more accurate classification of inventory items and better inventory management cost effectiveness for MCIC, specifically by mitigating the adverse effect of flexibility in the choice of weights and yielding a unique ordering of inventory items.

AB  - China's high-speed economic growth has been characterized by rapid urbanization and a series of environmental issues. This study investigates the urbanization and eco-environment system from the perspective of interactive coercing theory and proposes a new comprehensive index system for the assessment of urbanization and the eco-environment. This is done using interactive coercing model (ICM) followed by a dynamic coupling coordination degree model (DCCDM) to estimate the relationship between urbanization and the eco-environment. This study focuses on the interactive coercing relationship, coupling coordination degree and coordinated patterns in the BTH (Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei) region, China, with panel data collected from 1980 to 2011. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) demographic urbanization and eco-environmental endowment make the greatest contribution to the compound system, indicating that they are the critical factors to consider when analyzing the interactive coercing relationship between urbanization and the eco-environment; (2) we find the double-exponential curve of urbanization and the eco-environment is in the form of an inverted-U curve, and thus the Kuznets hypothesis is confirmed by the empirical analysis; and (3) the dynamic of coordination of the selected cities shows an S-shaped curve and the corresponding state of the degrees evolves into the rudimentary symbiosis phase from the harmonious development phase during rapid urbanization, and it is revealed that the coordinated patterns of most sample cities are sensitive to the eco-environment, which indicates that the urban environment is subject to great pressure. The comprehensive indexes and the interactive coupling models may help the governments better understand the complex coupling relationship, and develop sustainable urbanization development strategies that better balance urbanization and eco-environmental protection.

AB  - Developing robust policies for complex systems is a profound challenge because of their nonlinear and unpredictable nature. Dealing with these characteristics requires innovative approaches. A possible approach is to design policies that can be adapted over time in response to how the future unfolds. An essential part of adaptive policymaking is specifying under what conditions, and in which way, to adapt the policy. The performance of an adaptive policy is critically dependent on this: if the policy is adapted too late or too early, significant deterioration in policy performance can be incurred. An additional complicating factor is that in almost any policy problem, a multiplicity of divergent and potentially conflicting objectives has to be considered. In this paper we tackle both problems simultaneously through the use of multi-objective robust simulation optimization. Robust optimization helps in specifying appropriate conditions for adapting a policy, by identifying conditions that produce satisfactory results across a large ensemble of scenarios. Multi-objective optimization helps in identifying such conditions for a set of criteria, and providing insights into the tradeoffs between these criteria. Simulation is used for evaluating policy performance. This approach results in the identification of multiple alternative conditions under which to adapt a policy, rather than a single set of conditions. This creates the possibility of an informed policy debate on trade-offs. The approach is illustrated through a case study on designing a robust policy for supporting the transition toward renewable energy systems in the European Union. The results indicate that the proposed approach can be efficiently used for developing policy suggestions and for improving decision support for policymakers. By extension, it is possible to apply this methodology in dynamically complex and deeply uncertain systems such as public health, financial systems, transportation, and housing.

AB  - In pursuit of including energy performance as feedback for architects’ early stage design decision making, this research presents the theoretical foundation of a designer oriented multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) framework titled evolutionary energy performance feedback for design (EEPFD). Through a comprehensive literature review and gap analysis EEPFD is developed into an MDO methodology that provides energy performance as feedback for influencing architects’ decision making more fluidly and earlier than other approaches to date. Secondly, in response to the lack of an MDO best practice EEPFD is investigated and evaluated through two experiments. The first experiment demonstrates the ability to utilize EEPFD provided energy performance as feedback to pursue multiple architectural designs with competing objectives and tradeoffs. The second experiment identifies performance boundaries as a best practice for MDO applications to the early stage architectural design processes. The research synthesizes the results into the basis for measuring these performance boundaries as a best practice in the context where architects must gauge multiple design concepts with varying complexity coupled with performance objectives through EEPFD, thereby enhancing the influence of energy performance feedback on the early stage design process. Finally, future research into the use of performance boundaries for conceptual energy performance design exploration is discussed.

AB  - Internet of Things, by reducing or almost eliminating uncertainty regarding existence, types, conditions and remaining lives of components in an end-of-life product (EOLP), can mitigate planning of remanufacturing operations. Remaining useful life can be taken into account as a good measure of quality. Therefore, immediate determination of remaining useful life allows optimal recovery decisions to guarantee a minimum quality level on recovered products while satisfying various system criteria. In this paper, a multiple objective advanced remanufacturing-to-order and disassembly-to-order (ARTODTO) system is proposed as an order-driven component and product recovery (ODCPR) system. In ARTODTO, device embedded products are remanufactured and disassembled to meet the product and component demands, recycled to satisfy the materials demands, stored to be re-used later, or disposed of. The objective of the system is to achieve multiple conflicting financial, environmental and quality-based goals. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer goal programming model that utilizes the Internet of Things. A numerical case example is considered to illustrate its implementation.

Based on the analysis of 67 articles published within 1994–2013 period, this review reveals that 3PL selection is empirical in nature and is related to a region/country, industrial sector, and logistics activities outsourced. In terms of 3PL selection criteria, 11 key criteria are identified; each one is defined by a set of attributes. Cost is the most widely adopted criterion, followed by relationship, services, and quality. In terms of methods for 3PL evaluation, they can be categorized in 5 groups, namely: MCDM techniques, statistical approaches, artificial intelligence, mathematical programming, and hybrid methods.

AB  - Multi-Criteria Inventory Classification (MCIC) groups inventory items with respect to several criteria, in order to facilitate their management. This paper introduces a new hybrid method based on AHP and the K-means algorithm. On benchmarking data, it provides a clearly higher clustering validity index than previous sorting methods. However, as with previous methods, it is a full compensatory method. This means that an item scoring badly on one or more key criteria may still be placed in the best class because these bad scores are compensated. In order to prevent these hidden bad scores, a new variant method is introduced: AHP-K-Veto. The sorting is performed on each single criterion, where a veto system prevents an item evaluated as high/bad on at least one criterion to be top/bottom ranked in the global aggregation. This veto system is an assurance against hidden problems but slightly worsens the clustering validity index.

AB  - A supply chain network design needs to consider the future probability of reconfiguration due to some problems of disaster or price changes. The objective of this article is to design a reconfigurable supply chain network by optimizing inventory allocation and transportation routing. A two-stage programming is composed according to Benders decomposition by allocating inventory in advance and anticipating the changes of transportation routings; thus the transportation routing is stochastic in nature. In addition, the fuzzy shortest path is developed to solve the problem complexity in terms of the multi-criteria of lead time and capacity with an efficient computational method. The results and analysis indicate that the proposed two-stage programming with fuzzy shortest path surpasses the performance of shortest path problem with time windows and capacity constraint (SPPTWCC) in terms of less computational time and CPU memory consumption. Finally, management decision-making is discussed among other concluding remarks.

Relative weights for ecotourism destination criteria were obtained using the Analytic Hierarchy Process based on a survey of 777 participants. The study classified the state into five levels of naturalness with areas under Class I being the least natural and Class V being the most natural. The presence of wildlife was found to be the most important criterion and slope was found to be the least. Results also showed significant variations in visitors' preferences. Areas under Class IV and Class V in both weighted and unweighted ecotourism maps covered more than half of the state's area, suggesting high prospects for promoting forest-based ecotourism in the state. The results further showed that each class changed in size when visitors' preferences were applied. The ecotourism maps created provide useful insights for visitors, destination managers, and decision makers.

AB  - Injection molding is an ideal manufacturing process for producing high volumes of products from both thermoplastic and thermo setting materials. Nevertheless, in some cases, this type of manufacturing process decelerates the production rate as a bottleneck. Thus, layout optimization plays a crucial role in this type of problem in terms of increasing the efficiency of the production line. In this regard, a novel computer simulation–stochastic data envelopment analysis (CS-SDEA) algorithm is proposed in this paper to deal with a single row job-shop layout problem in an injection molding process. First, the system is modeled with discrete-event-simulation as a powerful tool for analyzing complex stochastic systems. Then, due to lack of information about some operational parameters, theory of uncertainty is imported to the simulation model. Finally, an output-oriented stochastic DEA model is used for ranking the outputs of simulation model. The proposed CS-SDEA algorithm is capable of modeling and optimizing non-linear, stochastic, and uncertain injection process problems. The solution quality is illustrated by an actual case study in a refrigerator manufacturing company.

AB  - In 2010, the City of Edmonton reduced the posted speed limit (PSL) in six residential communities from 50 to 40km/h. This study investigates the impact of the reduced PSL on vehicle speeds using a before-and-after experimental design with a control group adjustment. Continuous speed and traffic flow data was collected at 65 locations over a period of 7months, with the first month representing the before period and the following 6months representing the after period. Speed evaluation was performed on several levels, ranging from individual speed survey locations to an overall aggregate analysis. Several performance indicators, such as mean free-flow speed, speed variance, level of compliance, and percentile speed profile, were considered. The results revealed a statistically significant reduction in mean free-flow speed and speed variances for all combinations of time-of-day and day-of-week classifications. Though absolute compliance to the reduced PSL was low, compliance to a 15km/h threshold above the PSL was significantly high. Moreover, the analysis showed that the effectiveness of the reduced PSL improved with time.

Those preferences are essential to obtain a satisfactory accuracy in the recommendations. Preference learning is especially difficult when attributes of different kinds (numeric or linguistic) intervene in the problem, and even more when they take multiple possible values. This paper presents an approach to learn user preferences over numeric and multi-valued linguistic attributes through the analysis of the user selections. The learning algorithm has been tested with real data on restaurants, showing a very good performance.

AB  - Each core configuration of a research reactor can be optimized to provide particular or general multi-purpose irradiating conditions; specially, it includes refueling cycle length and irradiating neutron fluxes if a core management is limited to a refueling task. Each practical core or fuel management operation needs providing all of related Operational Limits and safety Conditions (OLCs). In this paper refueling cycle length and maximum irradiating thermal neutron flux are chosen as the optimizing objectives; also OLCs including total Power Peaking Factor, Shutdown Margin, Reactivity Safety Factor (RSF), and maximum permissible core excess reactivity are influenced as optimizing constraints. All parameters have been calculated accurately and benchmarked against operational parameters of a 5 MW MTR. Primary 2-D annealing process is following up to a secondary re-annealing in fine 3-D calculations. This expands global search space while the required time is reduced. Safety margins are introduced by stepwise penalty functions instead of a direct rejecting method. Results are very promising, required iterations are decreased; safety faults are automatically removed, and final results are gained near touch the infeasible frontier formed by safety margins. Refueling cycle length is significantly increased, averaged and maximum irradiating neutron fluxes are enhanced while selected OLCs are passed.

AB  - Heterogeneous Wireless Networks (HWNs) are an important step in making connectivity ubiquitous and pervasive. Leveraging the increasing variety of connectivity options available to devices solves many problems such as capacity, spectrum efficiency, coverage and reliability. Anytime decisions are made for selection, handover, scheduling or routing many performance metrics along with energy efficiency and cost for access must be considered. The increased number of choices in an HWN makes the problem more difficult than traditional homogeneous networks since each Radio Access Technology (RAT) has unique characteristics. For instance, Bluetooth networks have low range and speed but are cheap compared to 4G networks. These types of observations can be factored into decision making in HWNs. Quality of Service and Experience should be considered so that the best possible configuration of connectivity, price and user application is made. All of this should occur autonomously. This paper provides a survey of recent works in HWNs with these ideas in mind. Existing approaches are categorized by function. Limitations and strengths of solutions are highlighted and comparisons between approaches are made to provide a starting point for further research in the area.

Thirdly, studies on relative navigation are briefly reviewed, and then close-range control methods including automated control, manual control, and telecontrol are analyzed. Fourthly, advances in rendezvous trajectory safety and robust analysis are surveyed, and their applications in trajectory optimization are discussed. Finally, conclusions are drawn and prospects of studies on RODC are presented.

AB  - The difficult question of which variables to include as a minimum data set of soil quality (SQ) indicators may be simplified by statistical methods, which allow working with databases including categorical and numerical variables commonly used for assessing SQ. The aims of this study were: i) to identify soil structural related parameters that may associate to SQ at different geographic areas and ii) to test the potential power of using decision trees in setting up a framework for SQ assessment, and in determining structural soil properties, visually evaluated, that could be included in the estimation of soil physical properties such as saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks). SQ was evaluated by visual soil assessment (VSA) in the field and a limited number of physical and chemical soil properties (bulk density (BD), air capacity, plant available water capacity (PAWC), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), water stable aggregates (WSA), particle size distribution, soil organic carbon (SOC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC)) determined in the laboratory. Using categorical and numerical data of those physical, chemical and morphological properties of soils in both tropical and temperate areas, classification trees and model trees were grown. Parameters related to SQ differed between geographic areas. Ks was the strongest variable determining the SQ in ‘tropical’ soils, but WSA, SOC and PAWC were also key variables in determining differences in SQ. For ‘temperate’ soils PAWC was the only variable selected by the tree building algorithm. SOC, clay, and CEC were the discriminating variables of the model constructed from the combined data set. Statistically significant relationships between measured and visual parameters are promising in demonstrating the SQ description required for merging morphological, physical and chemical properties for minimum data set of SQ indicators. Thresholds of different predicting variables could be better established when SQ frameworks involve VSA. We also proved that prediction of KS with a model tree was more accurate when morphological parameters were included as predictor variables, and that in that case the model tree showed a simpler structure compared to the tree built only from chemical and physical soil properties. In conclusion, decision trees are encouraging in the selection of SQ indicators. Moreover, including morphological properties in the prediction of key soil properties such as Ks seems promising. VSA could render morphological response variables for predicting other soil properties and developing SQ frameworks (agricultural interest) more capable of representing structural dynamic.

The multivariate statistical techniques conducted on quarterly water consumption data in Mytilene reveal valuable tools that could help the local authorities in assigning strategies aimed at the sustainable development of urban water resources. The proposed methodology is an innovative approach, applied for the first time in the international literature, to handling urban water consumption data in order to analyze statistically the interrelationships among the determinants of urban water use. Factor analysis of demographic, socio-economic and hydrological variables shows that total water consumption in Mytilene is the combined result of increases in (a) income, (b) population, (c) connections and (d) climate parameters. On the other hand, the per connection water demand is influenced by variations in water prices but with different consequences in each consumption class. Increases in water prices are faced by large consumers; they then reduce their consumption rates and transfer to lower consumption blocks. These shifts are responsible for the increase in the average consumption values in the lower blocks despite the increase in the marginal prices.

AB  - A multi-objective structural design of a serpentine channel heat sink is presented in this paper. In the structural modelling of the heat sink, channel width, fin width, channel height and inlet velocity are defined as the design variables, ‘total thermal resistance’ and the ‘pressure drop’ as the two objectives, subject to constraints of fixed length and width of the heat sink. In this study, a multi-objective artificial swarm fish algorithm with a variable population size using a non-dominated sorting method (MOAFNS) has been developed to handle the optimisation, in which fast approach of Pareto-optimal solution recommendation using the Pareto risk index is proposed to handle the optimal trade-offs between the two conflicting thermal objectives. Then, the optimal solutions have been validated by performing related experiments. The Pareto-front indicates a trade-off between ‘total thermal resistance’ and ‘pressure drop’. Numerical results and experimental data have reached an agreement that reduction in both thermal resistance and pressure drop can be achieved via determination of channel configuration and inlet velocity using MOAFNS, which results in desired thermal performance of the heat sink.

AB  - Problem
Gender differences of young drivers involved in crashes and the associated differences in risk factors have not been fully explored in the United States (U.S.). Accordingly, this study investigated the topic, where the odds ratios (ORs) were used to identify differences in crash involvements between male and female young drivers.
Method
Logistic regression models for injury severity of young male drivers and young female drivers were developed. Different driver, environmental, vehicle, and road related factors that have affected young female drivers' and young male drivers' crash involvements were identified using the models.
Results
Results indicated that some variables are significantly related to female drivers' injury risk but not male drivers' injury risk and vice versa. Variables such as driving with valid licenses, driving on weekends, avoidance or slow maneuvers at time of crash, non-collision and overturn crashes, and collision with a pedestrian were significant variables in female driver injury severity model but not in young male driver severity model. Travel on graded roadways, concrete surfaces, and wet road surfaces, collision with another vehicle, and rear-end collisions were variables that were significant in male-driver severity model but not in female-driver severity model.
Summary
Factors which increase young female drivers' injury severity and young male drivers' injury severity were identified. This study adds detailed information about gender differences and similarities in injury severity risk of young drivers.
Practical applications
It is important to note that the findings of this study show that gender differences do exists among young drivers. This sends a message to the industry that the transportation professionals and researchers, who are developing countermeasures to increase the traffic safety, may need to pay attention to the differences. This might be particularly true when developing education materials for driver training for young/inexperienced drivers.

AB  - There has been enormous land use change taking place in China since 1978 followed by impacts on the environmental, social and economical conduct of the society. Benchmark land price as the key indicator to evaluate the performance of urban land use provides guidelines for land use rights selling and transferring in order to overcome lack of market data and experiences in land transaction. The purpose of this study is to develop a sustainability analysis of urban residential development mainly considering the impacts of benchmark land price and the variations of urban land use with a case study of Nanjing city in JiangSu province of China. The integration of empirical models, GIS technology and 3D data visualization were proposed to be an integrated tool that is able to examine the spatial distribution of land price differences and provide important conceptual insights into the spatial effects within urban land markets. Furthermore, the simulation results obtained in empirical models were combined with land use variations to provide important sustainable insights into the developing trend of benchmark land price in recent years and further explain for the Decision Maker and urban planners whether urban areas develop sustainably or not.

AB  - Because supply chains are complex systems prone to uncertainty, statistical analysis is a useful tool for capturing their dynamics. Using data on acquisition history and data from case study reports, we used regression analysis to predict backorder aging using National Item Identification Numbers (NIINs) as unique identifiers. More than 56,000 NIINs were identified and used in the analysis. Bayesian analysis was then used to further investigate the NIIN component variables. The results indicated that it is statistically feasible to predict whether an individual NIIN has the propensity to become a backordered item. This paper describes the structure of a Bayesian network from a real-world supply chain data set and then determines a posterior probability distribution for backorders using a stochastic simulation based on Markov blankets. Fuzzy clustering was used to produce a funnel diagram that demonstrates that the Acquisition Advice Code, Acquisition Method Suffix Code, Acquisition Method Code, and Controlled Inventory Item Code backorder performance metric of a trigger group dimension may change dramatically with variations in administrative lead time, production lead time, unit price, quantity ordered, and stock. Triggers must be updated regularly and smoothly to keep up with the changing state of the supply chain backorder trigger clusters of market sensitiveness, collaborative process integration, information drivers, and flexibility.

AB  - The demand of energy is increasing at an escalating pace and cannot be fulfilled entirely by conventional energy systems, due to their limited supplies. In addition to this they have a radical impact on the environment. In comparison to them hybrid energy systems are a suitable combination of renewable and non-renewable energy systems which keeps into account the advantages of both these systems, thus able to achieve reduction in cost of implementation and maintenance of the system, limited emission levels, improvement in reliability of the overall system etc. Designing of hybrid energy system for a locality and its implementation is an uphill task as the input parameters of the sources considered are randomly varying with time and are also independent of the load requirements. The paper encompasses review on various important sectors needed to be considered while designing and implementation of hybrid energy system; this includes configurations, criteria selection, sizing methodologies and control & energy management. This will help the designer to use suitable design constraints required while implementing hybrid energy system for grid connected or in off grid modes as per the requirement of the locality.

AB  - Most previous research studies on the general factors related to the adoption of mobile services have used multiple regression methods (the technology acceptance mode or structural equation modeling) and some have used MCDM tools. However, these studies still have some shortcomings, so they cannot provide the enough precise information about these factors and their weightings. This information is needed by firms so that they can allocate their limited resources to the most important factors and draw appropriate strategies to improve the content and quality of their mobile services. This study reviewed the literature and constructed a three-layer hierarchical table of the factors that affect consumers' adoption of mobile services. A pair-wise questionnaire was then designed and distributed to managers who are familiar with the mobile services of Chunghwa Telecom, a leading telecommunication company. From the data collected, the weight of each factor was directly calculated, using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). The paper analyzes the importance of factors and three implications are also discussed. Hopefully, this knowledge will enable firms to better utilize their limited resources, by devising management strategies based on the weights of these factors, and therefore, to meet consumer demand at lower cost and with greater efficiency.

To examine the effect of ordering information in a patient decision aid (PtDA) about treatments for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
Methods
We recruited 643 individuals to imagine that they had been diagnosed with OSA and to choose between treatment options. A value clarification exercise was used to determine which attributes of treatment mattered most to each individual. Before deciding on their preferred treatment option, we randomly assigned participants to view information with attributes in: a pre-specified order (Group 1), order of what mattered most last (Group 2), and first (Group 3).
Results
Of the 510 participants who provided usable results, viewing information that mattered most first was associated with choosing the treatment option most concordant with their informed values. The order effect was most pronounced in younger individuals.
Conclusions
In this study of hypothetical patients, order effects were found to improve the information patients focussed on, potentially improving the quality of their decisions.
Practice implications
The order of information presented in a PtDA can inadvertently influence patients’ choices. By tailoring information order for each patient, developers cannot only overcome this dilemma, but also make it simpler for patients to choose the option that is best for them.

AB  - This paper explores why complex systems produce avoidable waste, and presents a new qualitative method to help managers think strategically about waste avoidance. Some approaches to analysing waste creation focus on measuring waste (e.g. Life Cycle Assessment), while others model process solutions (e.g. Lean). However, these are somewhat limited as (a) measures are not always appropriate and do not identify solutions, (b) modelling human as well as process factors is needed as both cause waste, and (c) implementable solutions should be understood and socially negotiated by powerful stakeholders as well as modelled by analysts. Furthermore, the interlinked nature of industrial processes means that managing sources of waste may be complicated by system perturbations from up/downstream operations that stimulate waste creation. Recognising this, we reflect on a new approach, called Waste And Source Analysis – WASAN, that supports the analysis of: sources of waste and how to manage them; wider systemic factors such as how up/downstream operations cause waste generation; and supports stakeholders in exploring and negotiating solutions to optimally manage these sources and systems. We also propose a framework to think through the human and technical reasons for why sources produce waste: behavioural, knowledge, material, processing and systemic (BKMPS) causes of waste. We use this framework to reflect on a case study of applying WASAN to analyse radioactive sources in the UK's nuclear industry. Our theoretical contributions reach beyond waste minimisation and systemic thinking as we consider the generic factors needed to analyse other complex systems.

AB  - Rapid radiations have long been regarded as the most challenging issue for elucidating poorly resolved phylogenies in evolutionary biology. The eight diploid AA- genome species in the genus Oryza represent a typical example of a closely spaced series of recent speciation events in plants. However, questions regarding when and how they diversified have long been an issue of extensive interest but remain a mystery. Here, a data set comprising >60kb of 53 singleton fragments and 16 intergenic regions is used to perform phylogenomic analyses of all eight AA- genome species plus four diploid Oryza species with BB-, CC-, EE- and GG- genomes. We fully reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of AA- genome species with confidence. Oryza meridionalis, native to Australia, is found to be the earliest divergent lineage around 2.93mya, whereas O. punctata, a BB- genome species, serves as the best outgroup to distinguish their phylogenetic relationships. They separated from O. punctata approximately 9.11mya during the Miocene epoch, and subsequently radiated to generate the entire AA- genome lineage diversity. The success in resolving the phylogeny of AA- genome species highlights the potential of phylogenomics to determine their divergence and evolutionary histories.

AB  - The success of a mass roll out of Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) is largely underpinned by establishment of suitable charging infrastructure. This paper presents a geospatial modelling approach, exploring the potentials for deployment of publicly accessible charging opportunities for consumers based on two traits — one, trip characteristics (journey purpose and destinations); two, PEV adoption intensity. Its applicability is demonstrated through a case study, which combines census statistics indicating lifestyle trends, family size, age group and affordability with travel patterns for an administrative region in the North-East England. Three categories of potential PEV users have been identified — ‘New Urban Colonists’, ‘City Adventurers’ and ‘Corporate Chieftains’. Analysis results indicate that Corporate Chieftains, primarily residing in peri-urban locations, with multi-car ownership and availability of onsite overnight charging facilities form the strongest group of early adopters, irrespective of public charging provision. On the other hand, New Urban Colonists and City Adventurers, primarily residing in the inner-city regions, show potentials of forming a relatively bigger cohort of early PEV adopters but their uptake is found to be dependent largely on public charging facilities. Our study suggests that effective PEV diffusion in city-regions globally would require catering mainly to the demands of the latter group, focussing on development of a purpose-built public charging infrastructure, both for provision of on-street overnight charging facilities in residential locations and for fast charging at parking hubs (park and ride, amenities and commercial centres).

AB  - This paper presents best weight pattern evaluation approach to solve short-term multi-objective hydrothermal generation scheduling (HTGS) which determines the allocation of power demand among the committed generating units, to minimize operating cost and minimal impacts on environment subjected to physical and technological constraints. A multi-chain interconnected hydro system having non-linear relationship between water discharge rate and power generation is undertaken with due consideration of water transport delay between connected reservoirs. The best weights are computed by conventional statistical measures, which characterize the correlation coefficients matrix evolution. The solution methodology hybridizes global and local search techniques. Predator-prey optimization (PPO) is undertaken as a global search technique and Powell’s pattern search (PPS) is exploited as a local search technique. The results among the competing objectives obtained by the proposed method are compared with various results reported in the literature. The sensitivity and robustness of the proposed technique are evaluated by performing statistical analysis of results obtained based on independent runs. The integration of PPO and PPS improves the quality of solution and convergence characteristics.

AB  - Summary
Reservoir operating rules are often derived using either a fitting or a simulation-based optimization method in the context of implicit stochastic optimization. Analysis of the parameter uncertainty in reservoir operating rules and their impact is necessary for robust solutions. In the present study, parameter uncertainty for reservoir operating rules is analyzed using two statistical methods, linear regression (LR) and Bayesian simulation (BS). LR estimates the confidence interval based on fitting the operating rules to the optimal deterministic solution. BS deals with the operating rule parameters as stochastic variables and treats the goodness-of-fit to the optimal deterministic solution or the operation profits as the likelihood measure. Two alternative techniques, the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC), are implemented for the BS uncertainty analysis. These methods were applied to the operating rules of China’s Three Gorges Reservoir. The LR performed less than the BS, and the MCMC outperformed the GLUE. Even for the BS methods, the operation profits criterion was better than the goodness-of-fit criterion for deriving the reservoir operating rules.

AB  - Summary
Large scale urbanization has resulted in greater withdrawals of shared waters and this withdrawal has been largely dependent on the hegemony of the riparian’s. The last few decades has seen the upward surge of many countries in terms of development as well as hegemony. Existing structures of established water sharing framework typically evaluate only parameters related to historic water use such as historic water demand and supply, contribution to flow, and hydrology. Water conflicts and cooperation is affected by various issues related with development and hegemony. Characterization and quantification of development and hegemony parameters is a very complex process. This paper establishes a novel approach to predict river basins at risk; the approach addresses the issue of water conflict and cooperation within a methodologically more rigorous predictive framework. Fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique is used in this paper to undertake the risk assessment of international transboundary rivers. In this paper the fuzzy domain of risk consists of two fuzzy sets – hegemony and development, indices of which are developed with the help of fuzzy synthetic evaluation techniques. Then the compositional rule-base is framed to ascertain the fuzzy risk. This fuzzy risk can be further used to prioritize all the international river basins which can help in the identification of potentially high risk basins. Risk identification of international river basins is not only scientifically valuable, but also practically highly useful. Identifying those basins that are likely to be particularly prone to conflict or cooperation is of high interest to policy makers.

AB  - Decisions related to supplier improvement and selection are inherently multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems and are strategically important to companies. Although efforts have been made to discover systematic methods to select the proper supplier, these efforts have assumed that the criteria are independent, which is not actually the case. Some studies that have treated the criteria as interdependent use additive models to obtain aggregate performance. We propose a novel fuzzy integral-based model that addresses the interdependence among the various criteria and employs the non-additive gap-weighted analysis. The structure of the relationships among the criteria and the criteria weights are developed using Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) combined with a fundamental concept of an analytic network process (ANP) called DANP. The fuzzy integral is then used to aggregate the gaps using the weights obtained from the DANP. The proposed model addresses the shortcomings of prior models and provides a more reasonable representation of the real world. The method is demonstrated using supplier evaluation and improvement data from a Taiwanese company.

In addition, this new technology could be used to improve energy efficiency in the traffic operation, due to its capability to update the ATO (Automatic Train Operation) driving commands not only at stations but also along the journey. In this paper a new optimization algorithm is proposed to design ATO CBTC speed profiles to minimize energy consumption, generating the Pareto optimal curve. The algorithm is a multi-objective NSGA-II-F based on simulation of the train motion under uncertainty. The main source of uncertainty in the consumption calculation is the mass of the train, which is dependent on the passenger load, and it is modeled as a fuzzy number. In addition, a new method is proposed to fill running time gaps with dominated points, providing a pseudo-Pareto curve. The NSGA-II-F algorithm has been applied to design ATO CBTC optimal speed profiles in a case study of Metro de Madrid, providing additional energy savings up to 7.3% compared to former fixed block signalling systems and a well time-distributed pseudo-Pareto curve for the running times required by the traffic regulation system.

AB  - The paper is concentrated on improvement of a delivery process of parts and components for a vehicle production company based on just-in-time system. The authors have proposed a four-stage solution procedure. In the first stage the logistics process has been analysed and modelled using EPC notation in ARIS Business Architect. The major activities in the process, cause and effect relationships, key resources (personal and technical) and their assignment to the activities have been identified. In the second stage, multicriteria mathematical model has been constructed to evaluate the process performance. In the third stage, the simulation model has been built with an application of simulation tool ARIS Business Simulator, and the computational experiments have been carried out. Next, in the fourth stage the set of variants representing changes in the current logistics process have been created, equivalent changes have been introduced to the simulation model and computational experiments have been carried out. Based on the nondeterministic simulation results, in the next stage the variants have been ranked with an application of stochastic decision aiding method – stochastic ELECTRE III. Finally, the compromise variant of the logistics process improvement has been recommended.

AB  - Recently, great attention has been paid to the data envelopment analysis (DEA) for the analysis of efficiency of transportation systems. In real world applications, the data of production processes cannot be precisely measured or can be affected by ambiguity. This is particularly worrying when assessing efficiency with frontier-type models, such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models, since they are very sensitive to possible data errors. Many research works have faced the problem of using DEA models when the inputs and outputs are uncertain. Fuzzy Theory based methods are one of the approaches that have been recently proposed even without a determined (or unique) framework. In this work we have defined a fuzzy version of the classical DEA models, and, in particular, a feature selection analysis has been developed to investigate the effects of uncertainty on the efficiency of the considered transport services. The feature selection method developed in this paper is based on fuzzy entropy measures and it can be applied to DMUs (Decision Making Units) on the entire frontier. Having identified the efficient and inefficient DMUs in fuzzy DEA analysis, the focus is on the stability of classification of DMUs into efficient and inefficient performers. A numerical example is then presented, considering as DMUs a set of international container ports with given number of inputs and outputs properly modified.

AB  - This paper focuses on standards battles for photovoltaic technological systems. Five photovoltaic technologies are currently commercially available and it is still unclear which of these technologies will emerge as the dominant design. Based on the literature and on expert interviews, we develop and analyze categories and factors for technology dominance for these systems. By applying the analytic hierarchy process, we determine the importance of these factors and the chances of one of these five technologies becoming the dominant photovoltaic technology. The crisp and fuzzy (logarithmic fuzzy preference programming) analytic hierarchy process method is used to analyze the data. The results show that the standard support strategy is the most important category, and that pricing strategy and technological superiority are the most influential factors in the dominance process. Furthermore, the first generation technology mono-crystalline silicon photovoltaic has the best chance of achieving dominance (30% chance). The results of this study are useful for multiple stakeholders (e.g. energy policy makers and photovoltaic module companies) who have to make the decision as to which standard should be supported for photovoltaic technology.

AB  - Abstract:
The benefit–risk balance of a medicine is a recurring concept throughout this book which is explored in more detail in this chapter. It may be evaluated at the level of a patient population or an individual, requiring a judgement based on a variety of factors. Several initiatives in recent years have aimed to improve the quality and consistency of assessments, by creating frameworks and identifying suitable tools and graphical representations for analysing and clearly illustrating complex information. Growing transparency means that the reasoning behind benefit–risk decisions taken by regulators is more accessible to the public. The benefit–risk balance of a product also needs to be effectively communicated to relevant external audiences using carefully selected content and appropriate formats.

AB  - New solar space power system (SSPS) is designed for harvesting solar energy in space and its conversion and transmission to the Earth using laser radiation. This laser system needs to be kept within constant temperature range and the cooling system should have no moving parts, which makes a Peltier device (thermoelectric cooling; TEC) to be a viable option. The challenge of the TEC system is low coefficient of performance and need of a huge radiator to dissipate excess low-grade heat into the space. The present study analyses and optimizes the TEC system for SSPS with use of functionally gradated material (FGM) semiconductors. The performance of FGM semiconductors is calculated against set of objectives and constrains, taking into account temperature-dependent properties. Application of FGM vs. homogeneous TEC materials allows increase of COP by several times, halving current to form-factor ratio.

However, these methods have the problem of the parameter adaptation and many researchers have proposed modifications using fuzzy logic to solve this problem and obtain better results than the original methods. In this study a comprehensive review is made of the optimization techniques in which fuzzy logic is used to dynamically adapt some important parameters in these methods. In this paper, the survey mainly covers the optimization methods of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), which in the last years have been used with fuzzy logic to improve the performance of the optimization methods.

For these cases, experts may provide their opinion only about certain aspects of the disease and remain silent for those unknown features. Feeling the need of prioritizing different experts based on their given information, this article uses a novel concept for assigning confident weights to different experts which are mainly based on their provided information. Experts provide their opinions about various symptoms using intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrix (IFSM). In this article, we propose an algorithmic approach based on intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS) which explores a particular disease reflecting the agreement of all experts. This approach is guided by the group decision making (GDM) model and uses cardinals of IFSS as novel concept. We have used choice matrix (CM) as an important parameter which is based on choice parameters of individual expert. This article has also validated the proposed approach using distance measurements and consents of the majority of experts. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a suitable case study.

This system after receiving both functional variables of the gas transmission network and faults signals makes right decisions to eliminate and repair the conditions of the transmission network according to its database established through experience gathered from experts. These decisions are expressed in the form of some scenarios with different desirability degrees. Desirability degrees measure the outcomes of the decisions taken for the aforementioned conditions; this in turn will assist the managers in choosing the best ones. The user interface properly developed is graphical and provides the manager a good facility to easily use the system without any hesitation at the occurrence time of crisis.

AB  - Summary
Adoption of an integrated approach to water management strongly forces policy and decision-makers to focus on hydrometric monitoring systems as well. Existing hydrometric networks need to be assessed and revised against the requirements on water quantity data to support integrated management. One of the questions that a network assessment study should resolve is whether a current monitoring system can be consolidated in view of the increased expenditures in time, money and effort imposed on the monitoring activity. Within the last decade, governmental monitoring agencies in Turkey have foreseen an audit on all their basin networks in view of prevailing economic pressures. In particular, they question how they can decide whether monitoring should be continued or terminated at a particular site in a network. The presented study is initiated to address this question by examining the applicability of a method called “reference point approach” (RPA) for network assessment and reduction purposes. The main objective of the study is to develop an easily applicable and flexible network reduction methodology, focusing mainly on the assessment of the “performance” of existing streamflow monitoring networks in view of variable operational purposes. The methodology is applied to 13 hydrometric stations in the Gediz Basin, along the Aegean coast of Turkey. The results have shown that the simplicity of the method, in contrast to more complicated computational techniques, is an asset that facilitates the involvement of decision makers in application of the methodology for a more interactive assessment procedure between the monitoring agency and the network designer. The method permits ranking of hydrometric stations with regard to multiple objectives of monitoring and the desired attributes of the basin network. Another distinctive feature of the approach is that it also assists decision making in cases with limited data and metadata. These features of the RPA approach highlight its advantages over the existing network assessment and reduction methods.

By correcting the faulty measurements with a final correcting factor, the strategy covers five steps: fault detection, construction of correcting alternatives, performance forecasting, alternatives outranking, and fault correction. System energy, indoor air quality, human thermal comfort, and control efficiency are considered as a whole to evaluate the operating performance. Taking the supply air temperature sensor faults as testing examples, the strategy is tested in a virtual air conditioning system and simulated on TRNSYS platform. The testing results show that a large fault correcting factor is obtained in the first hour, an adjusting phase presents in the next several hours, and the correction factor keeps unchanged finally. High level of calculating accuracy is required for the performance prediction model. Also, for the outranking evaluation model, the thresholds and weight coefficients should be assigned appropriately to meet the requirements of building functions and/or owners.

AB  - For the past 20 years, the European context has been policy-driven by several directives to reduce pollution, one of the most important for industries being the industrial emissions directive (IED). The IED's objective is to minimise pollution from various industrial sources throughout the European Union. One means of attaining the objective is to implement techniques which have at least the same performance as reference techniques called best available techniques (BAT) given at European level. The study of existing methodologies on performance assessment of proven or emerging techniques has made it apparent that there are none taking into account the 12 criteria proposed by the Annex III of the IED to evaluate technique performances. Even if innovative techniques are not considered by the IED, support to (public or private) researchers in their development in terms of assessment methodology must be proposed. This is what we present in this article. The methodology based on a tree-structured information system (objectives, criteria, indicators) and a qualitative assessment of indicators (environmental, technical, economic and social) is an initial approach to an innovative technique assessment method considering BAT on laboratory or industrial scales. In an aim to adapt the criteria and indicators to a specific process, assessment methodologies must be adaptable. Our method allows for choosing indicators to comply perfectly with the process studied. Only the first level of the tree is fixed. The other branches could be adapted to the case studied. Performance assessment is based on a five-level scale coupled with a simple multi-criteria analysis (MCA) method. Three different applications (sludge valorisation, urban wastewater treatment, soil remediation) were carried out to validate the methodology, two of them are presented. Applications of this methodology show its usefulness in the validation of techniques for specific process and local application of the BAT concept and the performance assessment regarding BAT definition. It can then be used to detect innovative and emerging techniques to be proposed for the reviewing of the European BREF documents.

AB  - As the green movement spreads across the globe, organizations are under pressure to reduce the emissions across their supply chain. On the other hand, they need to cut supply costs to gain a competitive edge. This paper proposes Green DEA (GDEA), a comprehensive approach based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with carbon footprint monitoring. GDEA builds on an existing DEA model with weight restrictions and dual role factors, and introduces carbon footprints as necessary dual role factors with weight restrictions. Unlike other researches, GDEA incorporates heterogeneous suppliers and also takes into account regional emission compliance standards and laws. GDEA encourages suppliers to go green and cut down their carbon footprints and comply with emission norms along with reducing costs in order to survive competition. Results from model validation in a well-known automobile spare parts manufacturer in India are presented to verify the GDEA approach. Overall, GDEA cuts across a huge and varied supplier base, caters to almost all businesses, is environment-friendly and robust.

AB  - Manufacturing companies are continuously facing the challenge of operating their manufacturing processes and systems in order to deliver the required production rates of high quality products, while minimizing the use of resources. Production quality is proposed in this paper as a new paradigm aiming at going beyond traditional six-sigma approaches. This new paradigm is extremely relevant in technology intensive and emerging strategic manufacturing sectors, such as aeronautics, automotive, energy, medical technology, micro-manufacturing, electronics and mechatronics. Traditional six-sigma techniques show strong limitations in highly changeable production contexts, characterized by small batch productions, customized, or even one-of-a-kind products, and in-line product inspections. Innovative and integrated quality, production logistics and maintenance design, management and control methods as well as advanced technological enablers have a key role to achieve the overall production quality goal. This paper revises problems, methods and tools to support this paradigm and highlights the main challenges and opportunities for manufacturing industries in this context.

KW  - Heterogeneous wireless networks
KW  - Media independent handover
KW  - Best network selection
AB  - In the next generation wireless networks, different technologies belonging to one or more operators should be integrated to form a heterogeneous environment based on an IP core network infrastructure. This ensures user mobility and service continuity by maintaining connections when switching between various technologies and it introduces new resources and possibilities for applications. In this context, an automatic interface selection based on instantaneous and practical constraints and user preferences (Quality of Service (QoS) parameters, available resources, security, power consumption, etc.) is therefore required. The different network selection and handover schemes proposed in the literature can be classified into three approaches according to who is responsible for making the handover decision: the terminal, the network or by a cooperation between both of them. However, these approaches keep presenting some drawbacks; namely the problem of resources management and network load balancing whenever the selection is controlled by the mobile terminal (MT) and the problem of scalability and unknown operator's management policy whenever the selection is rather controlled by the network. In this article, first we propose a MIH based approach for handover initiation and preparation for heterogeneous wireless network. The proposed framework is based on the principals of IEEE 802.21 for context information gathering and optimized handover decision making. Second, we propose a new architecture and new network selection scheme that explicitly take into account the current resource usage and the user preferences. Furthermore, our solution ensures the selection of the most suitable network for each flow while taking into consideration its expectations in terms of QoS. A feasibility study of implementing a new architecture on a single MT is evaluated by using typical scenarios and using various algorithms. Thanks to the introduced function entities and modules in the proposed architecture, network utilization balancing and user and application expectations, which are successfully assured without operator intervention. Performance analysis shows that the proposed algorithm best meets the common quality requirements.

AB  - Balancing biodiversity conservation and rural food security is a pressing challenge for developing countries, with tropical agro-grasslands facing particularly high human dependence and species’ endangerment. We explored the potential influences of agricultural growth and allocation of multiple landuses on the status of two threatened species inhabiting semiarid agro-grasslands of India. Sampling 1km2 cells for flagship lesser florican Sypheotides indica and 0.03ha plots for spiny-tailed lizard Saara hardwickii, we modeled species’ abundances with land-cover, vegetation structure, and disturbances using N-mixture (florican) and poisson (lizard) models. Florican abundance responded unimodally to herbaceous biomass (grassland proportion×ground-vegetation height), wherein, numbers peaked at optimally large combinations of grassland proportion (0.5–1) and ground-vegetation height (35–65cm). Whereas, lizard abundance was positively influenced by grassland occurrence and ground-vegetation<50cm cover but negatively influenced by cropland occurrence. Livestock grazing promoted short vegetation over tall vegetation, partially hindering florican but facilitating lizard. Such inter-specific differences in landuse response invoked multi-criteria planning based on surrogates of ecologically distinct species-groups. Fitting our models to simulated landuse scenarios, we demonstrated that managing florican habitats as grassland interspersed with croplands and pastures spared rotationally provided optimal results at low production-level. However, projected agricultural growth would cause considerable declines of florican (>30%) and lizard (>20%) populations. To prevent this, remaining florican occupied agro-grasslands should be secured as Community/Conservation reserves so that further landuse conversions can be legally restricted. Simultaneously, government schemes like food provisioning to small farmers through public distribution system could be harnessed to compensate for production deficit within/adjoining reserves.

AB  - The worldwide water supply represents a significant portion of the global energy consumption. This energy consumption, related to the collection, treatment and transportation of water, entails a large amount of costs. However, these costs are liable to be minimised with and/or without reduction on energy consumption. The purpose of this paper is to provide a review about measures and methods to achieve water supply systems efficiency. The paper summarises and compares previous investigations in order to provide the state-of-the-art to the reader. Measures with and without investment in order to reduce costs and energy consumption are presented. The paper also explores the use of hydraulic simulation and optimisation strategies in water supply systems, involving topics such as demand prediction, networks design, pumps operation, real-time operations and renewable energy production. Although the great advances in the area, there are unexplored (or poorly explored) methodologies that can be tested and maybe applied in a large number of water systems. There are also some important issues, mentioned in this paper, which must be considered in order to attend specific requirements of the water industries.

AB  - A software platform (QUIMET) was developed to improve the sorting, analysis, calculations, visualizations, and interpretations of hydrogeochemical data in a GIS environment. QUIMET is composed of a geospatial database plus a set of tools specially designed for graphical and statistical analysis of hydrogeochemical data. The geospatial database has been designed to include organic and inorganic chemical records, as well as relevant physical parameters (temperature, Eh, electrical conductivity). The instruments for analysis cover a wide range of methodologies for querying, interpreting, and comparing groundwater quality data. They include, among others, chemical time-series analysis, ionic balance calculations, correlation of chemical parameters, and calculation of various common hydrogeochemical diagrams (Salinity, Schöeller–Berkaloff, Piper, and Stiff). The GIS platform allows the generation of maps of the spatial distribution of parameters and diagrams. Moreover, it allows performing a complete statistical analysis of the data including descriptive statistic univariate and bivariate analysis, the latter including generation of correlation matrices and graphics. Finally, QUIMET offers interoperability with other external platforms. The platform is illustrated with a geochemical data set from the city of Badalona, located on the Mediterranean coast in NE Spain.

AB  - This study proposes a multiple attributes decision making (MADM) method for solving glamor stock selection problem based on fundamental analysis. Traditional analyzes rely on choosing key financial ratios in making comparison, or by observing the trends of change in various financial variables (also termed as criteria or signals in this study). However, most of the criteria for stock selection have inter-dependent/interactive characteristics. In practice, investors often have to make compromising decisions when target stocks indicate conflicting performance outcomes in different criteria. Traditional methods have difficulty in making decision while facing inter-dependent criteria and compromise alternatives. Thus, this study proposes a combined MADM method to retrieve financial experts’ knowledge for glamor stock selection. The proposed method not only helps to identify the ideal glamor stock, but the pertaining insights may also be used for the management teams of glamor stocks to prioritize their improvement plans. In addition, this study provides an empirical case in analyzing five glamor stocks of semiconductor industry in Taiwan. The result indicates that the proposed method for glamor stock selection is effective and provides meaningful implications for investors and management teams to refer. The selected top ranking stock consistently outperformed the other four glamor stocks in 32month and 44month holding periods from May 2009 to December 2012 with statistical significance, which indicated the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between environmental factors and public health is critical to improving sustainability at a sub-national level. Proposals to evaluate the status of environmental health in a region must consider factors including the diversity of indicators, geographical scale, incomplete or inaccurate data and the need for focused methodologies that capture the complexity of this subject. This paper presents the design of a system based on expert knowledge to assess environmental sanitation in cities in the Algarve region of Portugal. It was used fuzzy logic to assess uncertainties in the system. Conceptually, the use of fuzzy sets theory is simple and can integrate human expertise. The current proposal demonstrates the usefulness of aggregating information and opinion-based classifications to categorize municipalities according to their environmental health characteristics. The analysis shows that improved environmental sanitation conditions have been observed in municipalities located in the region's center. In the west, municipalities have worse conditions not only in environmental health but also in other sustainability indicators. A main feature of the system, presented here, is the ability for users to select variables to be considered by experts and opinion-makers without re-modeling, which allows the system to be adapted to different situations and scenarios. Therefore, the assessment method based on fuzzy logic is useful to investigators looking for a more systemic assessment of sustainability.

AB  - This paper studies the risk assessment system for water inrush in the karst tunnel using geographic information system (GIS) technology to predict dynamically the water inrush risk and to develop appropriate protective measures. The risk assessment of the water inrush with geological flaws is conducted where the weight is set using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to establish the assessment models, whereas that with no geological flaws is made using the rock mass mechanics theories. The technical route to predict the water inrush risk is based on the geological data obtained prior to prospecting, and the prediction is introduced into the assessment system as background database. The geological and underground water data during construction are combined to correct the water inrush model parameters. The corrected parameters are used to update the basic database of the assessment, and the updated data are employed to assess the water inrush risk before construction. During this research, GIS is introduced into the specialized model of risk assessment of the water inrush. MAPGIS geographic information system software is selected as the basic platform of GIS, and VC++ is selected as the development tool. The assessment of the water inrush model adopted in the system is tested in water inrush cases in the auxiliary tunnel in Jinping II Hydropower Station. The results validate the reliability of the model. The system realizes a real-time assessment of the water rush in the karst tunnel by providing a relatively correct and direct geological basis for the design of waterproof tunnel excavation and offers a practical guide on safe tunnel construction.

KW  - Sustainability assessment
AB  - Renewable energy is considered as a solution for mitigating climate change and environmental pollution; however, an important problem of the application of renewable energy systems (RESs) is that the evaluation of the sustainability of these systems is extremely complex. In order to assess the sustainability of renewable energy systems comprehensively, the use of sustainability indicators (SIs) is often necessary. Since sustainability indicators are necessary to reflect various aspects of sustainability, the development of a general sustainability indicator (GSI) including many basic sustainability indicators (BSIs) becomes critical. In this paper, the methods of selection, quantification, evaluation and weighting of the basic indicators as well as the methods of GSI aggregation are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed. Based on these discussion and the analysis of the uncertainties of sustainability assessment, an effective framework and its procedures of the development of GSI for renewable energy systems is presented. This GSI is not only able to evaluate all the sustainability criteria of RESs, but also can provide numerical results of sustainability assessment for different objective systems. The proposed framework in this study can be used as a guidance of the development of sustainability indicator for various renewable energy systems.

AB  - Chemical product design emerged as a key activity of chemical engineers. Essentially, all chemical-related designs should be considered as product design, with process design being a subset of the product development process. A useful classification that covers a wide range of chemical products consists of basic chemicals, industrial products and consumer-configured products. Another classification focused on usage properties makes the distinction between homogeneous and structured products. In this chapter, a framework is proposed for integrating product development with process design and manufacturing. A powerful systematic method for managing new product projects is Quality Function Development. The formalisation is achieved by the concept of House of Quality. A central issue in product development is the assessment of product properties, and the impact on the environment. The prediction of properties in a broad sense is assisted today by sophisticated computer methods such as QSPR (Quantitative Structure–Property Relationship) and QSAR (Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship). The above issues are illustrated by comprehensive examples.

AB  - This study proposes a quantitative technology forecasting method for prioritizing investments using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis and a verification process to evaluate the prioritization using factor analysis and cluster analysis of the factor scores. To verify the prioritization process of emerging technologies, this study completed two surveys of experts. Cluster analysis of the factor scores based on the second survey is used to verify the results of prioritization using AHP analysis based on the first survey. The results suggest high hit ratios between the prioritization using AHP analysis and the cluster analysis of factor scores. This confirms that the AHP method is significantly reliable as a method for selecting promising electronic device technologies. As the emerging technology market is more changeable than ever before, the study's prioritization and verification process provides a relevantly robust solution.

Thus, the most significant rewards of ECM implementation may be largely forgone. This study investigates the potential of ECM technology for decision support. A research model is proposed and validated via an empirical investigation. The results show that ECM positively influences problem identification and definition, decision making speed and analysis, decision quality, and decision makers' satisfaction.

AB  - The availability of suitable freshwater spawning habitat is considered to be a major factor limiting the natural recruitment of anadromous Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) in the coastal waters of Bangladesh. Against this context, we applied georeferenced habitat database to determine spawning habitat suitability index of Hilsa shad. Landsat imagery and thematic layers were analyzed with ENVI and GIS, and developed a series of GIS models to identify and ranking of suitable spawning grounds. Thus, among the studied 29,484km2 aquatic ecosystems, only 6% (=1851km2) area is the most suitable consisting of the rivers Meghna, Shahbazpur, Tetulia and Ander Manik as well as the channel of Sandwip island. Whereas, 20% (=5996km2) area including river, estuary and near shore water bodies are moderately suitable, and in particular, the offshore deep waters occupying 73% (=21,637km2) area is least suitable. The model outputs were verified after field data of fishers’ indigenous knowledge with an accuracy level of 87%. This study suggests that necessary measures, such as conservation and management of spawning habitat should be implemented for an increased reproductive and recruitment success that will eventually improve populations of wild Hilsa shad in Bangladesh.

AB  - While planning coastal risk management strategies, coastal managers need to assess risk across a range of spatial and temporal scales. GIS-based tools are one efficient way to support them in the decision making process through a scenarios analysis starting from social, economic and environmental information integrated into a common platform. However, this integration process requires a significant effort from a team of scientists in terms of a) identifying the appropriate scales and data resolution for analysing social, environmental and economic issues; b) selecting and linking an appropriate set of tools to build a coupled model; c) representing key emerging (and hence challenging) research issues, such as risk perception and social resilience in the model; d) developing multi-criteria analysis to integrate social, environmental, economic impacts; and e) accounting for the expectations of the stakeholders and therefore optimizing the opportunity for them to interact with the tool development and with the final tool itself. In this spirit, this paper presents an open-source Spatial Decision Support System developed within the THESEUS Project to help decision makers to scopeg optimal strategies to minimise coastal risks. The exploratory tool allows the users to perform an integrated coastal risk assessment, to analyse the effects of different combinations of engineering, social, economic and ecologically based mitigation options, across short (2020s), medium (2050s) and long-term (2080s) scenarios, taking into account physical and non-physical drivers, such as climate change, subsidence, population and economic growth.

AB  - In recent years, as a result of an important agreement with the Italian Ministry of the Environment, Lombardy Region has promoted and supported numerous measures for energy efficiency and renewable energy sources integration within its territory. Subsequently, monitoring campaigns have been launched to evaluate the global outcomes of the different calls and programs. Among other types of interventions, the promotion of the replacement of diesel boilers with high efficiency natural gas boilers represents an effective way to reduce primary energy demand and emissions and, more in general, to support the definitive transition from oil derived fuels to less polluting fuels like natural gas. The research presents the results of the monitoring campaign performed on about 1500 heating system's retrofit interventions subsidized by Lombardy Region within its “Framework Program Agreement in the field of Environment and Energy”. Local energy efficiency programs are particularly important today and have to be designed, managed and monitored to clearly identify the real energy, economic and environmental benefits that they produce. The research presented aims to provide a methodology and useful insights for the implementation of such programs along with their monitoring and analysis processes. In particular, the research illustrates the use of indicators to enable a comparison according to multiple criteria and different perspectives, in particular the societal one and the end-user's one.

AB  - Experts have more difficulty identifying reverse salients in R&D because of increasing technological complexity and a shortened technology lifecycle. As an alternative, we suggest a new and systematic method of identifying and forecasting reverse salients using QFD (quality function deployment), bibliometric analysis, and TIA (trend impact analysis). QFD allows users to systematically identify and prioritize reverse salients. An integration of QFD, bibliometric analysis, and TIA makes it possible to specify key performance indicators of reverse salient in order to identify the performance gap between current and market-required performance and to make a probabilistic forecast about when reverse salients will be corrected. Our method will help managers identify a top priority reverse salient, forecast its future, and thus make better R&D decisions with regard to market requirements. A carbon nanotube biosensor technology is used as an example.

This phenomenon is called “feature fatigue”. Thus it is imperative to analyze product usability in product definition stage. However, most traditional methods of usability evaluation are generally carried out using prototypes which are not available until in the later stage of product development. This paper proposes an approach based on Web mining to analyze product usability. This approach uses the massive online customer reviews on analogous products and features as data source, which are easy to get from Web and can reflect the most updated customer opinions on product usability. Association rule mining techniques are adopted to extract customer opinions on the usability of product features. The Apriori algorithm is used for mining association rules, based on which a usability evaluation method is then presented. A case example is given to validate the proposed approach.

AB  - Hyper-heuristics are emerging methodologies that perform a search over the space of heuristics in an attempt to solve difficult computational optimization problems. We present a learning selection choice function based hyper-heuristic to solve multi-objective optimization problems. This high level approach controls and combines the strengths of three well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (i.e. NSGAII, SPEA2 and MOGA), utilizing them as the low level heuristics. The performance of the proposed learning hyper-heuristic is investigated on the Walking Fish Group test suite which is a common benchmark for multi-objective optimization. Additionally, the proposed hyper-heuristic is applied to the vehicle crashworthiness design problem as a real-world multi-objective problem. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hyper-heuristic approach when compared to the performance of each low level heuristic run on its own, as well as being compared to other approaches including an adaptive multi-method search, namely AMALGAM.

AB  - Recommender Systems (RS) have been being captured a great attraction of researchers by their applications in various interdisciplinary fields. Fuzzy Recommender Systems (FRS) is an extension of RS with the fuzzy similarity being calculated based on the users’ demographic data instead of the hard user-based degree. Based upon the observations that the FRS researches did not offer a mathematical definition of FRS accompanied with its algebraic operations and properties, and the fuzzy similarity degree is not enough to express accurately the analogousness between users, in this paper we will present a systematic mathematical definition of FRS including theoretical analyses of algebraic operations and properties and propose a novel hybrid user-based fuzzy collaborative filtering method that integrates the fuzzy similarity degrees between users based on the demographic data with the hard user-based degrees calculated from the rating histories into the final similarity degrees in order to obtain high accuracy of prediction. Experimental results on some benchmark datasets show that the proposed method obtains better accuracy than other relevant methods. Lastly, an application for the football results prediction is given to illustrate the uses of the proposed method.

AB  - A cement production planning system is expected to minimize energy costs. Further, such a system needs to be as autonomous as possible to decrease time loss during the communication between related departments of the plant. Hence, in this paper, we present a multi-agent system (MAS) in which software agents work collaboratively in order to assist production, planning and sales departments of a cement plant for the generation of cost-effective cement production plans. Implemented system was deployed and actively used inside one of the plants of a leading cement company in Turkey. Evaluation result shows that the utilization of the proposed system caused a significant energy cost saving. Moreover, workers in the planning department of the cement plant saved approximately 75% of their working hour by using the system. Total workload of the employees (including all departments) decreased to its half.

AB  - Programme-based Planning of Natural Resources (PBPNR) is an evolving planning frame for solving complex land use, environmental and forest management problems within hierarchically administrated funding and decision-making schemes. PBPNR acknowledges that an effective planning process requires the combined consideration of environmental, technological, economic and socio-political factors. To reach acceptability, commitment and operability, PBPNR processes need to foster collaboration and learning. For this study, an analysis of 43 collaborative planning methods was conducted to examine their potential to be applied within PBPNR. We present the approach of screening the applicability of methods for specific needs that may occur in PBPNR. The approach is based on a list of key criteria for the phases of a collaborative planning process: problem identification, problem modelling and problem solving. The features of each method were qualitatively assessed and peer-reviewed by a team of experts. Most of the methods are able to deal with qualitative data, support processes to increase transparency in planning and capture the preferences of the participating stakeholders. They also produce understandable results for the three phases. Contrarily, many methods do not offer features to handle uncertainty, nor do they satisfactorily stimulate creativity and innovation in the planning process. The results show that the overall applicability of the reviewed methods for the three planning phases varies according to a cluster analysis basing on the capabilities of the methods. Methods such as “Planning for Real”, “Open Space” and “A'WOT” seem to be particularly promising for a broad range of planning situations.

AB  - The amount of data output into our environment is increasing each day, and the development of new technologies constantly redefines how we interact with information. In the context of product life cycle management, it is not uncommon to use intelligent products to ensure an information continuum throughout the product life cycle (e.g., for traceability purposes). Integrating intelligence and information into products themselves is now possible through numerous technologies (RFID, communicating materials). However, these technologies currently have low memory capacities (several kilobytes or megabytes), whereas to product databases are becoming larger and larger (several gigabytes or terabytes). As a result, a data dissemination process is required to determine the relevant information that should be stored on the product. This paper proposes a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method based on a fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (fuzzy AHP). This method is context-aware and supports the aggregation of opinions from a group of experts. An application is proposed to embed context-sensitive information in a “communicating textile”.

AB  - Intelligent surveillance systems should be able to carry out an exhaustive analysis from multi-sensor information according to multiple events of interest in order to classify situations as normal or abnormal. That is why the design of appropriate fusion methods is essential to combine the information from a number of monitored aspects and achieve a reliable interpretation of the environment state. Unfortunately, these systems operate under highly dynamic conditions. A static configuration of the weights that determine the importance of the monitored aspects or events of interest may lead to a high number of false alarms and the ignorance of critical situations. This paper performs a thorough study of different information fusion algorithms and proposes a method for the automatic reweighting of the values that establish the importance of the analyzed events of interest. This online method is flexible enough for adjusting such weights in each monitored situation to address the dynamic nature of real environments. The experiments, which have been conducted in a real urban traffic environment, demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

Ranking of IVIFN is an important component of any incomplete interval information system. But existing techniques do not give complete information about alternatives in some cases. In this paper, a new method for complete ranking of incomplete interval information using axiomatic set of membership, non membership, vague and precise score functions to IVIFN is proposed and compared with existing techniques using an illustrative example.

AB  - An equilibrium network design model is formulated to determine the optimal configuration of a vehicle sharing program (VSP). A VSP involves a fleet of vehicles (bicycles, cars, or electric vehicles) positioned strategically across a network. In a flexible VSP, users are permitted to check out vehicles to perform trips and return the vehicles to stations close to their destinations. VSP operators need to determine an optimal configuration in terms of station locations, vehicle inventories, and station capacities, that maximizes revenue. Since users are likely to use the VSP resources only if their travel utilities improve, a generalized equilibrium based approach is adopted to design the system. The model takes the form of a bi-level, mixed-integer program. Model properties of uniqueness, inefficiency of equilibrium, and transformations that lead to an exact solution approach are presented. Computational tests on several synthetic instances demonstrate the nature of the equilibrium configuration, the trade-offs between operator and user objectives, and insights for deploying such systems.

AB  - Sustainable supply chain management is a topical area which is continuing to grow and evolve. Within supply chains, downstream distribution from producers to customers plays a significant role in the environmental performance of production supply chains. With consumer consciousness growing in the area of sustainable food supply, food distribution needs to embrace and adapt to improve its environmental performance, while still remaining economically competitive. With a particular focus on the dairy industry, a robust solution approach is presented for the design of a capacitated distribution network for a two-layer supply chain involved in the distribution of milk in Ireland. In particular the green multi-objective optimisation model minimises CO2 emissions from transportation and total costs in the distribution chain. These distribution channels are analysed to ensure the non-dominated solutions are distributed along the Pareto fronts. A multi-attribute decision-making approach, TOPSIS, has been used to rank the realistic feasible transportation routes resulting from the trade-offs between total costs and CO2 emissions. The refined realistic solution space allows the decision-makers to geographically locate the sustainable transportation routes. In addition to geographical mapping the decision maker is also presented with a number of alternative analysed scenarios which forcibly open closed distribution routes to build resiliency into the solution approach. In terms of model performance, three separate GA based optimisers have been evaluated and reported upon. In the case presented NSGA-II was found to outperform its counterparts of MOGA-II and HYBRID.

AB  - Decision on end-of-life product recovery options is affected by many factors; they are factors related to engineering, business, environmental, and societal factors. These factors come from wide spectrum of stakeholders' interests. Perspectives vary from one stakeholder to another; hence, some of these factors are conflicting. For example, product designers' interest in composite light weight material may conflict with recycler's interest in pure and easy-to-recycle material. A method that identifies all stakeholders who are directly involved or indirectly affected by such decision would be beneficial to the selection of right product recovery option. This paper provides a method that guides the process of decision making on end-of-life product recovery option. The method is different from previous ones in its inclusion of all stakeholders who has interest in the process. The proposed method gives decision maker flexibility to accommodate for different cases (Case specific situations). It is enough comprehensive to be general and enough flexible to be specific, this would make the decision taken using this method accurate by selecting appropriate recovery options, and informative by presenting the most influential factors that lead to the decision. Previous methods found in literature are reviewed and been inconsideration when developing the proposed method. Knowledge obtained from industrial best practices and well documented case studies also included. Product designers and business decision makers would benefit from this work on deciding about the fate of their product as a whole or its constituents. The implementation of the developed method is demonstrated through an industrial product; the method robustness is tested by assessing its sensitivity to extreme situations. In conclusion, the decision on end-of-life product recovery option is governed by different stakeholders. A method that considers the collective interests of all stakeholders is apparently needed; such method is developed in this paper and is validated using industrial example.

AB  - Global economic competition has spurred the manufacturing sector to improve and invest in modern equipment to satisfy the needs of the market. In particular, machine tool selection is the most important problem; it plays a primary role in the improvement of productivity and flexibility in the manufacturing environment and involves the imprecise, vague and uncertain information. This paper presents the hybrid approach of the fuzzy ANP (Analytic Network Process) and COPRAS-G (COmplex PRoportional ASsessment of alternatives with Grey relations) for fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making in evaluating machine tools with consideration of the interactions of the attributes. The fuzzy ANP is used to handle the imprecise, vague and uncertain information from expert judgments and model the interaction, feedback relationships and interdependence among the attributes to determine the weights of the attributes. COPRAS-G is employed to present the preference ratio of the alternatives in interval values with respect to each attribute and calculate the weighted priorities of the machine alternatives. Alternatives are ranked in ascending order by priority. As a demonstration of the proposed model, a numerical example is implemented based on the collected data and the literature. The result is then compared with the rankings provided by other methods such as TOPSIS-G, SAW-G and GRA. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to verify the robustness of the ranking. The result highlights that the hybrid approach of the fuzzy ANP and COPRAS-G is a highly flexible tool and reaches an effective decision in machine tool selection.

AB  - Expansive soils can cause enormous damage to buildings and structures, and have been accepted as a risk source for the population. Risk analysis on swell–shrink capacity is essential for evaluating the stability and safety of expansive soils. A novel analysis model was put forward with efficacy coefficient method and entropy coefficient method for the risk analysis. The efficacy coefficient method was adopted in dimensionless treatment based on the theory of multi-objective programming, which was newly adopted for single efficacy coefficient to describe the influence of the considered evaluation index. Meanwhile, the entropy coefficient method was applied to determine the weight coefficient for each index. Then the single efficacy coefficient and the weight coefficient were used for calculating the total efficacy coefficient, which was presented to specify the grade of swell–shrink capacity for the evaluation samples of expansive soils. Furthermore, the classification results of the proposed method were compared with gainable results, and qualitative consistencies could be gained as expected. Therefore, the established model based on the efficacy coefficient method and entropy coefficient method is valid to predict risk analysis on swell–shrink capacity of expansive soils. Moreover, the presented model is more feasible and effective, which could provide useful ways for classification, risk management and design of projects on expansive soils as well as other engineering applications.

AB  - This paper proposes an efficient decomposition and dual-stage multi-objective optimization (DDMO) method for designing water distribution systems with multiple supply sources (WDS-MSSs). Three phases are involved in the proposed DDMO approach. In Phase 1, an optimal source partitioning cut-set is identified for a WDS-MSS, allowing the entire WDS-MSS to be decomposed into sub-networks. Then in Phase 2 a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is employed to optimize the sub-networks separately, thereby producing an optimal front for each sub-network. Finally in Phase 3, another NSGA-II implementation is used to drive the combined sub-network front (an approximate optimal front) towards the Pareto front for the original complete WDS-MSS. Four WDS-MSSs are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results obtained show that the proposed DDMO significantly outperforms the NSGA-II that optimizes the entire network as a whole in terms of efficiently finding good quality optimal fronts.

AB  - This paper presents an assessment of the onshore wind energy potential in Thailand using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). A 9km resolution, 1,150km by 1,750km, wind resource map at 120 m elevation above ground level (agl) is produced based on the NCEP reanalysis database for the three year period of 2009-2011. The onshore wind resource map is validated by comparing the modeling results to observed wind data at 100 m agl from the Pollution Control Department (PCD) of Thailand, and at 120 m agl from the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT). The Mean Square Error (MSE) is computed and is use as the main criterion to evaluate the simulation results. Results showed that, for the study area, the annual mean wind speeds at 120 m agl are in the range of 1.60-5.83 m/s. For its part, the maximum annual mean power density at 120 m agl is approximately 200W/m2 which corresponds to a wind power density of Class 2. Results show that the region has a good wind regime in the mountain areas of western, southern and eastern Thailand. Further assessment is needed to determine if the onshore wind energy resource could be developed and exploited in order to achieve national renewable energy policy targets in Thailand.

AB  - Selection of third party ship management (TPSM) in the shipping industry is a complex decision making problem influenced by various factors, which are sometimes contrary in nature. These factors are interrelated and analysing them often requires knowledge, skills and competence from multiple persons. Although multiple attribute decision making methods such as the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) have been widely applied to tackle service selection in many areas, the feasibility studies of using them in TPSM indeed remain scary showing a significant research gap to be filled. This paper aims to develop a TPSM selection model based on AHP, in which major selection criteria are identified through surveying as well as use the developed modeling in a real TPSM selection case of the Bibby Line shipping company. In the case study, the criteria include price, reputation, location, experience, technical expertise and relationship. Data was collected through a combination of relevant literature and interviews with some domain experts/professionals from shipping and ship management companies. The research findings indicate that experience and reputation are the most important criteria for shipping companies when considering the use of the third party services. Also, the developed model as a transparent decision making tool can effectively facilitate ship owners’ selection of the TPSM services as well as their benchmark with respect to each criterion identified. The model and tool are demonstrated in a real TPSM selection case of the Bibby Line shipping company. Consequently, the results were in agreement with the current model used at Bibby's operations, while it proves to be more straightforward and visible for decision makers. Furthermore, this study also shows the advantages and disadvantages of the selected TPSM compared to the other competitors with respect to different criteria, which provides TPSMs with clear benchmarks to improve their services to meet their customers’ need.

AB  - The use of different domain-specific modeling languages and diverse versions of the same modeling language often entails the need to translate models between the different languages and language versions. The first step in establishing a transformation between two languages is to find their corresponding concepts, i.e., finding correspondences between their metamodel elements. Although, metamodels use heterogeneous terminologies and structures, they often still describe similar language concepts. In this paper, we propose to combine structural metrics (e.g., number of properties per concept) and syntactic metrics to generate correspondences between metamodels. Because metamodel matching requires to cope with a huge search space of possible element combinations, we adapted a local and a global metaheuristic search algorithm to find the best set of correspondences between metamodels. The efficiency and effectiveness of our proposal is evaluated on different matching scenarios based on existing benchmarks. In addition, we compared our technique to state-of-the-art ontology matching and model matching approaches.

AB  - This paper presents an approach for optimal operation of a grid-connected hybrid system to maximize the system expected generated energy while maximizing the electricity sale revenue. The hybrid system consists of a photovoltaic (PV) module, an electrolyser (EL), hydrogen storage tank (HS) and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell (FC). The generated energy is sold to the distribution grid. During the grid interruptions, the hybrid system output is used as an emergency supply to serve the local load, hence increasing the supply reliability. The proposed approach splits the whole problem in two sub problems: revenue maximizing problem (RMP) and expected generation maximizing problem (EGM). RMP finds optimal hourly electricity selling considering hourly variations in electricity price and solar irradiance subjected to HS minimum pressure. EGM uses RMP results and HS minimum pressure to determine expected generated energy (EGE) based on the proposed 4-state generation reliability model for the system. A bi-section search is finally used to find the optimum level for HS minimum pressure to maximize EGE while keeping selling revenue at highest possible level. The impact of optimal system operation on EGE is then evaluated. A series of analyses have been conducted to assess the capability and applicability of the proposed method. Suitable economic indices have also been proposed to evaluate reliability cost/worth of hybrid system application to improve load reliability.
