abstract = {Artificial neural networks have gone through a recent rise in popularity, achieving state-of-the-art results in various fields, including image classification, speech recognition, and automated control. Both the performance and computational complexity of such models are heavily dependant on the design of characteristic hyper-parameters (e.g., number of hidden layers, nodes per layer, or choice of activation functions), which have traditionally been optimized manually. With machine learning penetrating low-power mobile and embedded areas, the need to optimize not only for performance (accuracy), but also for implementation complexity, becomes paramount. In this work, we present a multi-objective design space exploration method that reduces the number of solution networks trained and evaluated through response surface modelling. Given spaces which can easily exceed 1020 solutions, manually designing a near-optimal architecture is unlikely as opportunities to reduce network complexity, while maintaining performance, may be overlooked. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that hyper-parameters which perform well on specific datasets may yield sub-par results on others, and must therefore be designed on a per-application basis. In our work, machine learning is leveraged by training an artificial neural network to predict the performance of future candidate networks. The method is evaluated on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets, optimizing for both recognition accuracy and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can closely approximate the Pareto-optimal front, while only exploring a small fraction of the design space.},

abstract = {The appropriate selection of cloud services is a new need that resulted from the increased use of Cloud Computing. Users want to find the cloud services that best meet their requirements from a large number of available cloud services. This requires a special treatment. Generally, it is done by using various techniques, such as Similarity, Data Mining, Recommender Systems, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods, etc. The main problem of these cited methods, is firstly the large number of returned services and secondly the absence of direct communication between the user and the system. Most of methods are based on previous system knowledge, or they rely on other users feedback. In order to avoid these weaknesses we thought to add a form of communication between the user and the system. For this end, in our contribution, the user is requested to enter the values of his ideal service and then based on the techniques of clustering, the services which are the most closest to the ideal service are selected and returned to the final user.},

abstract = {Cloud Services remain one of the largest segments in the world because it has experienced very rapid growth published, which makes the service selection and recommendation a difficult task for users and service providers, evenly they are a big growth opportunity for companies. For this reason, how to select the best and optimal services will be a great challenge. In this paper we present a new approach for Cloud service selection. We use a top K query, which returns k services that dominate the largest number of services returned by the Skyline query. This request is based on a method that is among the most important and commonly used to compute scoring functions: The weighted sum method, also called linear. Our application is an important decision support tool, because it provides an efficient decision making tool to help decision makers to meet the most suitable services to their preferences. In addition, it combines the advantages of Top-k and Skyline queries without sharing their disadvantages. On the other hand, our results on real data show the relevance of this designed specific algorithm and fully exploit the characteristics of the problem.},

abstract = {In systems engineering, practitioners shall explore numerous architectural alternatives until choosing the most adequate variant. The decision-making process is most of the time a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone activity. The exploration and justification of architectural solutions is ad-hoc and mainly consists in a series of tries and errors on the modeling assets. In this paper, we report on an industrial case study in which we apply variability modeling techniques to automate the assessment and comparison of several candidate architectures (variants). We first describe how we can use a model-based approach such as the Common Variability Language (CVL) to specify the architectural variability. We show that the selection of an architectural variant is a multi-criteria decision problem in which there are numerous interactions (veto, favor, complementary) between criteria.We present a tooled process for exploring architectural variants integrating both CVL and the MYRIAD method for assessing and comparing variants based on an explicit preference model coming from the elicitation of stakeholders' concerns. This solution allows understanding differences among variants and their satisfactions with respect to criteria. Beyond variant selection automation improvement, this experiment results highlight that the approach improves rationality in the assessment and provides decision arguments when selecting the preferred variants.},

Thanks to its various technical and financial advantages, Cloud computing continues to convince every day new users coming from scientific and industrial sectors. To satisfy the various users' requirements, Cloud providers must maximize the performance of their IT resources to ensure the best service at the lowest cost. The performance optimization efforts in the Cloud can be achieved at different levels and aspects. In the present paper, we propose to introduce a fuzzy logic process in scheduling strategy for public Cloud in order to improve the response time, processing time and total cost.

Specifically, why-not questions aim to explain why certain expected tuples are absent from the query results, while why questions try to clarify why certain unexpected tuples are present in the query results. This paper systematically explores the why-not and why questions on reverse top-k queries, owing to its importance in multi-criteria decision making. We first formalize why-not questions on reverse top-k queries, which try to include the missing objects in the reverse top-k query results, and then, we propose a unified framework called WQRTQ to answer why-not questions on reverse top-k queries. Our framework offers three solutions to cater for different application scenarios. Furthermore, we study why questions on reverse top-k queries, which aim to exclude the undesirable objects from the reverse top-k query results, and extend the framework WQRTQ to efficiently answer why questions on reverse top-k queries, which demonstrates the flexibility of our proposed algorithms. Extensive experimental evaluation with both real and synthetic data sets verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the presented algorithms under various experimental settings.},

abstract = {In many fields one encounters the challenge of identifying out of a pool of possible designs those that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. In many applications an exhaustive search for the Pareto-optimal set is infeasible. To address this challenge, we propose the ε-Pareto Active Learning (ε-PAL) algorithm which adaptively samples the design space to predict a set of Pareto-optimal solutions that cover the true Pareto front of the design space with some granularity regulated by a parameter ε. Key features of ε-PAL include (1) modeling the objectives as draws from a Gaussian process distribution to capture structure and accommodate noisy evaluation; (2) a method to carefully choose the next design to evaluate to maximize progress; and (3) the ability to control prediction accuracy and sampling cost. We provide theoretical bounds on ε-PAL's sampling cost required to achieve a desired accuracy. Further, we perform an experimental evaluation on three real-world data sets that demonstrate ε-PAL's effectiveness; in comparison to the state-of-the-art active learning algorithm PAL, ε-PAL reduces the amount of computations and the number of samples from the design space required to meet the user's desired level of accuracy. In addition, we show that ε-PAL improves significantly over a state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization method, saving in most cases 30% to 70% evaluations to achieve the same accuracy.},

It allows customers to save upfront infrastructure costs and focus on features that discriminate their core businesses. The increasing number of offered services makes manual selection of the most suitable service for an application deployment time-consuming and challenging. It also requires a high level of user expertise to make proper decisions. In this paper, we present QuARAM Service Recommender platform, a self-adaptive Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) service selection system that recommends a list of suitable services for cloud application deployment based on application requirements and customer preferences. The process begins with automatic extraction of the application's features, requirements and customer preferences and provides a list of potential services for the application deployment (i.e., resource allocation in our context). Initial experiments show promising results for up to 90% precision of recommended services.},

We introduce the average regret ratio as another means of multi-criteria decision making. Unlike the original k-regret operator that uses the maximum regret ratio, the average regret ratio takes into account the satisfaction of a general user. While assuming the existence of some utility functions for the users, in contrast to the top-k query, it does not require a user to input his or her utility function but instead depends on the probability distribution of the utility functions. We prove that the average regret ratio is a supermodular function and provide a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to find the average regret ratio minimizing set for a database.},

The Inverse Folding Problem (IFP) of finding sequences that fold into a defined structure is in itself an important research problem at the heart of rational protein design. In this work the Preference-Based Genetic Algorithm (PBGA) is employed to find many diversified solutions to the IFP. The PBGA algorithm incorporates a weighted sum model in order to combine fitness and diversity into a single objective function scoring a set of individuals as a whole. By adjusting the sum weights, a direct control of the fitness vs. diversity trade-off in the algorithm population is achieved by means of a selection scheme iteratively removing the least contributing individuals. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the PBGA algorithm compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms both in terms of fitness and diversity.},

abstract = {The service repository in cloud consists of atomic services those need to be composed as per the requirement of consumers. In general, various providers offer different atomic services with same functionalities. These are called similar services and the service selection is the process to choose the best one among them based on the associated Quality of Services. Thus a service selection problem for satisfying the requirement of a consumer with given constraints is conceptualized as a multi-objective optimization problem. Sometime it involves the objectives that have conflict among them and as a result the complexity of the problem increases. In such cases users are requested to provide the feedback on the required QoS and accordingly the solution is offered. This demands sufficient domain knowledge from a user that may not be feasible in real cases. As a result the offered solution may deviate from the intended one. In this work we have proposed a method to calculate an overall measure of a service considering all QoS. It converts the multi-objective problem to single objective. This reduces the exponential complexity of NP-Hard problem into a problem solvable in polynomial time. The proposed Service Selection algorithm does not require any feedback from the users. The algorithm is capable to offer a moderate solution to users considering all requested QoS. The experiment shows that almost in every case the proposed algorithm is able to deliver a solution satisfying all QoS as referred by a user.},

abstract = {Modern logic and physical synthesis tools provide numerous options and parameters that can drastically impact design quality; however, the large number of options leads to a complex design space difficult for human designers to navigate. By employing intelligent search strategies and parallel computing we can tackle this parameter tuning problem, thus automating one of the key design tasks conventionally performed by a human designer. In this paper we present a novel learning-based algorithm for synthesis parameter optimization. This new algorithm has been integrated into our existing autonomous parameter-tuning system, which was used to design multiple 22nm industrial chips and is currently being used for 14nm chips. These techniques show, on average, over 40% reduction in total negative slack and over 10% power reduction across hundreds of 14nm industrial processor macros while reducing overall human design effort. We also present a new higher-level system that manages parameter tuning of multiple designs in a scalable way. This new system addresses the needs of large design teams by prioritizing the tuning effort to maximize returns given the available compute resources.},

The factors that affect the decisions of the software project managers (SPMs) and their potential consequences require attention because project delays and failures are usually related to a series of poor decisions. Objective: To understand how SPMs make decisions based on how they interpret their experiences in the workplace, and also to identify antecedents and consequences of those decisions in order to increase the effectiveness of project management. Method: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with SPMs within a Brazilian large private organization. The data was analyzed using techniques from grounded theory approach. Results: We found that decision-making in software project management is based on knowledge sharing in which the SPM acts as a facilitator before making decisions. This phenomenon is influenced by individual factors, such as experience, communication, negotiation, self-control and systemic view of the project and by contextual factors such as the autonomy of the SPM and team members' technical competence. Also, these factors are mediated by cognitive biases. Conclusions: Due to the uncertainty and dynamism inherent in software projects, the SPMs focus on making, monitoring and adjusting decisions in an argument-driven way.},

abstract = {Many web databases are "hidden" behind proprietary search interfaces that enforce the top-k output constraint, i.e., each query returns at most k of all matching tuples, preferentially selected and returned according to a proprietary ranking function. In this paper, we initiate research into the novel problem of skyline discovery over top-k hidden web databases. Since skyline tuples provide critical insights into the database and include the top-ranked tuple for every possible ranking function following the monotonic order of attribute values, skyline discovery from a hidden web database can enable a wide variety of innovative third-party applications over one or multiple web databases. Our research in the paper shows that the critical factor affecting the cost of skyline discovery is the type of search interface controls provided by the website. As such, we develop efficient algorithms for three most popular types, i.e., one-ended range, free range and point predicates, and then combine them to support web databases that feature a mixture of these types. Rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive real-world online and offline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques and their superiority over baseline solutions.},

Further, to identify antecedents and consequences of those decisions in order to increase the effectiveness of project management. We also aim to refine the research design for future investigations. Method: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with SPMs within a Brazilian large governmental organization and a Brazilian large private organization. Results: We found that decision-making in software project management is based on knowledge sharing in which the SPM acts as a facilitator. This phenomenon is influenced by individual factors, such as experience, knowledge, personality, organizational ability, communication, negotiation, interpersonal relationship and systemic vision of the project and by situational factors such as the autonomy of the SPM, constant feedback and team members' technical competence. Conclusions: Due to the uncertainty and dynamism inherent to software projects, the SPMs focus on making, monitoring and adjusting decisions in an argument-driven way. From the initial relationships among the identified factors, the research design was refined.},
