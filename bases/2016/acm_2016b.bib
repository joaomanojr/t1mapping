abstract = {Cloud Services remain one of the largest segments in the world because it has experienced very rapid growth published, which makes the service selection and recommendation a difficult task for users and service providers, evenly they are a big growth opportunity for companies. For this reason, how to select the best and optimal services will be a great challenge. In this paper we present a new approach for Cloud service selection. We use a top K query, which returns k services that dominate the largest number of services returned by the Skyline query. This request is based on a method that is among the most important and commonly used to compute scoring functions: The weighted sum method, also called linear. Our application is an important decision support tool, because it provides an efficient decision making tool to help decision makers to meet the most suitable services to their preferences. In addition, it combines the advantages of Top-k and Skyline queries without sharing their disadvantages. On the other hand, our results on real data show the relevance of this designed specific algorithm and fully exploit the characteristics of the problem.},

abstract = {This work considers the Citizen-to-Citizen (C2C) service interaction, and shows how it could be implemented using a set of identified affordances and a decision model that considers social attributes. Specifically, we adapt the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to consider social attributes in choosing appropriate service provider for a C2C service request. In our opinion, insights from this work should help in moving Government Social Media policies towards the use of social media platforms for implementing C2C and other emerging services like C2G services.},

abstract = {Information Fusion (IF) systems have long exploited data provided by hard (physics-based) sensors with the aspiration of making sense of the environment they are monitoring. In recent times, the IF community has recognized the potential of utilizing data generated by people, also known as soft data. In this study, we demonstrate how course of action (CoA) generation, one of the key elements of Level 3 High-Level Information Fusion and a vital component for security and defense decision support systems, can be augmented using soft (human-derived) data for improved mission effectiveness. This conceptualization is validated through an elaborate experiment situated in the maritime world. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to apply soft data to automatic CoA generation in the maritime domain.},

abstract = {Many optimization problems are multiobjective in nature in the sense that multiple, conflicting criteria need to be optimized simultaneously. Due to the conflict between objectives, usually, no single optimal solution exists. Instead, the optimum corresponds to a set of so-called Pareto-optimal solutions for which no other solution has better function values in all objectives.Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO) algorithms are widely used in practice for solving multiobjective optimization problems due to several reasons. As randomized blackbox algorithms, EMO approaches allow to tackle problems with nonlinear, nondifferentiable, or noisy objective functions. As set-based algorithms, they allow to compute or approximate the full set of Pareto-optimal solutions in one algorithm run - opposed to classical solution-based techniques from the multicriteria decision making (MCDM) field. Using EMO approaches in practice has two other advantages: they allow to learn about a problem formulation, for example, by automatically revealing common design principles among (Pareto-optimal) solutions (innovization) and it has been shown that certain single-objective problems become easier to solve with randomized search heuristics if the problem is reformulated as a multiobjective one (multiobjectivization).This tutorial aims at giving a broad introduction to the EMO field and at presenting some of its recent research results in more detail. More specifically, we are going to (i) introduce the basic principles of EMO algorithms in comparison to classical solution-based approaches, (ii) show a few practical examples which motivate the use of EMO in terms of the mentioned innovization and multiobjectivization principles, and (iii) present a general overview of state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques. Moreover, we will present some of the most important research results in areas such as indicator-based EMO, preference articulation, surrogate-assisted EMO, and performance assessment.Though classified as introductory, this tutorial is intended for both novices and regular users of EMO. Those without any knowledge will learn about the foundations of multiobjective optimization and the basic working principles of state-of-the-art EMO algorithms. Open questions, presented throughout the tutorial, can serve for all participants as a starting point for future research and/or discussions during the conference.},

abstract = {In systems engineering, practitioners shall explore numerous architectural alternatives until choosing the most adequate variant. The decision-making process is most of the time a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone activity. The exploration and justification of architectural solutions is ad-hoc and mainly consists in a series of tries and errors on the modeling assets. In this paper, we report on an industrial case study in which we apply variability modeling techniques to automate the assessment and comparison of several candidate architectures (variants). We first describe how we can use a model-based approach such as the Common Variability Language (CVL) to specify the architectural variability. We show that the selection of an architectural variant is a multi-criteria decision problem in which there are numerous interactions (veto, favor, complementary) between criteria.We present a tooled process for exploring architectural variants integrating both CVL and the MYRIAD method for assessing and comparing variants based on an explicit preference model coming from the elicitation of stakeholders' concerns. This solution allows understanding differences among variants and their satisfactions with respect to criteria. Beyond variant selection automation improvement, this experiment results highlight that the approach improves rationality in the assessment and provides decision arguments when selecting the preferred variants.},

abstract = {We propose "average regret ratio" as a metric to measure users' satisfaction after a user sees k selected points of a database, instead of all of the points in the database. We introduce the average regret ratio as another means of multi-criteria decision making. Unlike the original k-regret operator that uses the maximum regret ratio, the average regret ratio takes into account the satisfaction of a general user. While assuming the existence of some utility functions for the users, in contrast to the top-k query, it does not require a user to input his or her utility function but instead depends on the probability distribution of the utility functions. We prove that the average regret ratio is a supermodular function and provide a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to find the average regret ratio minimizing set for a database.},

abstract = {Cloud computing provides on-demand resources with no constraints of physical locations. It allows customers to save upfront infrastructure costs and focus on features that discriminate their core businesses. The increasing number of offered services makes manual selection of the most suitable service for an application deployment time-consuming and challenging. It also requires a high level of user expertise to make proper decisions. In this paper, we present QuARAM Service Recommender platform, a self-adaptive Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) service selection system that recommends a list of suitable services for cloud application deployment based on application requirements and customer preferences. The process begins with automatic extraction of the application's features, requirements and customer preferences and provides a list of potential services for the application deployment (i.e., resource allocation in our context). Initial experiments show promising results for up to 90% precision of recommended services.},
