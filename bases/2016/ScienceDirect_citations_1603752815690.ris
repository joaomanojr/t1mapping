AB  - Cities have become important drivers in promoting strategies for sustainable development. The primary objective of this article is to analyze the differences between public transportation in Newcastle upon Tyne, the city considered the most sustainable in the United Kingdom, and Florianópolis, a city with great potential for sustainable policies located in southern Brazil. This comparison may provide models, ideas and actions for the development of Florianópolis as a model of sustainability in South America. Therefore, a comparative analysis is provided: to observe changes, build models, and verify similarities and differences, while seeking to discover which behaviors govern political and social phenomena in the area of urban sustainability. This paper provides a comparative description of social and economic indicators: gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, inflation, employment, as well as the historical population evolution of the two cities. This work contrasts the sustainable transport model used by Newcastle and the reality of the transport needs of Florianópolis. This article is the first in a series to analyze the indicators for sustainable cities, focusing mainly on the reality of the South American city.

AB  - Unplanned large scale developmental projects in recent times have been causing alterations in land use land cover [LULC] at spatial and temporal scales with the substantial changes in the landscape. Uttara Kannada district has the distinction of having highest forest cover in India. Forest ecosystems in the district have witnessed major transformations due to industrialization during the post-independence. Impact of developmental activities during the post-independence era, is evident from barren hill tops due to deforestation. The analysis of temporal spatial data acquired through space borne sensors highlights the decline of evergreen-semi evergreen forest cover from 67.73% (1973) to 32.08% (2013). The ad-hoc approaches adopted in the implementation of developmental projects in the ecologically sensitive regions has impaired the ecosystem services affecting the people’s livelihood. The changes in the landscape structure with LULC changes have altered the functional abilities of an ecosystem evident from lowered hydrological yield, disappearing perennial streams, higher instances of human–animal conflicts, declined ecosystem goods, etc. About 64355Ha of forest land is diverted for various non-forestry activities during the last four decades by the government apart from encroachment of 7072Ha of forest area for agriculture, horticulture activities, etc. Encroachment of forest land has resulted in the land degradation leading to reduced productivity. Alterations in bio-geo chemical and hydrological cycles have necessitated the restoration of native forests in the region to ensure water and food security, and livelihood of the local people. Monitoring and visualization of landscape dynamics helps in evolving appropriate management strategies. LULC dynamics analyses considering agents (developmental projects) through fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) integrated with Markov cellular automata (CA) indicate the developmental projects such as West Coast Paper Mill (WCPM) and Kaiga Nuclear Power House (KNPH) will lead to further fragmentation of forests with spurt in urbanization by 2022. This necessitates framing appropriate policy measures to sustain natural resources focusing on the landscape’s ecological, hydrological, economic and social factors.

AB  - Biomass based energy production has been considered as a part of the solution to energy crisis, which is mainly caused by diminishing fossil fuel resources and environmental pollution from traditional fossil fuel based energy production systems. Therefore, it is important to design sustainable and effective systems for biomass based energy production to provide competitive advantage on fossil fuel resourced systems. This study develops a novel optimization model to aid investment planning and strategic management of biomass based clean power generation systems. The model integrates the location, capacity and technology decisions to find the optimal combination of bioenergy production systems to meet electricity demand of particular regions and accounts for multiple biomass types and power technologies. The modelling approach and data analysis are presented to outline the important characteristics of the problem for minimization of the supply chain cost and minimization of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions simultaneously. To handle the multi objective problem efficiently, an integrated approach based on fuzzy decision making and ε-constraint method is proposed and used, considering both sustainability aspects and uncertainties in the system parameters. The viability of the proposed approach is explored on a case study of İzmir region in Turkey. Different supply chain configuration alternatives are provided for the case study region considering various weights for objective functions representing relative importance of each objective. Corresponding supply chain performance measures in terms of total cost and GHG emissions are proposed and discussed for each configuration alternative. Further enviro-economic analyses denote that discounted investment cost and GHG emissions associated with energy production activities receive the biggest shares in the total cost and in the total GHG emissions, respectively. The government and private investors can employ the model and solution algorithm to design the most cost effective and environment friendly supply chain, to monitor the economic and environmental performance of the current biomass based supply chains and identify policies to support a viable, profitable and eco-friendly energy industry.

AB  - Consensus reaching models are widely applied in group decision making problems to improve the group's consensus level before making a common decision. Within the context of the group Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a novel consensus reaching model in a dynamic decision environment is proposed. A Markov chain method can be used to determine the decision makers’ weights of importance for the aggregation process with respect to the group members’ opinion transition probabilities. The proposed group consensus reaching model facilitates a peer to peer opinion exchange process which relieves the group of the need for a moderator by using an automatic feedback mechanism. Moreover, as the elements in the group decision framework change in a dynamic decision making problem, this model provides feedback suggestions that adaptively adjust for each of the decision makers depending on his credibility in each round. The full process of the dynamic adaptive consensus reaching model is presented and its properties are discussed. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

AB  - Design concept evaluation is one of the most important phases in the early stages of the design process as it not only significantly affects the later stages of the design process but also influences the success of the final design solutions. The main objective of this work is to reduce the imprecise content of customer evaluation process and thus, improve the effectiveness and objectivity of the product design. This paper proposes a novel way of performing design concept evaluations where instead of considering cost and benefit characteristics of design criteria, the work identifies best concept which satisfy constraints imposed by the team of designers on design criteria’s as well as fulfilling maximum customers’ preferences. In this work, the rough number enabled modified Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method for design concept evaluation is developed by modifying the extended VIKOR method with interval numbers. The proposed technique is labeled as modified rough VIKOR (MR-VIKOR) analysis. The work primarily involves two phases of concept evaluation. In the first phase, relative importance ranking and initial weights of design criteria are computed through the importance assigned to each design criteria by the designers or the decision makers (DM); and in the second phase, customers’ preferences to the generated user needs are captured in the form of rough numbers. The relative importance ranking computed in first phase along with customers’ preferences is incorporated in the second phase to select the best concept.

AB  - The issue of trust is of exhilarating concern in case of information disseminated through websites. Digitization technologies such as Internet has lowered the cost and increased the access to information of all kinds. This increased exposure to information from humongous number of websites poses a need for some mechanism or tool that can address this issue and provide rankings to the websites on basis of their credibility or the trust value they possess. Previous research has shown a lot of efforts in this area. Both exogenous and endogenous signals have been evaluated to derive the credibility of websites. Trust being more of a sociological virtue of psychometric nature; cannot be quantified easily. Aiming this fact we have tried to measure the trust by evaluating the actual behavioral metrics of the users (of the websites) which gets collected by analytical tools automatically with every hit on a website. This gives a pertinent and bias-free quantification of trust value of a website as tools collect the data being anonymous from the user. In this paper, we have introduced our novel web-based tool which estimates trust (of websites) imposed by web metrics collected through similarweb.com. The tool will re-rank the web-links (URLs) extracted from Google search engine for any keyword according to the trust maintained by the actual users of the websites. We will also evaluate the performance of our tool in terms of validated rankings and benchmarking it with other recently acceptable tools.

AB  - The multivariate, layered nature of traffic accident analysis (TAA) determines that any TAA method must be categorized according to causational factors and encompass all four basic traffic elements, i.e. driver, vehicle, road and environment. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to sequence accident causation factors according to their relative importance, with the purpose of singling out the most influential ones. The Apriori algorithm is then applied to analyze the degree of an accident or the level of influence. Through applications, the method proves itself capable of determining the type and severity of accidents caused by multiple factors. The method also demonstrates improvement in the accuracy and efficiency of calculation in dealing with large data samples.

AB  - In the United States and elsewhere, climate change, peak oil, and other political and socioeconomic factors have spurred the development of alternate energy sources. Biofuels, derived from living organisms rather than petroleum-laden rock, are the focus of current energy research. To better understand the future composition and sustainability of biofuels within the U.S. energy portfolio the authors conducted an environmental scanning methodology and futures analysis. The authors developed a model representing the relationships between many important economic, environmental, political, and social factors to illuminate potential future trends in cellulosic and algal biofuel over the next twenty years. This innovative, flexible approach compared the sustainability of biofuel sources in many areas over time. The resulting analysis identifies environmental degradation as the most influential adverse factor. The environmental scanning exercise suggests that cellulosic biofuel may be a more sustainable option than algal biofuel under the model's assumptions. This analysis yields insightful trends that predict the sustainability of two biofuel sources over the next twenty years in relation to other important socio-politico-economic factors. In the future, this methodology can be applied to other biofuel sources and energy problems.

KW  - Airport performance
AB  - Currently, airports are expected to be operated as self-sufficient service organizations providing efficient and high-quality services to a variety of customers. In this context, improving airport service quality (ASQ) has become paramount. However, due to the complexity of the airport service environment, an effective process of measuring and analyzing passenger perceptions of ASQ is not easily achieved. Generic scales for perceived service quality might not cover some particularities of the passenger–airport interaction. Furthermore, while some measurement practices have been developed within the airport industry, there has been only limited consideration for validity and reliability. These concerns are certainly relevant to avoid misinterpreting passenger perceptions. In view of these concerns, this paper has a twofold objective. First, to fit a measurement model for perceived ASQ built on typical service measures within the airport industry. Second, to test for the model's equivalence across groups of passengers. Sample data from an extensive survey applied at a major Brazilian airport was used for confirmatory factor analysis. The results suggested that a six-factor structure provides a meaningful multi-item measurement model for perceived ASQ. The model was validated for international and domestic departing passengers with respect to its factorial structure and metric invariance. The proposed measurement model could be considered an alternative for a multidimensional approach in the context of airport performance measurement regarding service quality. Finally, the findings from this research might contribute to the discussion on passenger perceptions of ASQ, particularly concerning its multidimensionality and the need to review current practices for ASQ analysis.

AB  - Cell-load variation is considered as a major shortcoming in cellular manufacturing systems. It can cause long queues in front of machines and impose extra costs to the cellular layouts. In this paper the impact of inflation on cell-load variation in cellular manufacturing systems is examined. For this purpose, a new method is proposed for scheduling dynamic cellular manufacturing systems in the presence of bottleneck and parallel machines. The aim is finding the trade-off values between in-house manufacturing and using outsource services while system costs are not deterministic and may be varied from period to period by inflation. To solve the model, a hybrid genetic and simulated annealing algorithms is developed because of the high potential of outcomes to be trapped in the local optima. The results are then compared in LINGO® 12.0 software. In continue a Taguchi method (an L9 orthogonal optimization) is used to estimate parameters of the proposed method in order to solve experiments derived from literature. Our findings show that the condition of dynamic costs affects the routing of materials in process and may induce machine-load variation that yield to cell-load diversity. An increase in changing costs causes the loading level of each cell to vary, which in turn results in the development of “complex dummy sub-cells.” To measure the level of cell-load variation a new mathematical index is developed. Then, a new method is proposed for minimizing cell-load variation in the mentioned condition by using control lines. The results indicate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the level of cell-load variation in CMS.

AB  - Design space exploration and metamodeling techniques have gained rapid dominance in complex engineering design problems. It is observed that the modeling efficiency and accuracy are directly associated with the design space. In order to reduce the complexity of the design space and improve modeling accuracy, a multi-stage design space reduction and metamodeling optimization methodology based on self-organizing maps and fuzzy clustering is proposed in this paper. By using the proposed three-stage optimization approach, the design space is systematically reduced to a relatively small promising region. Self-organizing maps are introduced to act as the preliminary reduction approach through analyzing the underlying mapping relations between design variables and system responses within the original samples. GK (Gustafson & Kessel) clustering algorithm is employed to determine the proper number of clusters by utilizing clustering validity indices, and sample points are clustered using fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering method with the known number of clusters, so that the search can focus on the most promising area and be better supported by the constructed kriging metamodel. Empirical studies on benchmark problems with multi-humps and two practical nonlinear engineering design problems show the accurate results can be obtained within the reduced design space, which improve the overall efficiency significantly.

AB  - This paper presents a bi-objective mathematical programming model for the restricted facility location problem, under a congestion and pricing policy. Motivated by various applications such as locating server on internet mirror sites and communication networks, this research investigates congested systems with immobile servers and stochastic demand as M/M/m/k queues. For this problem, we consider two simultaneous perspectives; (1) customers who desire to limit waiting time for service and (2) service providers who intend to increase profits. We formulate a bi-objective facility location problem with two objective functions: (i) maximizing total profit of the whole system and (ii) minimizing the sum of waiting time in queues; the model type is mixed-integer nonlinear. Then, a multi-objective optimization algorithm based on vibration theory (so-called multi-objective vibration damping optimization (MOVDO)), is developed to solve the model. Moreover, the Taguchi method is also implemented, using a response metric to tune the parameters. The results are analyzed and compared with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) as a well-developed multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm. Computational results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed MOVDO to solve large-scale problems.

AB  - Scheduling involving no-wait in process plays an important role in industries such as plastic, chemical, and pharmaceutical. Moreover, many scheduling problems in other industries, including surgery-scheduling problem, aircraft landing problem, and train scheduling problem, can also be modeled with no-wait constraint. The research interest in scheduling problems with no-wait in process began in 1970s and the interest has been increasing since then. Hall and Sriskandarajah (1996) presented an excellent review of the literature, covering about 130 papers, on scheduling problems with no-wait in process since 1970s until mid-1993. This paper is the second survey paper providing analysis and an extensive review of more than 300 papers that appeared since the mid-1993 to the beginning of 2016. This survey paper classifies scheduling problems based on shop environments as flowshop, job shop, or open shop. It further classifies the problems based on the performance measure considered along with some other factors. Throughout the survey paper, many independently investigated problems are determined, less studied problems are identified, and suggestions for future research directions are proposed.

AB  - Heterogeneous parallel and distributed computing systems frequently must operate in environments where there is uncertainty in system parameters. Robustness can be defined as the degree to which a system can function correctly in the presence of parameter values different from those assumed. In such an environment, the execution time of any given task may fluctuate substantially due to factors such as the content of data to be processed. Determining a resource allocation that is robust against this uncertainty is an important area of research. In this study, we define a stochastic robustness measure to facilitate resource allocation decisions in a dynamic environment where tasks are subject to individual hard deadlines and each task requires some input data to start execution. In this environment, the tasks that cannot meet their deadlines are dropped (i.e., discarded). We define methods to determine the stochastic completion times of tasks in the presence of the task dropping. The stochastic task completion time is used in the definition of the stochastic robustness measure. Based on this stochastic robustness measure, we design novel resource allocation techniques that work in immediate and batch modes, with the goal of maximizing the number of tasks that meet their individual deadlines. We compare the performance of our technique against several well-known approaches taken from the literature and adapted to our environment. Simulation results of this study demonstrate the suitability of our new technique in a dynamic heterogeneous computing system.

AB  - With the major application of MMCs, it is thus necessary to develop an appropriate technology for their efficient machining. Milling is the most common and versatile technology among different machining processes, characterized by an extensive range of metal cutting capacity that places it in a central role in the manufacturing industries. In the present study an attempt has been made to find out the most optimal level of process parameters for CNC milling of Al–4.5%Cu–TiC metal matrix composites using grey-fuzzy algorithm. Taguchi's L25 orthogonal array design is used for performing CNC milling operation on the composite plates. The Grey fuzzy optimization of CNC milling parameters consist of three different output characteristics; such as, cutting force Fc, surface roughness Ra and surface roughness Rz. It was found that a cutting speed of 600 rpm, feed of 40 mm/min and a depth of cut of 0.30 mm is the optimal combination of CNC milling parameters that has produced a high value of grey fuzzy reasoning grade of 0.8191 which is close to the reference value. ANOVA analysis is carried out and it is found that among three different process parameters, the cutting speed played a major role on the determination of GFRG.

AB  - Biofuel as a promising pathway for substituting the traditional fossil fuels, mitigating environmental contaminations, and enhancing the energy security has attracted more and more attention in China. This study aims at identifying the critical success factors for promoting the sustainable development of biofuel industry and helping the stakeholders/decision-makers to draft the appropriate strategic measures for enhancing the sustainability of biofuel industry in China. A generic methodology in which the decision-makers are allowed to use linguistic terms to express their views and options, multiple decision-makers are allowed to participate in the decision-making, has been developed to prioritize the factors influencing the sustainability of biofuel industry and to identify the cause–effect relationships among these factors. The three factors, including government support degree, competitiveness, and local acceptability are identified as the most critical factors for promoting the sustainable development of biofuel industry in China, but they are all effects rather than the origins of the problems existed in the biofuel industry of China. In contrast, maturity, safety and reliability, complexity, conversion efficiency, and investment cost are the most important causes, and they are also the origins of the problems existed in the biofuel industry of China. Six effective strategic measures including popularizing the use of biofuels in large scales, subsidies and tax exemption policies, investing more on R&D on biofuel technologies, encouraging more private enterprises and joint ventures to participate in the biofuel industry, developing the integrated utilization manner of biofuels by further developing the byproducts of biofuels, and popularizing the use of biodiesel and bioethanol among the vehicle users through publicity and education have been proposed for promoting the sustainable development of China's biofuel industry according to the obtained results.

Such methods often require stakeholders such as developers and testers to specify preferences over multiple attributes/objectives that are to be optimized. However, in many cases it is more natural for stakeholders to express such preferences in simple, qualitative terms. We survey relevant literature within software engineering for problems in which qualitative optimization techniques can be useful. We also present a model of optimization that relies on the stakeholders qualitative preferences leveraging recent advances in decision theoretic artificial intelligence, which could prove useful and spawn connections between qualitative decision theory and software engineering.

AB  - Hinterland networks for container transportation require planning methods in order to increase efficiency and reliability of the inland road, rail and waterway connections. In this paper we aim to derive real-time decision rules for suitable allocations of containers to inland services by analysing the solution structure of a centralised optimisation method used offline on historic data. The decision tree can be used in a decision support system (DSS) for instantaneously allocating incoming orders to suitable services, without the need for continuous planning updates. Such a DSS is beneficial, as it is easy to implement in the current practice of container transportation. Earlier proposed centralised methods can find the optimal solution for the intermodal inland transportation problem in retrospect, but are not suitable when information becomes gradually available. The main contributions are threefold: firstly, a structured method for creating decision trees from optimal solutions is proposed. Secondly, an innovative method is used for obtaining multiple equivalent optimal solutions to prevent overfitting of the decision tree. And finally, a structured analysis of three error types is presented for assessing the quality of an obtained tree. A case study illustrates the method's purpose by comparing the quality of the resulting plan with alternative methods.

AB  - Supplier selection is a decision-making process to identify and evaluate suppliers for making contracts. Here, we use interval type-2 fuzzy values to show the decision makers’ preferences and also introduce a new formula to compute the distance between two interval type-2 fuzzy sets. The performance of the proposed distance formula in comparison with the normalized Hamming, normalized Hamming based on the Hausdorff metric, normalized Euclidean and the signed distances is evaluated. The results show that the signed distance has the same trend as our method, but the other three methods are not appropriate for interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Using this approach, we propose a hierarchical clustering-based method to solve a supplier selection problem and find the proximity of the suppliers. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed method, first a case study of supplier selection problem with 8 criteria and 8 suppliers are illustrated and next, an example taken from the literature is worked through. Then, to test the hierarchical clustering-based method and compare with the obtained results by two other methods, a comparative study using experimental analysis is designed. The results show that while the proposed hierarchical clustering algorithm provides acceptable results, it is also conveniently appropriate for using interval type-2 fuzzy sets and obtaining proximity of suppliers.

AB  - Commercialization of nanotechnologies entails a regulatory requirement for understanding their environmental, health and safety (EHS) risks. Today we face challenges to assess these risks, which emerge from uncertainties around the interactions of manufactured nanomaterials (MNs) with humans and the environment. In order to reduce these uncertainties, it is necessary to generate sound scientific data on hazard and exposure by means of relevant frameworks and tools. The development of such approaches to facilitate the risk assessment (RA) of MNs has become a dynamic area of research. The aim of this paper was to review and critically analyse these approaches against a set of relevant criteria. The analysis concluded that none of the reviewed frameworks were able to fulfill all evaluation criteria. Many of the existing modelling tools are designed to provide screening-level assessments rather than to support regulatory RA and risk management. Nevertheless, there is a tendency towards developing more quantitative, higher-tier models, capable of incorporating uncertainty into their analyses. There is also a trend towards developing validated experimental protocols for material identification and hazard testing, reproducible across laboratories. These tools could enable a shift from a costly case-by-case RA of MNs towards a targeted, flexible and efficient process, based on grouping and read-across strategies and compliant with the 3R (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) principles. In order to facilitate this process, it is important to transform the current efforts on developing databases and computational models into creating an integrated data and tools infrastructure to support the risk assessment and management of MNs.

AB  - Centralized clustering routing schemes promise significant network stability by centralized energy-efficient path planning that prominently share computational burden of monitoring devices of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Scalability and adaptiveness of WSNs present vital challenges for researchers to design a power-aware, well-organized routing schemes that can maintain centralized routing decisions and distributed data forwarding. Investigations on central cluster formation acknowledge the fact that higher computation and energy resources of Base Station (BS) are still required in specific network conditions and need more careful path planning to generalized their performance validity. In this paper, we propose two energy-efficient path planning routing protocols for three level heterogeneous WSNs namely, Two-Hop heterogeneity-aware Centralized Energy Efficient Clustering (THCEEC) and Advanced heterogeneity-aware CEEC (ACEEC). Both of these protocols are derived from Centralized Energy Efficient Clustering (CEEC) in different manner to deal with the fluctuation of network deployments and adoptive transmission range of WSNs. BS utilizes algorithms of THCEEC and ACEEC routing protocols to identify the suitable Cluster-Heads (CHs) by considering initial energy, residual energy, regional flag, and distance to BS. The proposed algorithms require intelligent distribution of energy resources evenly across the heterogeneous WSNs in initial stage of cluster formation. Extensive simulation results confirm the reliability and energy efficient performance enhancements of the centralized cluster formations of CEEC, ACEEC and THCEEC, which acquire better network lifetime and successful data forwarding as compared to the conventional distributed routing protocols of LEACH, SEP, ESEP, and DEEC. Furthermore, ACEEC outperforms CEEC and provides more network stability period. Analytical evaluation shows that THCEEC outperforms CEEC, ACEEC, and the other existing state of the art path planning routing protocols.

This new method involves the combination of transfer function modeling and fuzzy logic and was used in evaluating the six years performance of a brewery. Of the six years, the period 2010–2011 with a performance rating λ of 0.810 which corresponds to the linguistic variable ‘Good’ recorded the best performance while the period 2008–2009 with a performance rating λ of 0.381 which corresponds to the linguistic variable ‘Fair’ recorded the worst performance. The result of this study is expected to open new ways of improving maintenance effectiveness, utilization of raw materials and efficiency of multi input single output (MISO) production processes.

AB  - In Two-Stroke engines, the cylinder filling efficiency is antithetical to the cylinder scavenging efficiency; moreover, both of them are influenced by geometric and thermodynamic parameters characterizing the design and operation of both the engine and the related supercharging system. Aim of this work is to provide several guidelines about the definition of design and operation parameters for a Two-Stroke two banks Uniflow diesel engine, supercharged with two sequential turbochargers and an aftercooler per bank, with the goal of either increasing the engine brake power at take-off or decreasing the engine fuel consumption in cruise conditions. The engine has been modeled with a 0D/1D modeling approach. Then, the model capability in describing the effect of several parameters on engine performance has been assessed comparing the results of 3D simulations with those of 0D/1D model. The validated 0D/1D model has been used to simulate the engine behavior varying several design and operation engine parameters (exhaust valves opening and closing angles and maximum valve lift, scavenging ports opening angle, distance between bottom edge of the scavenging ports and bottom dead center, area of the single scavenging port and number of ports, engine volumetric compression ratio, low and high pressure compressor pressure ratios, air/fuel ratio) on a wide range of possible values. The parameters most influencing the engine performance are then recognized and their effect on engine thermodynamic behavior is discussed. Finally, the system configurations leading to best engine power at sea level and lowest fuel consumption in cruise conditions – respectively +42% and −7% with respect to baseline – have been determined implementing a multicriteria optimization procedure.

AB  - Cloud computing offers multiple benefits to users by offloading them of the tasks of setting up complex infrastructure and costly services. However, these benefits come with a price, namely that the Cloud Service Customers (CSCs) need to trust the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) with their data, and additionally being exposed to integrity and confidentiality related incidents on the CSPs. Thus, it is important for CSCs to know what security assurances the CSPs are able to guarantee by being able to quantitatively or qualitatively compare CSPs offers with respect to their own needs. On the other hand, it is also important for CSPs to assess their own offers by comparing them to the competition and with the CSCs needs, to consequently improve their offers and to gain better trust. Thus there is a basic need for techniques that address the Cloud security assessment problem. Although a few assessment methodologies have recently been proposed, their value comes only if they can be efficiently executed to support actual decisions at run time. For an assessment methodology to be practical, it should be efficient enough to allow CSCs to adjust their preferences while observing on the fly the current evaluation of CSPs' offers based on the preferences that are being chosen. Furthermore, for an assessment methodology to be useful in real-world applications, it should be efficient enough to support many requests in parallel, taking into account the growing number of CSPs and the variety of requirements that CSCs might have. In this paper, we develop a novel Cloud security assessment technique called Moving Intervals Process (MIP) that possesses all these qualities. Unlike the existing complex approaches (e.g., Quantitative Hierarchical Process – QHP) that are computationally too expensive to be deployed for the needed on-line real-time assessment, MIP offers both accuracy and high computational efficiency. Additionally, we also show how to make the existing QHP competitively efficient.

In keeping with recent calls for more research into the ‘realised’ impacts of multimethodology, we present a detailed account of an intervention to support the planning of business ideas by a management team working in a community development context. Drawing on the rich steam of data gathered during the intervention, we identify a range of cognitive, task and relational impacts experienced by the management team during the intervention. These impacts are the basis for developing a process model that accounts for the personal, social and material changes reported by those involved in the intervention. The model explains how the intervention's analytic and relational capabilities incentivise the interplay of participants’ decision making efforts and integrative behaviours underpinning reported intervention impacts and change. Our findings add much needed empirical case material to enrich further our understanding of the realised impacts of operational research interventions in general, and of multimethodology interventions in particular.

AB  - Supply chain planning and scheduling problems require manufacturers (project managers) to determine product configurations, select suppliers (contractors) for task allocation, and schedule project tasks while considering various production constraints among manufacturers and suppliers. Most relevant studies have focused on finding an optimal solution based on complete information provided by each enterprise in a supply chain. However, the practical implementation of complete information sharing is difficult, if not impossible, because of the fully distributed nature of the supply chain process. This work proposes an agent-based fuzzy constraint-directed negotiation (AFCN) model to solve problems associated with supply chain planning and scheduling, which are modeled as a set of fuzzy constraint satisfaction problems (FCSPs) that are interlinked via inter-agent constraints. To accommodate the perspectives and interests of each enterprise in a supply chain, conflicts among FCSPs are resolved using the AFCN protocol through the iterative exchange of offers/counter-offers with limited information sharing and without privacy breaches. A proposed offer/counter-offer represents not only a set of acceptable solutions and preferences for an operational task but also the possibility of conflict in this area. For each FCSP, the incremental process of offer/counter-offer evaluation eliminates redundant and infeasible solutions. The sharing of limited non-strategic sensitive information among agents enables them to elucidate their opponents’ intentions through iterative negotiations, such that the agents can reach an agreement while ensuring that the solution to a project planning and scheduling problem is satisfactory. The AFCN model is also sufficiently flexible to incorporate different negotiation strategies such as competitive, win-win, and collaborative strategies, for various production environments. Herein, a numerical study was conducted to examine the practical viability and effectiveness of the proposed AFCN model. The experimental results show that the proposed AFCN model not only can generate a schedule that is comparable to a near-optimal solution but also is time-efficient. This indicates that the proposed AFCN is a practical and effective method for solving supply chain planning and scheduling problems in fully distributed environments.

AB  - Among the different risks a manufacturing firm faces, one of the most devastating may be caused by internal fraud. Corporate Fraud Investigation Units receive dozens of reports about possible fraud allegations annually. While all allegations should be addressed, it is not possible to investigate all cases immediately due to resource limitations. However, fraud may cause serious production and financial losses at any stage in the supply chain. Thus, it is necessary to find a method to prioritize the fraud risk of cases for the purpose of allocating resources and to determine how quickly they must be addressed. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) stands out as the most widely used prioritization methodology due to its intuitive simplicity and mathematical rigor. This study combines current SCM risk frameworks with extant fraud investigation literature and best-practices to develop an AHP ratings model for the prioritization of alleged fraud reports in a corporate setting, more specifically in the context of a large metals and mining manufacturing company.

AB  - Software defect prediction predicts fault-prone modules which will be tested thoroughly. Thereby, limited quality control resources can be allocated effectively on them. Without sufficient local data, defects can be predicted via cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) utilizing data from other projects to build a classifier. Software defect datasets have the class imbalance problem, indicating the defect class has much fewer instances than the non-defect class does. Unless defect instances are predicted correctly, software quality could be degraded. In this context, a classifier requires to provide high accuracy of the defect class without severely worsening the accuracy of the non-defect class. This class imbalance principle seamlessly connects to the purpose of the multi-objective (MO) optimization in that MO predictive models aim at balancing many of the competing objectives. In this paper, we target to identify effective multi-objective learning techniques under cross-project (CP) environments. Three objectives are devised considering the class imbalance context. The first objective is to maximize the probability of detection (PD). The second objective is to minimize the probability of false alarm (PF). The third objective is to maximize the overall performance (e.g., Balance). We propose novel MO naive Bayes learning techniques modeled by a Harmony Search meta-heuristic algorithm. Our approaches are compared with single-objective models, other existing MO models and within-project defect prediction models. The experimental results show that the proposed approaches are promising. As a result, they can be effectively applied to satisfy various prediction needs under CP settings.

AB  - Recent efforts to emphasize social equity in transportation are emerging as local, regional and national governments have set initiatives to identify, existing and potential, disproportionate impacts to low-income and minority populations, also referred to as transportation justice (TJ). Currently, there are suggested methods for identifying transportation justice areas; however, there is no streamlined method instituted across transportation agencies. Each jurisdiction identifies transportation justice (or environmental justice) areas based on their own methodology, typically based on either average regional thresholds, graduated thresholds, or a more unique in-house index methodology. This research explores and evaluates existing methods and develops a rigorous and comprehensive method called the Transportation Justice Threshold Index Framework (TJTIF) using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as factors based on demographics, socio-economics, and transportation/land use. The framework is applied to a case study region in Pennsylvania reflective of the Marcellus Shale impact area, highlighting Sullivan County, PA. The methodology and the case study application serve as an example for how transportation agencies throughout the country can promote social sustainability and enhance transportation equity.

AB  - Strategic vendor selection problem (VSP) has been investigated in different purchasing literature during the last two decades. Indeed, senior purchasing managers always deal with such crucial decisions. Manufacturing managers in the global market are faced with challenging and complex tasks very similar to VSP. Increasing outsourcing and opportunity provided by automotive industry to the worldwide markets make these decisions, even more, complex. Various methodologies, from simple weighted scoring methods to complex mathematical programming models, are introduced to tackle the VSP. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a non-parametric method in operations research and economics for evaluating the productive efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs). This study utilizes the proposed approach in Toloo and Ertay (2014) to develop a method for finding the most cost efficient DMU when the prices are fixed and known. A case study of an automotive company located in Turkey is adapted from the literature to illustrate the potential application of the suggested approach.

AB  - Conflicts inevitably occur in major transport projects as various stakeholders express diverse, often conflicting needs and concerns, and failing to address and manage these conﬂicts often leads to project failures. Understanding stakeholders' perceptions and the discrepancies among them is crucial to an effective dialogue among the parties seeking to build consensus. This study investigates the potential influences of stakeholder characteristics as well as project environments on conflicts and consensuses in stakeholders' overall preferences about sustainable transport projects. Data on the perspectives of three stakeholder-group types (system providers, project designers, and system users) with regard to 14 sustainability criteria are drawn from a survey of eight major transport projects across China. Two-way analysis of variance is then carried out to investigate whether or not the differences in the mean scores among stakeholder-group types and cities were statistically significant. The results show that discrepancies of opinion about transport-project sustainability criteria prevail among stakeholder-group types in every region we studied, due to these types' different needs and concerns. Our findings also suggest that special attention should be given to cases in which multiple stakeholder groups assign the same priorities to certain criteria, as those criteria are likely to represent the most serious issues affecting all stakeholders in a given project environment. With regard to the potential influences of project environments, we found that, in general, the discrepancies in stakeholders' prior concerns about sustainability criteria exhibited no obvious geographic pattern. However, exceptions did occur when a specific criterion was of major concern in a given project environment. Taken together, our findings emphasize the necessity of addressing and managing specific local issues, and the divergent concerns of stakeholders, when planning sustainable-transport projects.

AB  - Although mining production depends on various equipments, significant amount of production loss can be attributed a specific equipment or fleet. Bottleneck is defined not only by production loss but also by our satisfaction from the equipment. The user satisfaction could be measured as machine effectiveness. Mining literatures on performance improvement and optimization of equipment operations assert importance of availability, utilization and production performance as key parameters. These three parameters are useful for evaluating effectiveness of equipment. Mine production index (MPI), which can represent the effect of these factors, has been applied for continuous operation in mining. MPI uses Fuzzy Delphi Analytical Hierarchy Process to determine importance of each three parameter for individual equipment. A case study in a Swedish open pit mine was done to evaluate the field application of MPI. The results reveal that crusher is the bottleneck equipment in studied mine. As a methodical approach, an algorithm which uses MPI and detects bottleneck in continuous mining operation has been proposed.

AB  - Unconventional emergency decision making not only involves intangible and conflicting criteria, but also needs a fast response to the emergency incident under the cases of time pressure and incomplete information. It might be an effective way to make full use of the outlier data of incident information and skip some direct comparisons between alternatives to make a fast emergency decision. Focusing on the missing judgments estimation issue in an incomplete comparison emergency decision matrix, this paper extends the geometric mean induced bias matrix to estimate the missing judgments and improve the consistency ratios at the same time. The least absolute error method and the least square method are used to optimize the revised geometric mean induced bias matrix and find the missing values. A numerical example with incomplete information is used to demonstrate the proposed models. A case of emergency decision making simulation is also conducted to show how the proposed model is applied in practice. The results show the proposed models are not only capable of completing missing values, but also can efficiently improve the matrix consistency at the same time. In addition, the proposed model can aid emergency managers to make a fast response to unconventional emergency in the case of lacking complete information.

AB  - Given the need for a quick response to today's dynamic market, the maintenance function is considered increasingly important for industrial companies. Waste elimination, in particular the reduction of work in process and overproduction, required by Lean Manufacturing methodology that has spread across industries, highlights and also increases the impact of failures or malfunctions of equipment on productivity. Managing maintenance involves several activities such as: planning of preventive maintenance actions; scheduling of activities considering available resources and planned production; management of spare parts; analysis of data to reduce the occurrence of failures and to improve performance of the maintenance function. To support this function, companies adopt information systems designated by computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) to provide timely and accurate information. Several CMMS are offered in market. However, its main drawback is that they do not perfectly match the particularities of each company. Thus, many companies prefer to develop their own system. This paper presents an ongoing project aiming to develop a CMMS for a manufacturing company. Crucial phases of the project, involving the identification of requirements and the specifications of the system, are described in detail, showing the approach that was followed and reflecting about its effectiveness and efficiency.

AB  - Objective
To highlight the use of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in geographical information system that incorporates environmental indices to generate dengue risk zonation area.
Methods
The medical database considered for the study was referenced to the environmental data layers. Factors related to the risk of dengue fever (DF) were selected throughout previous research and were arranged in a hierarchical structure. The relative weights of factors were calculated, which were within acceptable range with the consistency ratio being less than 0.1. The outcomes from AHP based DF risk zonation area produced useful information on different levels of risks.
Results
As a result, factor weights used in AHP were evaluated and found to be acceptable as the consistency ratio of 0.05, which was < 0.1. The most influential factors were found to be housing types, population density, land-use and elevation. Findings from this study provided valuable insights that could potentially enhance public health initiatives. The geographical information system and spatial analytical method could be applied to augment surveillance strategies of DF and other communicable diseases in an effort to promote actions of prevention and control. The disease surveillance data obtained could be integrated with environmental database in a synergistic way, which will in turn provide additional input towards the development of epidemic forecasting models.
Conclusions
This attempt, if successful, will have significant implications that could strengthen public health interventions and offers priorities in designing the most optimum and sustainable control program to combat dengue in Malaysia.

AB  - As a practical popular methodology for dealing with fuzziness and uncertainty in Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM), Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) has been applied to a wide range of applications. As of the time of writing there is no state of the art survey of FAHP, we carry out a literature review of 190 application papers (i.e., applied research papers), published between 2004 and 2016, by classifying them on the basis of the area of application, the identified theme, the year of publication, and so forth. The identified themes and application areas have been chosen based upon the latest state-of-the-art survey of AHP conducted by [Vaidya, O., & Kumar, S. (2006). Analytic hierarchy process: An overview of applications. European Journal of operational research, 169(1), 1–29.]. To help readers extract quick and meaningful information, the reviewed papers are summarized in various tabular formats and charts. Unlike previous literature surveys, results and findings are made available through an online (and free) testbed, which can serve as a ready reference for those who wish to apply, modify or extend FAHP in various applications areas. This online testbed makes also available one or more fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices (FPCMs) from all the reviewed papers (255 matrices in total). In terms of results and findings, this survey shows that: (i) FAHP is used primarily in the Manufacturing, Industry and Government sectors; (ii) Asia is the torchbearer in this field, where FAHP is mostly applied in the theme areas of Selection and Evaluation; (iii) a significant amount of research papers (43% of the reviewed literature) combine FAHP with other tools, particularly with TOPSIS, QFD and ANP (AHP’s variant); (iv) Chang’s extent analysis method, which is used for FPCMs’ weight derivation in FAHP, is still the most popular method in spite of a number of criticisms in recent years (considered in 57% of the reviewed literature).

AB  - The proper placement of soil and water conservation measures cannot be designated due to lack of appropriate technical prioritization of different areas of a watershed. Therefore, quantifying soil erosion hazard and spatial prioritization of sub-watersheds would aid in better watershed management planning. Although, many approaches have been applied to prioritize sub-watersheds, but still the efficient techniques like game theory have not been practically applied to prioritize sub-watersheds. The present study therefore has used the game theory to prioritize sub-watersheds in Gorganroud and Qareh Sou watersheds in Golestan Province, northern Iran. Towards this goal, 38 independent factors were classified in seven components using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method with one representative variable in each component. The Condorcet method used for prioritization of effective variables indicated that the percent of forestry lands (52 scores) and discharge with 10 years of return period (32 scores) were respectively the most and the least effective variables on sediment yield. The Fallback bargaining and the Borda Scoring algorithms were also selected to prioritize study sub-watersheds based on weighted grades of total score for each variable. Accordingly, the aforesaid algorithms classified sub-watersheds in three categories. Comparison of results similarly introduced Galikesh, Qazaqli, Gonbad, Siyah Ab and Tamar as first ranked sub-watersheds with the worth condition, Tangrah and Naharkhoran as second priority and eventually Pole Ordougah as sub-watershed with the lowest priority.

The important key energy factors for the evaluation of energy saving technologies and solutions are gathered through a literature survey. This paper proposes a framework based on the fuzzy Delphi method, fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making, including fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy techniques for order performance by similarity to ideal solution. In the fuzzy Delphi method step of the study, 17 key energy factors were selected from among a total of 40 energy factors and categorised into five groups. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process was used for the ranking of 17 key energy factors, and fuzzy techniques for order performance by similarity to ideal solution employed for ranking of the 10 biggest Iranian hotels in different provinces. The results of this study revealed that the first rank of main groups was equipment efficiency (0.403), system efficiency (0.225) had the second rank, third rank was related to reduction of heating and cooling demands (0.151) and energy management (0.091) and renewable energy (0.083) had the fourth and fifth ranks respectively. In the ranking weights of 17 sub-groups of energy saving technologies and solutions, the results of fuzzy analytic hierarchy process showed that efficient solutions for active space cooling (0.662) was as first rank, building insulation had the second rank with score (0.541) and third rank was European Eco-label for tourist accommodation service (0.532).

AB  - Stricter governmental regulations and rising public awareness of environmental issues are pressurising firms to make their supply chains greener. Partner selection is a critical activity in constructing a green supply chain because the environmental performance of the whole supply chain is significantly affected by all its constituents. The paper presents a model for green partner selection and supply chain construction by combining analytic network process (ANP) and multi-objective programming (MOP) methodologies. The model offers a new way of solving the green partner selection and supply chain construction problem both effectively and efficiently as it enables decision-makers to simultaneously minimize the negative environmental impact of the supply chain whilst maximizing its business performance. The paper also develops an additional decision-making tool in the form of the environmental difference, the business difference and the eco-efficiency ratio which quantify the trade-offs between environmental and business performance. The applicability and practicability of the model is demonstrated in an illustration of its use in the Chinese electrical appliance and equipment manufacturing industry.

AB  - Supplier selection is an important strategic decision in the context of supply chain management. Existing literature on the subject of supplier selection is focused on evaluating primary (e.g., cost, quality, lead time) and green (e.g., CO2 emission, environmental practices) criteria. However, the concept of supplier resilience has recently emerged due to advent of competitive and global supply chains (and the operational and disruptive risks to which they are exposed). Several resilience-based supplier selection criteria are developed with respect to absorptive, adaptive, and restorative capacities. This paper further proposes a Bayesian network (BN), a paradigm that effectively models the causal relationships among variables but that has not been used in the context of supplier evaluation and selection, to quantify the appropriateness of suppliers across primary, green, and resilience criteria. Some benefits of the BN paradigm, including an ability to handle expert evidence and to perform sensitivity and propagation analyses, are demonstrated with an initial illustrative example of three suppliers.

AB  - A multi-agent system based distributed EMS (energy management system) is proposed in this paper to perform optimal energy allocation and management for grids comprising of renewables, storage and distributed generation. The reliable and efficient operation of smart grids is slackened due to the presence of intermittent renewables. As the load demand and renewables are uncertain throughout the day, an energy management system is essential to ensure grid stability and achieve reductions in operation costs and CO2 emissions. The main objectives of the proposed algorithm is to maintain power balance in the system and to ensure long cycle life for storage units by controlling their SOC (state of charge). The proposed EMS scheme is tested and validated on a practical test system, which replicates a small-scale smart grid with a variety of distributed sources, storage devices, loads, power electronic converters, and SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system. This system is also connected to the utility grid and the power exchange is controlled with the help of a battery system through a fuzzy based decision-making framework. The proposed algorithm is also extensively verified and tested using a series of sensitivity analyses and benchmarking with existing algorithms.

AB  - The Tolleston Strandplain at the southern end of Lake Michigan offers a unique “dune and swale” topography supporting oak savannas on the dunes and a mosaic of wetland communities in the swales. Following years of human degradation, sites in this area are now being restored. In this effort, assessments of vegetative quality have been necessary for proper management decisions. However, it is poorly understood what indices best reflect the vegetative quality of these oak savannas and wetlands. A potential method for determining the best indices for these community types is to use metric benchmarks that employ expert best professional judgment (BPJ). In order to confirm the viability and consistency of BPJ for creating benchmarks, Kappa analysis was used to determine the level of agreement among seven experts. They placed each of 63 transects from this unique landscape into one of four quality categories: (1) “good to very good,” (2) “medium,” (3) “poor,” and (4) “very poor.” While experts had good agreement about the quality of severely degraded riverine wetlands, they had fair agreement when assessing the swales, and poor agreement when assessing the oak savannas. Using discriminant analysis, follow-up questions, and a comparison of each expert's quality categories with remnant oak savanna metrics, varying perspectives of quality also were discovered which may have influenced the experts’ assessments of the sites. Therefore, BPJ must be used with caution when creating metric benchmarks.

AB  - Lipids are an important and diverse group of naturally occurring organic compounds present in all biological entities. They play many essential roles in the survival of the organisms. Analysis of lipids is extremely complex due to their large variety of chemistries. In this work, we describe an innovative method for the characterization of the lipid composition in a complex and unknown vegetable oil: an extract of Kniphofia uvaria seeds; using Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC) coupled to Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI), High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) and UV detections. Thanks to the properties of supercritical CO2 allowing the use of a large number of chromatographic columns, an effective separation for this complex matrix was obtained.
Résumé
Les lipides sont un groupe important et divers de molécules naturelles organiques présent dans toutes les entités biologiques. Les lipides ont des rôles essentiels pour la survie des organismes. L’analyse des lipides est extrêmement complexe de par leur grande diversité chimique. Dans ce travail, nous décrivons une méthode innovante pour la caractérisation des lipides dans une huile végétale complexe et inconnue (un extrait de graines de Kniphofia uvaria) en utilisant la chromatographie en phase supercritique (CPS ou SFC) couplée à un spectromètre de masse (APCI-HRMS) et à un détecteur UV. Grâce aux propriétés du CO2 supercritique, il a été possible d’utiliser un grand nombre de colonnes chromatographiques reliées en série afin d’obtenir une séparation de grande qualité nécessaire à cette matrice complexe.

AB  - In Malaysia, end-of-life vehicles are not properly managed. Their number keeps growing, as reflected by the increasing number of produced and registered vehicles every year. Improper management of end-of-life vehicles endangers environment and social life in Malaysia. Excessive water, air and soil pollution are among the primary effects of improper end-of-life vehicle management. These negative impacts have led to an initiative to develop a framework for establishing end-of-life vehicle management system in Malaysia. A set of preliminary factors and underlying items have been identified from previous research efforts. Then, a large survey, with 300 respondents comprising of vehicle manufacturers and distributors, part dealers, and end-of-life vehicle collectors; and high response rate, was conducted. Responses of the survey were factor-analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20. As a result, the eight success factors namely management responsibility, performance management, capacity management, resource management, stakeholder responsibility, education and awareness, improvement and awareness, and cost management in implementing end-of-life vehicle management system in Malaysia and 33 underlying items are identified and thoroughly discussed. By conducting reliability analysis, all eight success factors are determined to be reliable. Linear relationship among the factors is then confirmed using structural equation modeling. Upon confirmation, the proposed framework containing factors and items, can be valuable for supporting authorities in establishing end-of-life vehicle management system not only in Malaysia, but also in other countries without proper end-of-life vehicle management system.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is to compare an emergent technology of manufacturing three-dimensional contoured thermoplastic sandwich structures with two technologies commonly used to produce similar components. The Life Cycle Engineering principles are applied to this case aiming at basing the selection on the economic and environmental life cycle performance of the alternatives. The approach integrates those two dimensions with an engineering perspective on technical and functional performance allowing to relate the product design and involved technology with the required resources and impacts generated. The analysis framework takes advantage of the use of process-based models endorsing sensitivity analysis of crucial technological, production and supply-chain parameters. The integration of functional, environmental and economic performance on a life cycle perspective in a single best-solutions space, for a specific business scenario, is a contribution to the methodology of life cycle engineering that fosters the adoption of more informed approaches in the manufacturing technologies selection.

AB  - The effect of variability in renewable input sources on the optimal design and reliability of an integrated energy system designed for off-grid mining operation is investigated via a two-stage approach. Firstly, possible energy system designs are generated by solving a deterministic non-linear programming (NLP) optimization problem to minimize the capital cost for a number of input scenarios. Two measures of reliability, the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and energy index of reliability (EIR), are then evaluated for each design based on the minimization of the external energy required to satisfy load demands under a variety of input conditions. Two case studies of mining operations located in regions with different degrees of variability are presented. The results show that the degree of variability has an impact on the design configuration, cost and performance, and highlights the limitations associated with deterministic decision making for high variability systems.

The first one consists of 14 instructors serving in the Computer Education and Instructional Technology (CEIT) Department of Firat University (FU). This group has supplied expert view in ranking the importance of the matters in the Presentation Evaluation Scale (PES) and in forming the rule base that sets ground for the operation of fuzzy logic mechanism. The second group consists of 41 juniors having the Operating Systems and Applications Course in the CEIT Department of FU. The students in this group make a presentation associated with the units of this course, PES are applied on them and the study is conducted by the data obtained from this scale. Frequencies and percentages and Wilcoxon test is used to analyze the data sets. It is found that there is a significant difference between the PES obtained student scores and those scores that passes through fuzzy logic mechanism. The scores of some students have decreased, those of some have increased while there is no significant change in some of them.

AB  - Cities contribute around 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. There is currently a massive growth in urban areas internationally, especially in developing countries. Urban centers and cities should offer an effective answer to new problems arising from planning and expansion, according to criteria of sustainability. Decisions for sustainable cities planning and management should be taken on an evaluation of their consequences. Correspondingly, each strategy should be designed and undertaken with the right tools of study, analysis and prediction. This paper aims to offer an analysis of the aspects involved in designing sustainable cities. It involves an overview of published papers focusing on urban transport, building energy consumption, green areas planning, waste management and water supply on a city-wide scale. In order to give a broader concept of sustainability in cities, an analysis of other variables from a social point of view is also given. The discussion of this research reflects that the adoption of mechanisms to promote sustainable development is a matter not only of decision makers and designers, but also of users and citizens.

The results provide an interesting starting point for a debate about what the expectations of younger generations are and what we can do to match them. The debate moves from the assessment of the importance of sustainability and well-being indicators and the relevance of perceived threats. Moreover, the results put the role of institutions (and in particular that of public schools) under scrutiny to develop the level of awareness and to promote knowledge transfer

AB  - Sustainability considerations in manufacturing scheduling, which is traditionally influenced by service oriented performance metrics, have rarely been adopted in the literature. This paper aims to address this gap by incorporating energy consumption as an explicit criterion in shop floor scheduling. Leveraging the variable speed of machining operations leading to different energy consumption levels, we explore the potential for energy saving in manufacturing. We analyze the trade-off between minimizing makespan, a measure of service level and total energy consumption, an indicator for environmental sustainability of a two-machine sequence dependent permutation flowshop. We develop a mixed integer linear multi-objective optimization model to find the Pareto frontier comprised of makespan and total energy consumption. To cope with combinatorial complexity, we also develop a constructive heuristic for fast trade-off analysis between makespan and energy consumption. We define lower bounds for the two objectives under some non-restrictive conditions and compare the performance of the constructive heuristic with CPLEX through design of experiments. The lower bounds that we develop are valid under realistic assumptions since they are conditional on speed factors. The Pareto frontier includes solutions ranging from expedited, energy intensive schedules to prolonged, energy efficient schedules. It can serve as a visual aid for production and sales planners to consider energy consumption explicitly in making quick decisions while negotiating with customers on due dates. We provide managerial insights by analyzing the areas along the Pareto frontier where energy saving can be justified at the expense of reduced service level and vice versa.

AB  - In pig production, surgical castration is primarily performed to avoid boar taint and for management purposes. The European Commission plans to end surgical piglet castration voluntarily by 2018. The aim of this study was to assess the opinions and attitudes of Spanish stakeholders from the entire pork chain regarding this plan. Two methodologies were used: focus groups with 26 participants (qualitative method) were conducted with representatives of farmers, the meat industry, government institutions, retailers (including butchers), HORECA and consumers, and 127 face-to-face surveys at butchers (quantitative method) were carried out. These include an analytical hierarchical process to assess the determining factors when purchasing fresh pig meat. The results showed that a potential end of pig castration in Europe is not anticipated to affect conventional pig production in Spain. However, butchers are worried of negative effects on high quality meat and meat products, where surgical castration of pigs plays an important role.

AB  - We consider the elicitation of incomplete preference information for the additive utility model in terms of linear constraints on the weights. Eliciting incomplete preferences using holistic pair-wise judgments is convenient for the decision maker, but selecting the best pair-wise comparison is difficult. We propose a framework for comparing holistic preference elicitation questions based on their expected information gain, and introduce a procedure for approximating the optimal question. We extend the basic approach to generate reference alternatives that differ on only a few attributes, and to determine when further preference information is unlikely to reduce decision uncertainty. We present results from computational experiments that assess the performance of the procedure and assess the impact of limiting the number of attributes on which the reference alternatives differ. The tests show that the proposed method performs well, and when implemented in a decision support system it may substantially improve on-line elicitation using pair-wise comparisons.

AB  - This study presents an approach based on Design of Experiment (DoE) technique for the optimization of an energy recovery ventilator (ERV). This system is one of the efficient ways to enhance the thermo-hygrometric comfort without increase excessively the thermal load in domestic kitchen. However, there is a major concern, which energy recovery cannot trade off ERV's fan power consumption. The goal of this study is to obtain the information about the relation between factors and response in an empirical way. This approach integrates three different levels of analysis: the virtual prototyping, Design of Experiment (DoE) and rapid prototyping. The virtual analysis allows to define the principal parameterization of a simplified model and to simulate the performance of each configuration at working condition. The proposed approach investigates the effect of the defined parameters and noise factor on the experimental results. In particular, the applied method for DoE analysis is based on virtual experiments in according to the necessity to reduce time and costs during the early design phase. The optimum parameters configuration, which is defined by the previous step, is useful to define the geometry and the working condition of a reliable virtual model. The final level is the realization of a 3D ERV with a rapid prototyping printer. The obtained component is now evaluable at the test bench to investigate the air flow rate and the electric power consumption.

As a result of these concerns, a trend of green and smart cities has been increasing. To respond to this increasing trend of smart cities with buildings every time more complex, in this paper we have proposed a new method to solve energy inefficiencies detection problem in smart buildings. This solution is based on a rule-based system developed through data mining techniques and applying the knowledge of energy efficiency experts. A set of useful energy efficiency indicators is also proposed to detect anomalies. The data mining system is developed through the knowledge extracted by a full set of building sensors. So, the results of this process provide a set of rules that are used as a part of a decision support system for the optimisation of energy consumption and the detection of anomalies in smart buildings.

AB  - Cinnarizine (CIN), a poorly soluble drug with erratic bioavailability due to pH dependent solubility has limited advantage to formulate oral solid dosage forms in subject having low gastric acidity. In present study precipitation-ultrasonication was used to fabricate nanosuspensions of cinnarizine stabilized by Poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) to enhance the bioavailability. We investigated the effects of PVA concentration (X1) and solvent to antisolvent ratio (X2) on the quality attributes like mean particle size (Y1); % drug content (Y2); and time required to 90% drug release (Y3) via 32 factorial design. The morphology of nanosuspensions was found almost spherical by SEM observation. DSC and FT-IR studies revealed lack of significant interactions between CIN and PVA. Nanosuspensions of mean particle size 621.08nm was achieved. The dissolution rate obtained from all formulations were markedly higher than pure CIN. Response surface methodology and optimized polynomial equations were used to select the optimal formulation i.e. 0.2% W/V of X1 and 1:42 of X2 to get the desired response Y1; 636.78nm, Y2; 95.24% and Y3; 7.09min that were in reasonable agreement with the observed value. The in-vivo study in rat demonstrated that Cmax and AUC0→12 values of nanosuspension were approximately 2.8-fold and 2.7-fold greater than that of reference preparation respectively.

AB  - Supplier selection is a very important decision for an enterprise to realize a sustainable production. However, almost all works, which concerned the environmental issues, focused on the supplier selection or evaluation methods, rather than an incentive mechanism to urge the participants to improve their decisions to reduce the harm to the environment. In this research, not only the commercial factors (price, quantity, and lead time), but also the environment factors (green factors and carbon dioxide emissions) of the suppliers are considered in order to reduce the harm to the environment (the carbon dioxide emissions and the use of the harmful materials). A product transportation distance is proposed for a product to record the transportation distance from the raw material to be a final product, and to be consumed by the consumers. It is used to calculate the carbon dioxide emissions during the whole processes of the product. An incentive mechanism is proposed to force the participants to make greener decisions to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions and use green materials. Numerical calculations are provided to verify the feasibility and the superiority of the proposed model.

A robust TOPSIS approach for assessing bank efficiency is also developed and presented. First, alternative variable reduction techniques are employed to extract the major factors within each CAMELS criterion. This is done to mitigate collinearity issues. Then, TOPSIS is used to measure bank performance based upon these factors, equally weighted. A comprehensive analysis based on a weighted linear optimization model for multi-criteria classification is also performed, which detects any discrepancies from the original scores. Lastly, censored quantile regressions are combined with bootstrapped TOPSIS scores to produce a model for predicting the impact of different contextual variables on different efficiency quantiles. Results reveal that the effects of ownership, trend, and origin of the bank may vary with respect to efficiency levels, whether high or low.

AB  - A product, or even a part, may contain hundreds of quality characteristics (QCs), but not all of them are key characteristics that determine product quality. Selecting possible key quality characteristics (KQCs), while eliminating redundant or noisy QCs, is a necessary step before implementing quality control or improvement tools. In this paper, we propose a two-phase variable selection algorithm based on a modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, and the ideal point method (IPM) for KQC selection. In modified NSGA-II, we use a modified fast non-dominated sorting approach to increase the diversity of population in the evolutionary process. The uniqueness of the algorithm is that IPM can select KQC sets with few QCs from the candidate QC subsets found by the modified NSGA-II. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmarked KQC selection algorithms in terms of classification accuracy rates and number of noisy or redundant QCs.

AB  - The literature concerning the evolution of the supply chain (SC) has highlighted that supply systems have undergone massive changes. The SC is a multi-objective system (economic, productive, strategic, environmental, social, etc.) crossed by a variety of flows (financial, material, information, technology, etc.). In such a complex system, the management of the processes of adoption, creation, storage, transfer, sharing and application of knowledge appears to be the necessary response to the new challenges posed to the SC by globalization and sustainability issues. This paper provides a systematic review of knowledge management (KM) in SCs in order to identify the state of the art in the literature, highlight research gaps, and define appropriate research questions to be addressed. To this end, eighty-two papers were selected and studied in detail. The paper shows that although there are a growing number of papers addressing KM in SC, many research issues are still neglected. In particular, the paper highlights eight main gaps in the SC literature. The first three gaps concern the factors affecting the adoption, creation, storage, transfer, sharing, and application of KM practices. The next three gaps address the systems to support knowledge management. The seventh gap considers the barriers to the adoption of KM practices. The eighth gap looks at the impact of adoption of KM practices on performance. Starting from these eight gaps, nine research questions have been formulated. These research questions represent possible areas of investigation to improve the body of knowledge in the field of KM in SC.

AB  - The software architectural decisions are crucial and critical to the success of a software project life cycle. The set of relevant design decisions affects the quality of the software architecture. In this paper, a systematic decision-making framework is proposed by considering management and organizational factors and design goals/parameters that affect software architecture (SA) and integrating it with the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to evaluate and select the quality software architecture. An illustrative case study is also mentioned to show the applicability of the proposed framework. The framework suggested in the paper should enable an architect and other key stakeholders of the software architecture to efficiently identify, evaluate and select the software architecture.

AB  - This paper deals with configuring manufacturing cells when product mix variation occurs. Most of researches have addressed the cell formation problem when part-machine incidence matrix is constant even for dynamic/stochastic case. But to the nature of CMS in manufacturing products in mid-variety and mid-volume, the product mix variation is not too far-fetched. Product mix variation causes the part-machine incidence matrix to change. To formulate the proposed problem two different criteria are considered which one relates to worker experts and another to worker relations. The first object considers the maximizing the expert levels in manufacturing cells. While the second object tries to maximize the interest levels in manufacturing cells. To make these concepts practical, a mathematical formulation which minimizes the voids of both worker-machine and worker-worker incidence matrices is developed. Due to the non-homogenous nature of the objective functions and possible conflicts, a bi-objective programming approach is applied. To find the Pareto-optimal front, the augmented ε-constraint method (AUGMECON) is applied. Since AUGMECON may not provide non-dominated set in a reasonable time, especially for large-size instances, NSGAII algorithm is customized and applied to produce optimal/near optimal Pareto solutions. To assess the performance of the proposed NSGAII algorithm, several randomly generated test problems were solved for a set of well-known multi-objective performance metrics.

AB  - In order to be competitive, small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) should focus, not only towards their performance in operational dimension, but they need to integrate the environmental dimension through the balanced adoption of lean and green paradigms simultaneously. Prior research indicates the positive impact of integrated lean and green paradigms on a firm's performance and competitiveness. This paper applies an analytical hierarchy process approach to investigate the impact of select lean and green practices on performance benefits, and to evaluate the influence of lean and green paradigms on overall performance of SMEs. Total productive maintenance is identified as the most important lean practice, while ISO 14001is the most significant green practice. On-time delivery and a reduction in emissions are the most critical criteria for leanness and greenness, respectively. Based on the dynamic sensitivity analysis of three AHP models, we propose bundles of lean and green practices to surmount the market challenges faced by SMEs. These results are used to develop an integrated framework for lean-green system to guide SMEs towards sustainable growth. The findings are expected to benefit policy makers and industrial practitioners of SMEs to focus on a few vital issues to facilitate both lean and green manufacturing implementation and assessment.

AB  - Fuzzy numbers and intuitionistic fuzzy numbers are introduced in the literature to model problems involving incomplete and imprecise information in expert and intelligent systems. Ranking of TrIFNs plays an important role in an information system (Decision Making) with imprecise and inadequate information and the complete ranking on the class of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy number is an open problem worldwide. Researchers from all over the world have been working in ranking of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers since 1985, but till date there is no common methodology that ranks any two arbitrary intuitionistic fuzzy numbers due to the partial ordering of TraIFNs. Different algorithms are available in the literature for solving intuitionistic fuzzy decision (or information system) problem, but each and every algorithm failed to give better result in some places due to the ranking procedure of TrIFNs. Intuitionistic fuzzy decision algorithm works better when it have a complete ranking procedure that ranks arbitrary intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. In this paper a linear (total) ordering on the class of trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers using axiomatic set of eight different scores is introduced. The main idea of this paper is to classify and study the properties of eight different sub classes of the set of TrIFNs. Further new total order relations are defined on each of the subclasses of TrIFNs and they are extended to a complete ranking procedure on the set of TrIFNs. Finally the significance of the proposed method over existing methods is studied by illustrative examples.

AB  - This paper presents a quadratic-program-based framework for group decision making with incomplete intuitionistic preference relations (IPRs). The framework starts with introducing a notion of additive consistency for incomplete IPRs, followed by a two-stage quadratic program model for estimating missing values in an incomplete IPR. The first stage aims to minimize inconsistency of the completed IPR and control hesitation margins of the estimated judgments within an acceptable threshold. The second stage is to find the most suitable estimates without changing the inconsistency level. Subsequently, a parameterized formula is proposed to transform normalized interval fuzzy weights into additively consistent IPRs. Two quadratic programs are developed to generate interval fuzzy weights from a complete IPR. The first model obtains interval fuzzy weight vectors by minimizing the squared deviation between the two sides of the transformation formula. By optimizing the parameter value, the second model finds the best weight vector based on the optimal solutions of the first model. A procedure is then developed to solve group decision problems with incomplete IPRs. A numerical example and a group selection problem for enterprise resource planning software products are provided to demonstrate the proposed models.

The goal of this study is to develop and analyze three scenarios in the Zayandehrud river basin in Iran using a model already built and calibrated by Safavi et al. (2015) that has results for the baseline scenario. Results from the baseline scenario show that water demands will be supplied at the cost of depletion of surface and ground water resources, making this scenario undesirable and unsustainable. Supply Management, Demand Management, and Meta (supply and demand management) scenarios are the selected scenarios in this study. They are to be developed and declared into the Zayandehrud model to assess and evaluate the imminent status of the basin. Certain strategies will be employed for this purpose to improve and rectify the current management policies. The five performance criteria of time-based and volumetric reliability, resilience, vulnerability, and maximum deficit will be employed in the process of scenario analysis and evaluation. The results obtained from the performance criteria will be summed up into a so-called ‘Water Resources Sustainability Index’ to facilitate comparison among the likely trade-offs. Uncertainties arising from historical data, management policies, rainfall-runoff model, demand priorities, and performance criteria are considered in the proposed conceptual framework and modeled by appropriate approaches. Results show that the Supply Management scenario can be used to improve upon the demand supply but that it has no tangible effects on the improvement of the resources in the study region. In this regard, the Demand Management scenario is found to be more effective than the water supply one although it still remains unacceptable. Results of the Meta scenario indicate that both the supply and demand management scenarios must be applied if the water resources are to be safeguarded against degradation and depletion. In other words, the supply management scenario is necessary but not adequate; rather, it must be coupled to the demand management scenario. Finally, it will be shown that applying the Meta scenario will improve the water resources from sustainably.

AB  - Rough set theory and Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence are two distinct but closely related approaches to modeling and manipulating uncertain information. It is quite natural to set up a hybrid model based on these two theories. In this paper, we investigate the problem of attribute reduction for ordered decision tables based on evidence theory. Belief and plausibility functions, which are strongly connected with lower and upper approximation operators in dominance-based rough set approach, are proposed to define relative belief and plausibility reducts of ordered decision tables. Relationships among various types of relative reducts are thoroughly studied in consistent and inconsistent ordered decision tables. A pair of numeric measures, the inner and outer significance measures of a criterion, is presented to search for a relative belief/plausibility reduct, which is meaningful for practical problems. Some real-world tasks taken from the UCI repository are employed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed technique.

AB  - Second-generation biodiesel production from non-edible high oil content feedstocks such as Jutropha curcas L. (JCL) has been found as a suitable alternative for the fossil diesel which is mostly consumed in transportation sector. Second-generation biodiesel eliminates the drawbacks of the first generation such as food-energy challenge and provides opportunity for rural development. Location optimization of JCL plays a vital role in the success and prosperity of JCL projects. In this study, sustainability and ecological indicators are defined to evaluate the performance and efficiency of the candidate locations for JCL cultivation under uncertainty. The values of defined indicators are highly tainted with uncertainty in real-life situation. To optimize the candidate locations for JCL cultivation under uncertainty, an efficient Unified Fuzzy Data Envelopment Analysis (UFDEA) model is developed. The proposed UFDEA model is verified and validated through investigating a real case study in Iran and the associated results are compared to those obtained by the crisp Unified Data Envelopment Analysis model under different levels of uncertainty. The obtained results show the applicability of the proposed UFDEA model in selecting suitable areas for JCL cultivation under uncertainty.

AB  - This paper presents a new index of disagreement (or measure of consensus) for comparison of data collected using Likert items. This new index, which assesses the level of disagreement among group members, exploits the conditional distribution of the variance for a given mean. The variance is often used as a measure of disagreement, with high variance seen as a high disagreement in a group. However, since the range of the variance is a function of the mean, this implies that for a mean close to the end points of the scale, the range of the variance is relatively small and for a mean at the center of the scale the range of the variance is larger. The index of disagreement introduced in this paper takes into account both the mean and the variance and provides a way to compare two groups that is more meaningful than just considering the variance or other measures of disagreement or consensus that only depend on the variance.

AB  - In the present work, the performance of a refrigerant-to-air multi-pass louvered fin-and-flat tube condenser is optimized without changing the condenser dimensions include length, width and depth. In order to achieve this aim, a one dimensional finite element model is developed to predict the condenser performance. The developed model is then used for optimization procedure after validating by the experimental data. The modified NSGA-II approach is applied to maximize heat transfer rate (Q) and minimize entropy generation number (Ns), refrigerant pressure drop (ΔPref) and air pressure drop (ΔPair) as the objective functions. The non-dominated optimum design points are then plotted and trade-off optimum points are obtained using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Nearest to the Ideal Point (NIP) method. Comparing the results of four-objective optimization with the results of separately run three and two-objective optimization problems reveals that Q and Ns can be used interchangeably. An independent two-objective optimization of Q and ΔPref results in heat transfer rate increase of about 4% and refrigerant pressure drop reduction of about 85%. In addition, the calculations show that in this case the effectiveness of the optimized condenser increases 3.3% in comparison with the base line condenser. Also, the results of sensitivity analysis of change in the optimum heat transfer rate and refrigerant pressure drop with change in the decision variables are reported.

AB  - Optical flow methods are among the most accurate techniques for estimating displacement and velocity fields in a number of applications that range from neuroscience to robotics. The performance of any optical flow method will naturally depend on the configuration of its parameters, and for different applications there are different trade-offs between the corresponding evaluation criteria (e.g. the accuracy and the processing speed of the estimated optical flow). Beyond the standard practice of manual selection of parameters for a specific application, in this article we propose a framework for automatic parameter setting that allows searching for an approximated Pareto-optimal set of configurations in the whole parameter space. This final Pareto-front characterizes each specific method, enabling proper method comparison and proper parameter selection. Using the proposed methodology and two open benchmark databases, we study two recent variational optical flow methods. The obtained results clearly indicate that the method to be selected is application dependent, that in general method comparison and parameter selection should not be done using a single evaluation measure, and that the proposed approach allows to successfully perform the desired method comparison and parameter selection.

AB  - We consider the problem faced by a company that must outsource reverse logistics (RL) activities to third-party providers. Addressing RL outsourcing problems has become increasingly relevant issue in the management science and decision making literatures. The correct evaluation and ranking of the decision criteria/priorities determining the selection of the best third-party RL providers (3PRLPs) is essential for the competitive performance of the outsourcing company. The method proposed in this study allows to identify and classify these decision criteria. First, the relevant criteria and sub-criteria are identified using a SWOT analysis. Then, Intuitionistic Fuzzy AHP is used to evaluate the relative importance weights among the criteria and the corresponding sub-criteria. These relative weights are implemented in a novel extension of Mikhailov's fuzzy preference programming method to produce local weights for all criteria and sub-criteria. Finally, these local weights are used to assign a global weight to each sub-criterion and create a ranking. We discuss the results obtained by applying the proposed model to a case study of a real company. In particular, these results show that the most important priority for the company when delegating RL activities to 3PRLPs is to focus on the core business, while reducing costs constitutes one of its least important priorities.

AB  - In Business Process Management great attention is given to Computational Intelligence for supporting process life-cycle. Several approaches have been defined to support human decision making. The main drawback is that there are no solid criteria for determining optimal decisions since context, matter of discussion, and involved actors may differ at each execution. This work focuses on the definition of a framework to support and trace human decision making activities, in business processes, when heterogeneous decision-makers have to find a consensus to select most promising alternative to follow. The framework relies on Fuzzy Consensus Model and implements Reinforcement Learning algorithm to learn weight of the decision-makers through the analysis of past process executions considering context and performances of business processes. Context awareness relies on semantic web technologies enabling ontological reasoning to evaluate context similarity used to assign the right weight to the involved decision-makers also in the case when more general or more specific context occurs. The framework has been instantiated in the case study of Supply Chain Management. The analysis of the simulation results reveal that the proposed weight learning algorithm and the considered initial weight association strategies (Starting Weight and Training Executions), even if the cold start, give to decision-makers the chance to fill the gap with respect to more experienced decision makers.

AB  - Industries face significant pressures to enact eco-friendly practices in their supply chain due to the constraints of natural resources and growing ecological awareness among customers. Reverse logistics (RL) has been considered as a systematic approach for industries to improve their environmental impacts and to ensure sustainability in business. Industries are enthusiastic to adopt RL activities in their businesses, but they also face challenges such as insufficient knowledge and resources regarding RL implementation. Therefore, we seek to evaluate the critical success factors (CSFs) linked to the implementation of RL in manufacturing industries in India. In this work, a structural model is proposed by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to evaluate the CSFs in RL adoption. The AHP methodology assists in establishing the priorities of the CSFs, while the DEMATEL approach categorizes the causal relationships among them. The findings of this work shows that the Global competitiveness main factor is highly prioritized, and thus, needs to be focused greatly in order to increase the effectiveness of RL adoption in business. The relative priority of the remaining main factors through AHP analysis is given as Regulatory factors - HR and organizational factors -Economic factors - Strategic factors. The findings also indicate that Global competitiveness; Regulatory; HR and organizational main factors are classified under cause group, while Economic and Strategic main factors belong to effect group. This model will help business analysts and supply chain managers formulate both short-term and long-term, flexible decision strategies for successfully managing and implementing RL adoption in the supply chain scenarios.

AB  - Hardfacing is one of the most efficient and cost-effective ways to scale down operating expense leading to improved performance and reliability of the equipment. Presence of nano-particles in hard facing metal matrix dramatically enhanced surface area to volume ratio resulting in magnificent improvement in conductivity, hardness, heat and wear resistant properties. This paper presents an application of nanostructured hardfacing material for the development of turning tool insert through welding and machining by WEDM process. In order to simultaneously optimize performance characteristics (MRR, machining time and surface roughness), a novel hybrid approach combining grey relational analysis with principal component analysis has been proposed to identify the optimal combination of process parameters in WEDM for machining nanostructured hardfacing materials. The grey relational analysis manifests discharge pulse time a most important parameter for both brass and zinc coated brass wires. Further, mathematical models are developed using response surface methodology to investigate the effects of the WEDM parameters on grey relational grade. As subsequent comparison made in terms of performance characteristics amongst brass and zinc coated brass wire, it is observed that zinc coated brass wire is highly worthy of being chosen especially for machining of nanostructured hardfacing material.

AB  - Nowadays human capital can be considered as the main asset of any organization. Companies need to invest in order to ensure the growth and survival of these assets. Therefore, the effective human resources strategies will be required in this regard. Business strategies may be influenced by human resources factors. Human resources strategies are effective by operating business strategies. Thus, to examine the methods of integrating of human resources and business strategies, it is necessary to achieve to organizational goals and develop human resource. Therefore, the most important measures for selecting the human resources strategy and an overall business strategy were identified through checking lists, experts’ opinions, and previous studies. A questionnaire was used as a main instrument to classify the key measures using Delphi method in multiple step studies and an acceptable convergence. Finally, the combination of the SWOT analysis and Fuzzy TOPSIS analysis were used for indentifying the organizational environment and ranking the available organizational strategies. The model has high performance because of different combined methods.

AB  - Habitually, decision-makers are exposed to situations that require a lot of knowledge and expertise. Therefore, they need tools to help them choose the best possible alternatives. Analytic hierarchical process (AHP) is one of those tools and it is widely used in many fields. While the use of AHP is very simple, there is a situation that becomes complex: the consistency of the pairwise matrices. In order to obtain the consistent pairwise matrix from the inconsistent one, reconstruction methods can be used, but they cannot guarantee getting the right matrix according to the judgments of the decision maker. This situation does not allow proper evaluation of methods reliability, i.e. it is not possible to obtain a reliable ranking of alternatives based on an inconsistent matrix. In this work, a new way to evaluate the reliability of matrix reconstruction methods is proposed. This technique uses a novel measure for alternatives ranking comparison (based on element positions and distances), which is introduced in order to compare several matrix reconstruction methods. Finally, in order to demonstrate the extensibility of this new reliability measure, two reconstruction methods based on bio-inspired models (a Genetic Algorithm and the Firefly Algorithm) are presented and evaluated by using the aforementioned reliability measure.

AB  - Because of their higher processing priority, hot lots often interrupt the production of regular lots in a Thin-Film-Transistor Liquid-Crystal Display (TFT-LCD) fab. As a result, how to manage the production of hot lots so that their production demand can be met and their negative effects on regular lots minimized is a very important issue. In this paper, we identity three problems – the lot selection of interbay AGVs, the lot selection of intrabay machines, and the photo bay selection of lots – that can affect the production of hot lots and regular lots and propose methods for them. A fuzzy-based dynamic bidding (FBDB) method is proposed for the first two problems. The bidding functions in this FBDB method consider several attributes of the current system to obtain the true values of bids. An earliest possible time (EPT) method that also considers several attributes of the current system is proposed for the third problem. These two methods are compared with methods used by a Taiwanese TFT-LCD fab through computer simulations. The effects of hot lot ratios on the performance of these methods are also analyzed. Six performance measures are adopted to measure the throughput and tardiness performance of all lots, regular lots and hot lots. The simulation results show applying the FBDB and EPT methods to the three problems studied here can result in very good results in all performance measures.

AB  - Buildings consume about 40% of the overall energy consumption, worldwide and correspondingly are also responsible for carbon emissions. Since, last decade efforts have been made to reduce this share of CO2 emissions by energy conservation and efficient measures. Scientist across the world is working on energy modeling and control in order to develop strategies that would result in an overall reduction of a building׳s energy consumption. Development of control strategies asks for a computationally efficient energy model of a building under study. This paper presents a review of all the significant modeling methodologies which have been developed and adopted to model the energy systems of buildings. Attention is majorly focused on the works which involved development of the control strategies by modeling the building energy systems. Models reviewed are presented categorically as per the modeling approach adopted by the researchers. Simulation programs and softwares available for building energy modeling are also presented.

AB  - Agents act in open and thus risky environments with limited or no human intervention. Making the appropriate decision about who to trust in order to interact with is not only necessary but it is also a challenging process. To this end, trust and reputation models, based on interaction trust or witness reputation, have been proposed. Yet, they are often faced with skepticism since they usually presuppose the use of a centralized authority, the trustworthiness and robustness of which may be questioned. Distributed models, on the other hand, are more complex but they are more suitable for personalized estimations based on each agent's interests and preferences. Furthermore, distributed approaches allow the study of a really challenging aspect of multi-agent systems, that of social relations among agents. To this end, this article proposes DISARM, a novel distributed reputation model. DISARM treats Multi-agent Systems as social networks, enabling agents to establish and maintain relationships, limiting the disadvantages of the common distributed approaches. Additionally, it is based on defeasible logic, modeling the way intelligent agents, like humans, draw reasonable conclusions from incomplete and possibly conflicting (thus inconclusive) information. Finally, we provide an evaluation that illustrates the usability of the proposed model.

The paper describes each phase of DLCs design process, from early daylight availability evaluations to system installation and calibration, and highlights reasons that limit their spread.

AB  - In order to make accurate energy predictions for large-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems connected to a smart grid, it is first necessary to identify the very specific locations that are required for their long-term optimal operation. Multi-criteria evaluation techniques are often applied for different site selection studies. This study discusses the past, present and future condition of solar PV application in Malaysia. The study also uses the optimal site definition model (ODM) and GIS to select sites for the installation of large-scale PV power plants that will be connected to a smart grid, and to predict their technical potential and carbon emission reduction, based on optimal sites in Peninsular Malaysia. The outcome of the study reveals that policies and strategies being adopted by Malaysia government are significantly improving the solar PV application for energy sustainability. However, on the other aspect, the results show that 10,092.08km2 (7.64%) of the area under study is suitable for large-scale PV plant installation. If even half of the potential sites are used, with an installed capacity of 756.91GW, we predict a total electricity generation potential of 1,343,527.9 GWh/yr with an annual carbon emission reduction of 846,422.56kt-CO2/yr in Peninsular Malaysia. Based on predicted national energy consumption in 2030, this study shows that about 8 times future annual energy consumption could be met if PV plants with an installed capacity of 756.91GW are set up in Peninsular Malaysia. Similarly, the study predicts an improvement of 1.6 times the annual carbon emission reduction, based on predicted carbon emissions for 2020. Therefore, the implementation of large-scale PV applications is technically and environmentally viable in Peninsular Malaysia and tropical countries as a whole.

AB  - Information is a perennially significant business asset in all organizations. Therefore, it must be protected as any other valuable asset. This is the objective of information security, and an information security program provides this kind of protection for a company's information assets and for the company as a whole. One of the best ways to address information security problems in the corporate world is through a risk-based approach. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of security risk assessment drawn from 125 papers published from 1995 to May 2014. Organizations with different size may face problems in selecting suitable risk assessment methods that satisfy their needs. Although many risk-based approaches have been proposed, most of them are based on the old taxonomy, avoiding the need for considering and applying the important criteria in assessing risk raised by rapidly changing technologies and the attackers knowledge level. In this paper, we discuss the key features of risk assessment that should be included in an information security management system. We believe that our new risk assessment taxonomy helps organizations to not only understand the risk assessment better by comparing different new concepts but also select a suitable way to conduct the risk assessment properly. Moreover, this taxonomy will open up interesting avenues for future research in the growing field of security risk assessment.

AB  - This paper describes the City Energy Analyst (CEA), a computational framework for the analysis and optimization of energy systems in neighborhoods and city districts. The framework allows analyzing the energy, carbon and financial benefits of multiple urban design scenarios in conjunction to optimal schemes of distributed generation. For this, the framework integrates time-dependent methods for building energy performance simulation, conversion and storage technologies simulation, assessment of local energy potentials, bi-level energy systems optimization and multi-criteria analysis. Based on past research, the framework introduces a novel interface to facilitate the spatiotemporal analysis of patterns of demand and potential infrastructure solutions. The model was programmed in Python v2.7 and built as an extension of the Geographic Information System ArcGIS v10.3, which serves as a platform for the allocation and future dissemination of spatiotemporal data. We present an application of the model for a downtown area in Switzerland where we evaluated four trajectories of development and found optimum infrastructure solutions for their operation. For a more holistic approach we used the 2000-W/1-t CO2 society vision concept to compare the environmental performance of these solutions with that of embodied energy in buildings and transportation systems. From the optimization process, most infrastructure solutions showed an average integration of 50% to 80% of buildings in thermal micro-grids, 50 to 100% of the available solar potential, and a resource mix consisting of photovoltaic electricity and sources of waste and ambient heat. For a balanced distribution of social, environmental and economic criteria, the results showed potential relative savings in the area from 45% to 60% in emissions and from 25% to 50% in primary energy at an annualized cost between 14% and 44% higher than today. For an economic-driven distribution, the results showed savings of up to 23% in emissions, 36% in primary energy and 11% in costs. We identified close to 15% in emissions and 20% in primary energy savings with variable costs between −2% and 23% in the area are strongly related to the urban design option rather than to its optimal energy system. In comparison to local benchmarks, the environmental impact of buildings during operation lies between that of embodied energy in buildings and mobility in the service sector (business flights). We estimated that an increase in close to 4% of today's average efficiency of photovoltaic technology would allow the area to comply with those local benchmarks. On the other hand, we concluded the suitability of the City Energy Analyst (CEA) to assist urban planning authorities looking for both design and engineering options to increase the performance of their neighborhoods and city districts.

AB  - The need to address the global challenge of using clean energy, mitigating climatic changes and favoring sustainable development, has promoted the diffusion of new technologies for the use of renewable energy resources. Geothermal technologies can generate electricity and/or heating and cooling while producing very low levels Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and therefore play an important role in realizing these targets. In particular, low temperature applications have known a great development over the last years, thanks to the larger availability, compared to high temperature traditional ones, and to the increasing cooling demand that is also related to the global warming. A sustainable and profitable use of low enthalpy geothermal resources is strictly related to a correct analysis of ground thermal response to energy extraction/injection: in fact, sizing methodologies and optimization strategies are based on a balance of plant׳s energy demand and predictions of ground thermal variations due to these energy requirements. Therefore, an accurate mathematical modeling of thermo-dynamic behavior of the ground is fundamental for optimal design of geothermal plants for two reasons: it is the basis for the estimation of ground thermo-physical properties from the analysis of the Thermal Response Test, and it is essential in order to predict hour by hour (or short term) responses of the ground to continuously changing energy loads and therefore to estimate system energy consumption. Besides, there is a great interest in modeling thermo-fluid dynamic phenomena which occur in geothermal wells and geothermal heat exchangers as these can significantly affect the performance of the whole system. In this work, the numerical models that are currently available for simulation of the thermo-fluid dynamic phenomena occurring in low enthalpy geothermal energy systems are analyzed, underlying the main differences and recent advances in modeling approaches.

AB  - The ecosystem services framework provides a holistic perspective for planning on local, national, and global scales. Often, scenarios are utilized to quantify and contrast the potential impacts of anthropocentric or climatic drivers of change on ecosystem services. One freely available modeling suite, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST), from the Natural Capital Project, aims to aid in decision making and planning processes by quantifying ecosystem services in spatially explicit context. Several of their modeling tools require land cover data layers, and the user can generate future land cover data layers through the scenario generator tool, released in 2014. The tool’s associated literature emphasizes the integration of stakeholders into the scenario generating process to help create plausible and relevant scenarios, often through workshops. Our study reviews the tool and presents an alternative methodology for engaging expert stakeholders in the scenario generation process through a less time intensive format than the recommended workshops—a detailed questionnaire. We find that there is a need for systematic decision making analysis of stakeholder input before scenarios can be created, and we used cumulative percent frequency analysis of questionnaire responses to dictate scenario generation transition tables, when appropriate. We conclude that using a questionnaire to elicit input from expert stakeholders to develop land cover scenarios may be a time and cost effective alternative that still provides realistic and usable inputs when compared to workshops.

AB  - This paper contributes to the discussion on involving stakeholders in ecosystem services (ES) assessments and contributes to the practice of integrated ES assessments through introducing the “images of nature” concept. An inductive analysis of stakeholders’ notions of nature, their use of nature and the perceived importance of ES functioning in their municipality generated a two-dimensional images of nature valuation framework. The first dimension describes a Nature versus Culture continuum. The second dimension refers to the Nature-Humankind relationship, including three relations: Nature and Landscape for People, People for Nature and Landscape and an Imbalanced relation. We discuss the potential of the images of nature concept as a boundary object for participatory integrated ES assessment, planning and management. We situate the emerged images of nature within traditional approaches to human-nature relations. Based on our observations, we challenge the ES concept and ES typology, and plea for an integrated ES assessment framework incorporating social, economic and biophysical perspectives. We finish with outlining how images of nature can be a tool within participatory integrated ES assessments.

AB  - The rapid evolution in mobile wireless communication networks has generated Heterogeneous Wireless Networks (HWNs), which cover a diverse range of networks (e.g., 2G, 3G, and LTE-A). In HWNs, a mobile device supports multiple network interfaces that use different access methods for wireless links. In such an environment, the main challenge is Always Best Connected (ABC), which means that the mobile nodes rank the network interfaces and select the best one at anytime and anywhere according to multiple criteria (application-related criteria, network-related criteria, terminal-related criteria, user-related criteria). In this context, Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) techniques present a promising solution for the network interface selection problem. The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is one widely adopted MADM method. TOPSIS suffers from ranking abnormalities, e.g., if a low-ranking network (alternative) is disconnected or a new network is discovered, then the order of the higher-ranking networks will change abnormally. These abnormalities can potentially decrease the quality of the results. In this paper, we propose new TOPSIS-based approaches for network interface selection that efficiently tackle the ranking abnormality problem in HWNs. The performance of our methods is evaluated through simulations. The results show that the proposed approaches reduce or completely eliminate the rank reversal, either when networks are disconnected or new networks are connected.

AB  - Efficient HVAC devices are not sufficient to achieve high levels of building energy performance, since the regulation/control strategy plays a fundamental role. This study proposes a simulation-based model predictive control (MPC) procedure, consisting of the multi-objective optimization of operating cost for space conditioning and thermal comfort. The procedure combines EnergyPlus and MATLAB®, in which a genetic algorithm is implemented. The aim is to optimize the hourly set point temperatures with a day-ahead planning horizon, based on forecasts of weather conditions and occupancy profiles. The outcome is the Pareto front, and thus the set of non-dominated solutions, among which the user can choose according to his comfort needs and economic constraints. The critical issue of huge computational time, typical of simulation-based MPC, is overcome by adopting a reliable minimum run period. The procedure can be integrated in building automation systems for achieving a real-time optimized MPC. The methodology is applied to a multi-zone residential building located in the Italian city of Naples, considering a typical day of the heating season. Compared to a standard control strategy, the proposed MPC generates a reduction of operating cost up to 56%, as well as an improvement of thermal comfort.

AB  - Rank aggregation mechanisms have been used in solving problems from various domains such as bioinformatics, natural language processing, information retrieval, etc. Metasearch is one such application where a user gives a query to the metasearch engine, and the metasearch engine forwards the query to multiple individual search engines. Results or rankings returned by these individual search engines are combined using rank aggregation algorithms to produce the final result to be displayed to the user. We identify few aspects that should be kept in mind for designing any rank aggregation algorithm for metasearch. For example, generally equal importance is given to the input rankings while performing the aggregation. However, depending on the indexed set of web pages, features considered for ranking, ranking functions used etc. by the individual search engines, the individual rankings may be of different qualities. So, the aggregation algorithm should give more weight to the better rankings while giving less weight to others. Also, since the aggregation is performed when the user is waiting for response, the operations performed in the algorithm need to be light weight. Moreover, getting supervised data for rank aggregation problem is often difficult. In this paper, we present an unsupervised rank aggregation algorithm that is suitable for metasearch and addresses the aspects mentioned above. We also perform detailed experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm on four different benchmark datasets having ground truth information. Apart from the unsupervised Kendall-Tau distance measure, several supervised evaluation measures are used for performance comparison. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm over baseline methods in terms of supervised evaluation metrics. Through these experiments we also show that Kendall-Tau distance metric may not be suitable for evaluating rank aggregation algorithms for metasearch.

AB  - Heavy metals build-up on urban road surfaces is a complex process and influenced by a diverse range of factors. Although numerous research studies have been conducted in the area of heavy metals build-up, limited research has been undertaken to rank these factors in terms of their influence on the build-up process. This results in limitations in the identification of the most critical factor/s for accurately estimating heavy metal loads and for designing effective stormwater treatment measures. The research study undertook an in-depth analysis of the factors which influence heavy metals build-up based on data generated from a number of different geographical locations around the world. Traffic volume was found to be the highest ranked factor in terms of influencing heavy metals build-up while land use was ranked the second. Proximity to arterial roads, antecedent dry days and road surface roughness has a relatively lower ranking. Furthermore, the study outcomes advances the conceptual understanding of heavy metals build-up based on the finding that with increasing traffic volume, total heavy metal build-up load increases while the variability decreases. The outcomes from this research study are expected to contribute to more accurate estimation of heavy metals build-up loads leading to more effective stormwater treatment design.

AB  - An information transition gap exists between cleaner production and sustainable consumption. A previous study shows that adequate product-level sustainability information should be available to consumers. A set of product-level sustainability attributes that capture influencing factors to facilitate sustainable consumption behavior have been proposed. However, the weight of each attribute needs to be determined when these attributes are applied to a specific industry. Therefore, this study aims to further develop a configuration model for the automobile industry by using the knowledge of Italian experts. In this study, semi-structured interviews of experts were conducted, and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to collect data for determining the weights of attributes. The data was analyzed by using an AHP software called Super Decisions. This study is the most important step in obtaining accurate weights of attributes in a specific industry from experts. The individual result of each case and their aggregate results regarding the prominence of attributes have been obtained. This configuration model integrated the social and environmental impact of a product for the first time and aims to provide this information to consumers. Furthermore, in the context of a specific industry, the weight of each attribute was provided to further develop an information transition tool to facilitate sustainable consumption. The proposed model is expected to contribute to the studies of developing an information transition approach to promote sustainable consumption and production.

AB  - In our previous works, the diesel particulate filter (DPF) using a new composite regeneration mode by coupling microwave and ceria-manganese base catalysts is verified as an effective way to reduce the particulate matter emission of the diesel engine. In order to improve the overall performance of this DPF, its multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) model is established based on objective functions such as pressure drop, regeneration performance, microwave energy consumption, and thermal shock resistance. Then, the DPF is optimized by using MDO method based on adaptive mutative scale chaos optimization algorithm. The optimization results show that with the help of MDO, DPF’s pressure drop is decreased by 14.5%, regeneration efficiency is increased by 17.3%, microwave energy consumption is decreased by 17.6%, and thermal deformation is decreased by 25.3%. The optimization results are also verified by experiments, and the experimental results indicate that the optimized DPF has larger filtration efficiency, better emission performance and regeneration performance, smaller pressure drop, lower wall temperature and temperature gradient, and lower microwave energy consumption.

AB  - Collaboration planning among city logistics operators is important to achieve operational efficiency under municipal freight regulations such as access, sizing and timing restrictions etc. In this paper, we present a fuzzy BOCR–GRA approach for collaboration partner selection for city logistics planning under the presence of municipal freight regulations. A multi-step approach is proposed. In the first step, we identify collaboration partner evaluation criteria using BOCR framework. In the second step, linguistic assessment of criteria and alternatives (collaboration partners) is performed by a decision making committee. The linguistic data is treated via fuzzy triangular numbers for analytical processing. In the third step, alternatives are ranked using Gray Relational Analysis technique (GRA) and five BOCR scoring methods. The different alternative ranks are subject to veto and the alternative(s) with highest top ranks are considered for sensitivity analysis whereby we analyze the influence of changes in criteria weights and scoring methods on their ranks. If the rankings remain unchanged, then the veto retained alternative(s) are declared as winner(s) and recommended for collaboration. A numerical application is provided. This is one of the first works to address the collaboration partner selection problem in the context of city logistics under limited or lack of quantitative data. A comprehensive set of criteria are proposed and the best solution is generated using veto role on various scores obtained from BOCR and fuzzy GRA, thereby eliminating any bias arising from method selection.

AB  - Mounting urban pressures and increasing vulnerability to disasters highlight the need for urban sustainability and ecological wisdom especially in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. In the 1960s, Ian McHarg examined land use suitability for Staten Island with attention to ecological planning by analyzing physical and cultural characteristics of land features and biophysical vulnerabilities such as tidal inundation and coastal flooding. In this paper, we examine the impact of Hurricane Sandy focusing on land use due to unsustainable planning on Staten Island. We utilize McHarg's Staten Island land use suitability study as a comparative example of a sustainable planning. We address the questions (1) whether or not McHarg's study would have prevented damage to homes and other urban structures using empirical analysis and (2) whether McHarg's recommendations were a realistic possibility. We quantify these differences using geospatial methods and statistical analysis. Our results show that (1) a significantly lower percentage of urban damage would have occurred if land use development followed McHarg's guidelines and (2) how conflicting economic and social ideals of development and zoning issues could explain why McHarg's study would have been difficult to implement. Our findings illustrate the tradeoffs between economic development with long term environmental benefits. This emphasizes the need and opportunity to work with nature and employ urban sustainability approaches and ecological wisdom to mitigate future threats.

AB  - The building stock in the world consumes approximately 40% of the energy and emits one third of the total greenhouse gases emissions (GHG). Improving the energy efficiency in buildings is vital to address the climate change and achieve energy independence (i.e. to become net-zero energy). Improving energy performance in existing buildings has been receiving significant attention recently, which entails reducing energy demand for building operations, without affecting the health and comfort of its occupants. This approach requires strategies beyond mere technical advancements. However, there is limited published literature which has comprehensively addressed these issues. The aim of this paper is to critically review existing body-of-the-knowledge on improving energy efficiency of operating both commercial and institutional buildings. Peer-reviewed journal articles published from year 2000 to 2014 in reputed journals were reviewed. This review investigated contemporary energy efficiency approaches including technical, organizational, and behavioural changes. Based on the comprehensive literature review, a strategy map was developed as a pathway for achieving better building energy performance. It was noted that even though the existing studies predominately focused on technical advancements, approaches such as building behavioural changes have been largely overlooked. Findings of this study provide an important basis for setting up a national and organization wide strategy for improving the energy efficiency of commercial and institutional buildings.

AB  - Because of the significant impact on economic development, social stability, and ecological balance, the allocation of water resources has become an issue of worldwide concern. Therefore, the efficient, equitable, and sustainable allocation of water is vital for water management authorities. With sustainability (guaranteeing the minimum ecological water needs) as the constraint, the paper aims to enhance the water management by considering equity and efficiency. A multi-objective programming model is built with the first objective being to maximize the economic benefit efficiency to allow for the development of improved water allocation strategies and with the second objective being to maximize water allocation equity (measured using the Gini coefficient). A Compromise Programming (CP) method is employed to trade off economic benefit efficiency and equity in the water allocation, which can provide relatively flexible choices and trade-offs according to the decision makers’ preferences. The presented model is applied to the Qujiang river basin in China as a case study to demonstrate its feasibility, validity, and practicality, the results from which indicate the trade-off between equity and economic benefit efficiency in the model was feasible, and the conclusions are that river basin authorities need to take measures to decrease the rate of water loss and increase the available water to enhance water allocation efficiency and equity.
