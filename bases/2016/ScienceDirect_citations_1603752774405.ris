AB  - Maintenance activities and pavement rehabilitation require the allocation of massive finances. Yet due to budget shortfalls, stakeholders and decision-makers must prioritize projects in maintenance and rehabilitation. This article addresses the prioritization of pavement maintenance alternatives by integrating the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with the VIKOR method (which stands for ‘VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje,’ meaning multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution) for the process of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) by considering various pavement network indices. The indices selected include the pavement condition index (PCI), traffic congestion, pavement width, improvement and maintenance costs, and the time required to operate. In order to determine the weights of the indices, the fuzzy AHP is used. Subsequently, the alternatives’ priorities are ranked according to the indices weighted with the VIKOR model. The choice of these two independent methods was motivated by the fact that integrating fuzzy AHP with the VIKOR model can assist decision makers with solving MCDA problems. The case study was conducted on a pavement network within the same particular region in Tehran; three main streets were chosen that have an empirically higher maintenance demand. The most significant factors were evaluated and the project with the highest priority was selected for urgent maintenance. By comparing the index values of the alternative priorities, Delavaran Blvd. was revealed to have higher priority over the other streets in terms of maintenance and rehabilitation activities.

AB  - A proactive mechanism to learn an efficient strategy for adaptive resource clusters is proposed. In contrast to reactive techniques, that rescale the cluster to fit the past load, a predictive strategy is adopted. The cluster incoming workload is forecasted and an optimization problem is defined whose solution is the optimal action according to a utility function. Genetic-based machine learning techniques are used, including multi-objective evolutionary algorithms under the distal supervised learning setup. Experimental evaluations show that the proactive system presented in this work improves either the energetic efficiency or the number of reconfigurations of previous approaches without a loss in the quality of service. Depending on the predictability of the workload, in real world cluster scenarios additional energy savings of up to approximately 40% were measured over the best previous approach, with a 2× factor increment in the number of reconfigurations.

AB  - Supplier evaluation and selection constitutes a central issue in supply chain management (SCM). However, the data on which to base the corresponding choices in real life problems are often imprecise or vague, which has led to the introduction of fuzzy approaches. Predictive intelligent-based techniques, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), have been recently applied in different research fields to model fuzzy multi-criteria decision processes where the understanding and learning of the relationships between the input and output data are the key to select suitable solutions. In this paper, a hybrid ANFIS-ANN model is proposed to assist managers in their supplier evaluation process. After aggregating the data set through the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), the most influential criteria on the suppliers’ performance are determined by ANFIS. Then, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is used to predict and rank the suppliers’ performance based on the most effective criteria. A case study is presented to illustrate the main steps of the model and show its accuracy in prediction. A battery of parametric tests and sensitivity analyses has been implemented to evaluate the overall performance of several models based on different effective criteria combinations.

AB  - One of the biggest problems for major airline is predicting flight delay. Airlines try to reduce delays to gain the loyalty of their customers. Hence, a prediction model that airliners can use to forecast possible delays is of significant importance. In this regards, artificial neural network (ANN) techniques can be beneficial for this application. One of the main challenges of using ANNs is handling nominal variables. 1-of-N encoding is widely used to deal with this problem, however, this method is known to reduce the performance of ANN's by introducing multicollinearity. In this paper, we introduce a new type of multilevel input layer ANN that can handle nominal variables and is interpretable in a sense that one can easily see the relationships between different input variables and output variables. As a case study, the proposed method was applied to predict the delay of incoming flights at JFK airport, where the neurons of each sublayer of the input layer symbolize the delay sources at different levels of the system, and the activation of each neuron represents the possibility of being the source of overall delay. Finally, we compared the proposed approach with the traditional gradient descent back propagation ANN model and the proposed model was able to outperform the traditional backpropagation method in terms of the prediction error (root mean squared error) and time required to train the ANN model.

AB  - Root causes identification of product infant failure is nowadays one of the critical topics in product quality improvements. This paper puts forward a novel technical approach for mechanism analysis of product infant failure based on domain mapping in Axiomatic Design and the quality and reliability data from product lifecycle in the form of relational tree. The proposed method could intelligently decompose the early fault symptoms into root causes of critical functional parameters in function domain, design parameters in physical domain and process parameters in process domain successively. More specifically, both qualitative and quantitative attributes of quality and reliability types are considered for solving the root causes weight computation problem of product infant failure, this approach emphasizes the integrated application of artificial intelligence techniques of Rough Set and fuzzy TOPSIS to compute the weight of root causes. In order to enumerate the latent root causes of product infant failure, connotation of product infant failure based on the product reliability evolution model in the life cycle and data integration model of quality and reliability in production based on the extended QR chain are presented firstly. Then, a decomposition method for relational tree of product infant failure is studied based on domains of functional, physical and process in Axiomatic Design. The failure relation weight computation of root causes (nodes of relational tree) is considered as multi-criteria decision making problem (MCDM) by integrated application of Rough Set and fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), which the Rough Set is used to mining the quality data and fuzzy TOPSIS is adopted to model the computation process of failure relation weight. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is verified by a case study of analyzing a car infant failure about body noise vibration harshness complaint, and the result proves that the proposed approach is conducive to improve the intelligent level of root causes identification for complex product infant failure.

AB  - In today's competitive market, many companies are morphing from the traditional new build, single brand, and silo environments to facilities accommodating diverse business missions. The later are called heterogeneous production environments in which the different business channels share their final production stage (shipping) to enable competitive advantages. In these production environments, at the operational level, the critical success factors are customer satisfaction, on-time delivery, product complexities, supply allocation, and resource utilization. At the strategic level, the success factors are revenue, customer urgency, and sales impact. This study proposes an End-to-End Customer Order Management System (E2E COMS) focusing on effective utilization of individual and shared resources to support real-time order management and mitigate risk of managing diverse missions. The proposed system consists of three integrated tools: Order Prioritization Tool (OPT) to assess and prioritize customer orders for each business channel, Order Fulfillment Progress Projection Tool (OFPPT) to predict the expected remaining order completion time considering inventory and resource capacity constraints, and risk mitigation tool to assess the risk of missing an order shipment due to shipping constraints. A real-time dashboard is developed to visualize the prioritized customer orders, expected time to arrive at the shipping area, shipping instructions, and two-dimensional risk assessment charts. The proposed system can effectively be used for shipping capacity management as well as prompt decision making.

AB  - Designing mostly involves complex problem-solving and the need to consider many different options. Design support tools facilitate the process of obtaining optimum solutions such as the most appropriate choice of material for the component of a product. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods are useful when multi-criteria need to be considered simultaneously. MCDM can be further categorized as multi-objective decision-making, usually appropriate for design problems, and multi-attribute decision-making that typically fits better to materials selection problems. The strategic combination of materials science and computational modeling and analysis plays a key role in evaluating the performance metrics necessary to support materials selection and design.

AB  - Surrogate model-based multi-objective design optimization was performed to reduce concussion risk during frontal football helmet impacts. In particular, a topological decomposition of the football helmet facemask was performed to formulate the design problem, and brain injury metrics were exploited as objective functions. A validated finite element model of a helmeted human head was used to recreate facemask impacts. Due to the prohibitive computational expense of the full scale simulations, a surrogate modeling approach was employed. An optimal surrogate model selection framework, called Concurrent Surrogate Model Selection, or COSMOS, was utilized to identify the surrogate models best suited to approximate each objective function. The resulting surrogate models were implemented in the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) optimization algorithm. Constraints were implemented to control the solid material fraction in the facemask design space, and binary variables were used to control the placement of the facemask bars. The optimized facemask designs reduced the maximum tensile pressure in the brain by 7.5% and the maximum shear strain by a remarkable 39.5%. This research represents a first-of-its-kind approach to multi-objective design optimization on a football helmet, and demonstrates the possibilities that are achievable in improving human safety by using such a simulation-based design optimization.

AB  - The skyline query has been extensively explored as one of popular techniques to filter uninteresting data objects, which plays an important role in many real-life applications such as multi-criteria decision making and personalized services. This query has also been incorporated into commercial database systems for supporting preference queries. However, a skyline query may retrieve too many objects to analyze intensively especially for high-dimensional datasets. As a result, k-dominant skyline query has been introduced to control the number of the objects retrieved. Existing algorithms for k-dominant skyline queries only aim at complete data, which is not well-suited for incomplete data, even though incomplete data is pervasive in scientific research and real life, due to delivery failure, no power of battery, accidental loss, etc. In this paper, we systematically study the problem of k-dominant skyline queries on incomplete data (IkDS), where the data objects might miss their attribute values. We formalize the IkDS query and then present three efficient algorithms for finding k-dominant skyline objects over incomplete data. Several novel concepts/techniques are utilized including local skyline, dominance ability, and bitmap index on incomplete data to shrink the search space. In addition, we extend our techniques to tackle two interesting variants, i.e., weighted dominant skyline query and top-δ dominant skyline query, over incomplete data. Extensive experiments using both real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms.

AB  - Terrain conditions, stand structure attributes, and environmental factors are important elements that determine the success of timber harvests. Planning designs for timber harvesting projects must also be physically feasible, environmentally acceptable, and economically viable and address potentially competing objectives upfront in a multi-purpose planning effort. Under mountainous conditions involving highly variable and steep terrain, harvest planning is a particularly complex decision-making process. Here, quantitative (objective) information (e.g., stand volume) is jointly considered with qualitative (subjective) information (e.g., expert judgment of slope failure event and preference value of a certain stand) to arrive at a compromise plan that considers conflicting management objectives. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the existing terrain conditions of a large management area to find zones in which harvest operations can be conducted, assess which portions of the terrain can be harvested by different equipment that is available in the region, and locate landing sites for ground-based skidding operations. The criteria used in this study included quantitative and qualitative elements that were measured/evaluated across different scales. To address this complex decision-making process, we used an integrative approach that combined spatial analyses with multiple-criteria decision analysis (SMCDA). Existing geospatial data were combined with information obtained through pairwise evaluations of environmental, topographic, and stand structure elements to create maps in which the terrain was divided into zones of different suitability classes for timber harvests, placement of landing sites, and deployment of different harvesting systems. The results and assessment of this case study indicate that the methodology has great potential for a more integrated policy, in particular, where multiple spatial objectives explicitly need to be taken into consideration when solving complex forest-management problems in mountainous conditions. One key finding from this work that needs to be further explored involves efficient ways of incorporating this methodology into traditional harvest scheduling models to better support the operational and tactical phases of the timber harvesting.

AB  - This paper presents an approach for accessibility categorization in areas where there is no extensive data available to run the conventional analysis. The presented method has the advantages of the lower data requirements and the utility of the results. Three benchmarks were selected to evaluate transit accessibility. The first one (transit coverage) investigates the spread of the service, and it is used to assess the percentage of people in a district that can access the service within a comfortable access distance. The second (transit supply) is an effectiveness measure of the magnitude of available infrastructures such as stops, or stations over the population or land area of the underlying region. The third (route diversity) represents the variety of routes to and from different areas via transit services. Various indicators were used to assess these benchmarks. Within the context of multi-criteria decision-making, TOPSIS (Technique of Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) allows the direct comparison of measures of different units, and it is used to evaluate the relative scores of the various districts' benchmark. A K-clustering method was used to numerically categorize the areas into five groups, reflecting on the criteria levels. A case study of Abu Dhabi city is used to demonstrate the details of the procedures. The detailed analyses were used to depict districts and corridors with particular deficiencies and as such suggesting remedy strategies. The method can help transit authorities identifying the most suitable types of facilities, infrastructure, or routes that a district may need to improve its accessibility.

A range of vehicle movement data can now be automatically collected from low cost sensors that are able to assist in improving understanding distribution systems and increasing their efficiency. Vehicle monitoring technologies that have the potential to charge both passenger and goods vehicles for using the road system, allow a new array of pricing schemes to be introduced. However, E-commerce (B2C) is creating a surge in home deliveries that is increasing the social and environmental costs of goods distribution systems. This paper describes some applications of big data systems and decision support systems that can be used to enhance the design and evaluation city logistics schemes. The need to develop improved tools for understanding logistics sprawl and reducing its effects are described. Developments in alternative fuel vehicles and advanced manufacturing systems are also presented.

AB  - Energy planning for sustainable development plays an important role in guiding the future of local, regional and national energy systems. This paper presents a multi-objective energy planning methodology for regional distributed energy site selection based on natural gas (NG) CCHP systems in a high-tech industrial park in China. The energy planning developed in this paper includes four hierarchies: the planning objective; pretreatment, including load calculation and available resource estimation; site selection and configuration; and implementation. The treatment procedures in each hierarchy are described. Particularly for site selection and the configuration of CCHP schemes, multi-objective optimization is used to configure the capacities of the CCHP systems, and the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method is employed to evaluate their integrated performance, including energy generation, and impact on the environment, economy and society. The analysis results indicate that this methodology is at supporting the decision maker with regards to energy planning and site selection.

AB  - The decision of where to locate a dry port requires the analysis of the whole logistics supply chain, with the objective of transferring the largest volume of goods possible from road to more energy efficient means of transport, like rail or Short Sea Shipping, that are less harmful to the environment. However, such decision ought to cope also with the sustainability of the site inland. The objective of this article is to investigate the variables influencing sustainability of dry port location and how this sustainability can be evaluated. We propose a methodology based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). MCDA is used as a way to establish a scoring, whilst BNs were chosen to eliminate arbitrariness in setting the weightings using a technique that allows us to prioritize each variable according to the relationships established in the set of variables. In order to determine the relationships between all the variables involved in the decision, giving us the importance of each factor and variable, we built a K2 BN algorithm. To obtain the scores of each variable, we used a complete cartography analysed by ArcGIS. As case studies, the sustainability of all of the 10 existing dry ports in Spain has been evaluated. In this set of logistics platforms, we found that the most important variables for achieving sustainability are those related to environmental protection, so the sustainability of the locations requires a great respect for the natural environment and the urban environment in which they are framed.

AB  - Fuzzy models and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) systems are two well-known areas of soft-computing that have significantly helped researchers with decision-making under uncertainties. Uncertainty, an ever-present factor in construction projects, has made such intelligent systems very attractive to the construction industry. Estimating the productivity of construction operations, as a basic element of project planning and control, has become a remarkable target for forecasting models. A glimpse into this interdisciplinary field of research exposes the need for a system, that (1) models the effect of qualitative and quantitative variables on construction productivity with an improved accuracy of estimation and (2) has the ability to deal with both crisp and fuzzy input variables in one single framework. Neural-Network-Driven Fuzzy Reasoning (NNDFR), as one of the hybrid intelligent structures, displays a great potential for modeling datasets among which clear clusters are recognizable. The weakness of NNDFR in auto-tuning the design of fuzzy membership functions along with this model's insufficient attention to the optimization of number of clusters has created an area for further research. In this paper, the parameters (fuzzifier and number of clusters) of the proposed system are optimized by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) to fine-tune the system for the highest possible level of accuracy that can be exploited for productivity estimation. The proposed model is also capable of dealing with a combination of crisp and fuzzy input variables by using a hybrid modeling approach based on the application of the alpha-cut technique. The developed model helps researchers and practitioners use historical data to forecast the productivity of construction operations with a level of accuracy greater than what could be offered by traditional techniques.

AB  - Owing to environmental and waste disposal issues, enforced legislation and corporate social concern; companies are focusing on reverse logistics (RL) practices, especially in the present scenario dominated by intense competition, demanding customer and fast changing technologies. These practices are widely adopted by industries through reverse logistics partners. However, the evaluation and selection of the reverse logistics partner is a matter of concern which needs a very grave decision, involving complexity due to presence of numerous associated factors. In addition, it is hypothesized that the decision makers might be inconsistent to some extent in their views and preferences that affect other dominant constituents. Consequently, incomplete and inadequate sort of information may occur among various selection criteria, which is termed ‘multi-criteria decision making’ (MCDM) problem. The goal of the present study is to discuss an integrated model based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) for evaluation and prioritization of selection criteria and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) for the selection and development of reverse logistics partner. This study is an attempt to present a genuine concern of Indian electronics industry using an integrated approach to demonstrate the application of the proposed framework as well. In this study two stage sensitivity analyses are performed to get further insight of evaluation and selection of RL partner and verification of robustness of the model. This study aims to provide a significant contribution to electronics organizations in evaluation and selection of third party RL partner while achieving efficiency and effectiveness in RL practices.

This approach is able to consider simultaneously different factors affecting the firms’ solvency level. The results obtained in terms of classification into homogeneous rating classes, scoring and migration probabilities show that the proposed approach is able to unveil early signal of recession in the Italian SMEs sector. Furthermore, some comparisons between our approach and a couple of known methodologies for creditworthiness assessment show the goodness of our method.

AB  - Landslide susceptibility assessment of Uttarakhand area of India has been done by applying five machine learning methods namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA), Bayesian Network (BN), and Naïve Bayes (NB). Performance of these methods has been evaluated using the ROC curve and statistical index based methods. Analysis and comparison of the results show that all five landslide models performed well for landslide susceptibility assessment (AUC = 0.910–0.950). However, it has been observed that the SVM model (AUC = 0.950) has the best performance in comparison to other landslide models, followed by the LR model (AUC = 0.922), the FLDA model (AUC = 0.921), the BN model (AUC = 0.915), and the NB model (AUC = 0.910), respectively.

In conditions of rapid external changes the requirement to quality of control of purposeful development of complex system (states, regions, corporations etc.) dramatically increases. Automation support of the key stages of decision making process is one of the ways to cope with the challenges. This paper focuses on the approach based on the Big Data Refining during cognitive modeling that proves the correctness of modeling and decision-making. The approach uses the requests to the Big Data for cognitive model components verification. The requests are created by intelligent agents with feedback from decision makers. Some practical results confirm the adequacy of the proposed approach.

AB  - The exigency of energy demand from the overgrowth in the population density worldwide has prompted many countries to seek alternative renewable sources of energy. Countries with coastal regions have the advantage of the ability to utilize an extra source of renewable energy, that is, the energy from ocean waves. However, one of the major problems with wave energy is that it is location dependent, where many factors that increase its utilization potential are dependent on the feasibility of the locations. There is a lack of objective, relative and cognitive methods for the estimation of location suitability for ocean wave energy production. The present study attempts to address this lacuna and proposes a new method which is both objective and cognitive to identify suitable locations where the optimal amount of wave energy can be produced. The proposed method used the MCDM cascaded to ANN techniques to predict an index that directly represents the suitability of locations for wave energy generation. The index was applied to two different locations with varied levels of wave energy potential. The results encourage the authors for further application of the method.

Of all the current methods available, the most popular way of screening materials is via the use of materials selection charts (the so-called “Ashby” method). The charts allow a direct comparison to be easily made between different material properties, or a limited combination of material properties, via the use of performance indices. Multi-criteria decision-making techniques can also be applied when a large number of materials’ selection criteria need to be considered simultaneously.

A total of 20 assessment criteria are obtained under the five dimensions of political–economic environment, operating environment, cost environment, infrastructure facilities environment, and preferential incentive environment. The AHP results show that, from the perspective of all respondents, the top five assessment criteria are transport and distribution costs, convenience of customs clearance procedures, harbor and stevedoring costs, cost of land, and soundness of investment system and incentive measures. Based on GRA outcomes, Busan has the highest level of satisfaction as a global logistics hub port, followed by Tokyo and Kaohsiung.

KW  - Attribute reduction
AB  - Dominance-based rough set approach has attracted much attention in practical applications ever since its inception. This theory has greatly promoted the research of multi-criteria decision making problems involving preferential information. This paper mainly deals with approaches to attribute reduction in incomplete ordered information systems in which some attribute values may be lost or absent. By introducing a new kind of dominance relation, named the characteristic-based dominance relation, to incomplete ordered information systems, we expand the potential applications of dominance-based rough set approach. To eliminate information that is not essential, attribute reduction in the sense of reducing attributes is needed. An approach on the basis of the discernibility matrix and the discernibility function to computing all (relative) reducts is investigated in incomplete ordered information systems (consistent incomplete ordered decision tables). To reduce the computational burden, a heuristic algorithm with polynomial time complexity for finding a unique (relative) reduct is designed by using the inner and outer significance measures of each criterion candidate. Moreover, some numerical experiments are employed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of freshwater sediments by means of three chemometric techniques for multi-criteria analysis and decision: self-organizing network (SON), self-organizing map (SOM) and PROMETHEE&GAIA (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation with Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Aid). Selected chemometric techniques were applied to the results of Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Hg and As content in thirty Danube and fourteen Sava river sediment samples from Serbia. The potential toxicity of sediments was estimated using Probable Effect Concentrations quotients (mean PEC-Q). According to the SON analysis the Danube sediment samples were divided into three classes, Class I (mean PEC-Q range 0.27–0.51), Class II (mean PEC-Q range 0.50–0.70), and Class III (mean PEC-Q range 0.77–0.97), while the Sava samples were divided into two classes, Class II (two samples, mean PEC-Q values 0.65 and 0.69) and Class III (mean PEC-Q range 0.69–1.00). Using the SOM cluster analysis, both Danube and Sava sediment samples were classified into five subclusters, on the basis of the metal concentration level and further ranked into three levels (for remediation, moderately polluted and not polluted) by the use of multi-criteria ranking PROMETHEE method. Graphical presentation of the results obtained by PROMETHEE method using GAIA descriptive tool has provided an insight into the distribution of examined elements in sediments and has shown a significant correlation between some elements. On the basis of the results obtained, it has been concluded that the proposed chemometric approach could provide useful information in the sediment quality assessment.

AB  - This study demonstrates the application of the Dominance principle to a particular case of web (World Wide Web) content search under Multi-criteria approach: searching for “Rio de Janeiro” (City and/or State, in Brazil) followed by other attributes (or criteria). It is known that depending on the content of research that is carried out through a “seeker” (“search engine”) on the Internet, the result may fall short of the desirable, in terms of quantity and quality of the sites returned. The Dominance principle, subsequent to treatment of the collected information (unstructured data) on the Internet, aimed at revealing patterns (or logical rules) on a set of information and showed how a web content search can become more effective at a significant universe of information. Other techniques and tools have been applied to mining content on the Web, and as shown in this study. The choice of the Dominance principle associated to Rough Set Theory as Multi-criteria decision technique is due to the possibility of inaccurate data (inconsistent) and the need for treatment of these inaccuracies when processing an information system (data table) under a mathematical perspective, and do not need a history of these data. The use of Rough Set Theory and the Dominance principle associated with the probabilistic relationship between conditions and decisions in decision algorithms, is showed by the possibility of there being uncertain data to yield an essential set of effectively consistent information.

AB  - Perfect information is seldom available to man or machines due to uncertainties inherent in real world problems. Uncertainties in geographic information systems (GIS) stem from either vague/ambiguous or imprecise/inaccurate/incomplete information and it is necessary for GIS to develop tools and techniques to manage these uncertainties. There is a widespread agreement in the GIS community that although GIS has the potential to support a wide range of spatial data analysis problems, this potential is often hindered by the lack of consistency and uniformity. Uncertainties come in many shapes and forms, and processing uncertain spatial data requires a practical taxonomy to aid decision makers in choosing the most suitable data modeling and analysis method. In this paper, we: (1) review important developments in handling uncertainties when working with spatial data and GIS applications; (2) propose a taxonomy of models for dealing with uncertainties in GIS; and (3) identify current challenges and future research directions in spatial data analysis and GIS for managing uncertainties.

For this purpose, a pencil-lead bismuth film electrode was used as a working electrode. In order to optimize the parameters of square wave voltammetry a Box–Behnken design combined with desirability function was used. Different algorithms such Asymmetric Least Squares (AsLS) and Correlation Optimized Warping (COW) were employed in order to preprocess the raw data. Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Artificial Neuron Networks (ANN) were used to predict the concentration of the four metals in the samples. The method was tested successfully on raw propolis samples obtained from different localities of the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina and the results were validated with recovery assays.

AB  - Many multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods have been proposed for decision-making environments. However, the performance of these methods is degraded by the uncertainty and inaccuracy which characterizes most practical decision-making environments as a result of the inherent prejudices and preferences of the decision-makers or experts and an insufficient volume of multiple inputs and outputs (MIO) information. Accordingly, the present study proposes an enhanced MIO classification method to address these limitations of existing MCDM methods. The proposed MIO classification method designated as the FVM-index method integrates fuzzy set theory (FST), variable precision rough set (VPRS) theory, and a modified cluster validity index (MCVI) function, and is designed specifically to filter out the uncertainty and inaccuracy inherent in the surveyed MIO real-valued dataset; thereby improving the classification performance. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is first demonstrated by comparing the MIO classification results obtained for three relating UCI datasets: (1) the original dataset; (2) a dataset with a large amount of inaccurate instances; and (3) an FVM-index filtered dataset extracted from the original dataset using a statistical approach. Then, the validity of the proposed approach is illustrated by using an Augmented Reality product design and a hospital related datasets. The results confirm that the proposed FVM-index method provides a good classification performance even in the presence of inaccuracy and uncertainty. As a result, it provides a robust approach for the extraction of reliable decision-making rules.

AB  - Despite all the acknowledged advantages in terms of environmental impact reduction, energy efficiency and noise reduction, the electric mobility market is below expectations. In fact, electric vehicles have limitations that pose several important challenges for achieving a sustainable mobility system: among them, the availability of an adequate charging infrastructure is recognized as a fundamental requirement and appropriate approaches to optimize public and private investments in this field are to be delineated. In this paper we consider actual data on conventional private vehicle usage in the urban area of Rome to carry out a strategy for the optimal allocation of charging infrastructures into portions (subareas) of the urban area, based on an analysis of a driver sample under the assumption of a complete switch to an equivalent fleet of electric vehicles. Moreover, the energy requirement for each one of the subareas is estimated in terms of the electric energy used by the equivalent fleet of electric vehicles to reach their destination. The model can be easily generalized to other problems regarding facility allocation based on user demand.

AB  - Design concept evaluation is a critical stage in the product development which has significant impact on the downstream process in product development thus on success of new product. Design concept evaluation is widely recognized as a complex multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem involving various decision criteria and large amount of data which are usually imprecise and subjective. This paper proposes a new decision-making method to evaluate product design concepts based on the distance between interval vectors each alternative and positive and negative ideal reference vectors. Rank of design concepts is obtained by calculating interval-based relative closeness index for each alternative. In this method, to deal with uncertainty and vagueness of data in the primary phases of product design, performance of design concepts with respect to quantitative and qualitative criteria are concurrently evaluated using rough set and fuzzy set. The weights of criteria used in the evaluation are obtained using the extent analysis method on fuzzy AHP. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated with a numerical example and the results are compared to TOPSIS method. In final, the conclusions of our method are represented and some future directions are proposed to improve the model.

AB  - Decision support tools for building renovation are important as assistance to professional building owners when setting goals for sustainability, and for making sure that the objectives are met throughout the design process, both when renovating a single building or choosing renovation actions within a building portfolio. Existing literature on decision support tools applicable in the pre-design and design phase of renovation projects have been reviewed, with the aim of providing a state-of-the-art overview. The paper categorizes the tools into six areas in which they can support the decision makers in the renovation process: in setting sustainability goals, weighting criteria, building diagnosis, generation of design alternatives, estimation of performance, and in the evaluation of design alternatives. These six areas are unfolded throughout the paper, along with examples and discussion of the applicability of the tools in the corresponding areas of the renovation process. The study presents perspectives on the future development of decision support tools in renovation projects, including the aspect of renovating multiple buildings. Areas for future research are suggested, such as emphasizing the aspect of choosing and weighting sustainability criteria, providing explicit guidelines for screening the existing building(s), and prioritizing renovation actions within a building portfolio.

AB  - Dempster–Shafer Theory (DST) or Evidence Theory is regarded as one of the leading theories for modeling uncertainty in imprecise situations. The main advantage of this theory arises from the possibility of combining different bodies of evidence originally developed by using Dempster's combination rule. However, this rule leads to counter-intuitive results when the bodies of evidence conflict with each other to a high degree. Thus, different combinations of conflict management rules have been developed over the years where, regardless of the method used, what should be identified first of all is the level of conflict between the bodies of evidence. Therefore, different metrics were used to classify or quantify the conflict but no single one of these was successful because it is impracticable to represent all situations of conflict in this theory by using only one metric. Therefore, the contribution of this article is to analyze conflict within DST by using a multi-criteria analysis, for which the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method considered was ELECTRE TRI. On modeling the problem, three classes of conflict (low, medium and high), were considered. To validate the model, a numerical analysis was conducted that included the use of a method to point up conflict so as to infer parameters.

AB  - In this study, a new multi-criteria classification technique for nominal and ordinal groups is developed by expanding the UTilites Additives DIScriminantes (UTADIS) method with a polynomial of degree T which is used as the utility function rather than using a piecewise linear function as an approximation of the utility function of each attribute. We called this method as PUTADIS. The objective is calculating the coefficients of the polynomial and the threshold limit of classes and weight of attributes such that it minimizes the number of misclassification error. Estimation of unknown parameters of the problem is calculated by using a hybrid algorithm which is a combination of particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The results obtained by implementing the model on different datasets and comparing its performance with other previous methods show the high efficiency of the proposed method.

AB  - Flexibility of a manufacturing system is quite important and advantageous in modern industry, which function in a competitive environment where market diversity and the need for customized product are growing. Key machinery in a manufacturing system should be reliable, flexible, intelligent, less complex, and cost effective. To achieve these goals, the design methodologies for engineering systems should be revisited and improved. In particular, continuous or on-demand design improvements have to be incorporated rapidly and effectively in order to address new design requirements or resolve potential weaknesses of the original design. Design of an engineering system, which is typically a multi-domain system, can become complicated due to its complex structure and possible dynamic coupling between domains. An integrated and concurrent approach should be considered in the design process, in particular in the conceptual and detailed design phases. In the context of multi-domain design, attention has been given recently to such subjects as multi-criteria decision making, multi-domain modeling, evolutionary computing, and genetic programing. More recently, machine condition monitoring has been considered for integration into a scheme of design evolution even though many challenges exist for this to become a reality such as lack of systematic approaches and the existence of technical barriers in massive condition data acquisition, transmission, storage and mining. Recently, the internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing (CC) are being developed quickly and they offer new opportunities for evolutionary design for such tasks as data acquisition, storage and processing. In this paper, a framework for the closed-loop design evolution of engineering systems is proposed in order to achieve continuous design improvement for an engineering system through the use of a machine condition monitoring system assisted by IoT and CC. New design requirements or the detection of design weaknesses of an existing engineering system can be addressed through the proposed framework. A design knowledge base that is constructed by integrating design expertise from domain experts, on-line process information from condition monitoring and other design information from various sources is proposed to realize and supervise the design process so as to achieve increased efficiency, design speed, and effectiveness. The framework developed in this paper is illustrated by using a case study of design evolution of an industrial manufacturing system.

AB  - Following recent developments affecting the information security threat landscape, information security has become a complex managerial issue. Using grounded theory, we present a conceptual model that reflects the most up-to-date decision-making practices regarding information security investment in organizations for several industries. The framework described in this article generalizes the current decision-making processes, while taking into consideration that organizations may differ in many respects, including: the stakeholder who administers the information security budget, the Chief Information Security Officer's (CISO) role in the organization, the organization's industry sector, the organizational structure, and so on. Our findings indicate that the information security investment decision-making process contains 14 phases and 16 concepts that affect and are affected by these phases. The study shows that the decision-making process is heavily biased by different organizational and psychological factors. The conceptual model derived can assist decision makers/stakeholders in performing, reviewing, and manipulating the decision-making process in their organizations. It can also assist vendors and consultants in understanding and prioritizing various aspects of their sales cycle.

AB  - Choosing the appropriate forecasting technique to employ is a challenging issue and requires a comprehensive analysis of empirical results. Recent research findings reveal that the performance evaluation of forecasting models depends on the accuracy measures adopted. Some methods indicate superior performance when error based metrics are used, while others perform better when precision values are adopted as accuracy measures. As scholars tend to use a smaller subset of accuracy metrics to assess the performance of forecasting models, there is a need for a concept of multiple accuracy dimensions to assure the robustness of evaluation. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to propose a decision making model that allows researchers to identify the superiority of a forecasting technique over another by considering several accuracy metrics concurrently. A multi-criteria decision analysis approach, namely the preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE), was adopted to solve this problem. Bayesian Networks, Artificial Neural Networks, SVMs, Logistic Regression, and several Rule and Tree-based forecasting approaches were included in the analysis. After introducing a detailed description of accuracy measures, the performance of the prediction models are evaluated using a chosen dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

AB  - Envisioning a sustainable biorefinery requires reliable information on the sustainable availability of biomass, optimal plant location and delivered cost. In this paper, we have developed an integrated Geographic Information System (GIS) based sustainable biomass assessment, site optimization and supply logistics cost model to assess the spatial and temporal availability of crop residues, to identify optimal plant sites and to calculate the delivered cost. The grid-level (30×30m) assessment model was developed for crop residues using three primary sustainability indicators: (1) Soil Erosion (SE), (2) Soil Conditioning Index (SCI) and (3) Crop residue yield ⩾2.5dryMg/ha. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) prediction models for each indicator were developed and implemented in the GIS platform to assess sustainably available crop residues. A multi-criteria geospatial analysis was used to identify suitable plant sites. GIS-based location-allocation model was used to site biorefineries/plants at optimal locations and generate feedstock supply curves. The developed model was demonstrated with the sustainable assessment of cotton stalk (CS) to produce fuel pellets in the study region (Georgia, USA). The model has estimated that about 1.6milliondryMg of CS is available annually to support seven pellet plants with an average annual plant capacity of 200,000dryMg. The average delivered cost of CS ranged between 68 and 75$/dryMg delivered as large rectangular bales with the transport radii ranged from 31 to 60km. The spatial and temporal variations in the topology and crop yield directly influenced the sustainable availability of CS, the optimal plant location and its capacity and the delivered cost. However, the changes in the optimal plant location and delivered cost were minimal for large capacity plants (>400,000dryMg). The developed model can be used to assess multiple crop residues, to manage and control feedstock supply risks and delivered cost variations for a sustainable biorefinery.

AB  - Solar energy is a natural, clean, and inexhaustible resource to help the earth solve its energy crisis and reduce the air pollution caused by coal, nuclear, and gas electricity plants. Solar heating, solar photovoltaics, and solar thermal electricity can contribute to solving some of the most urgent problems the world faces. Despite the anti-dumping tariff and the anti-subsidy policy negatively impacting solar companies in Taiwan and China, solar cells are facing strong recovery of market growth in 2015. However, fierce competition in terms of cost and quality has resulted in a series of corporate acquisitions or bankruptcies since 2012. Inspired by the concept of business intelligence, a balanced scorecard (BSC) based framework is proposed to address the following issues: (1) How to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that influence outcomes? (2) How to guide the lagging group to benchmark with the leading group (business diagnosis)? (3) How to adjust the significant KPIs to improve outcomes (what-if simulation)? In particular, classification and regression tree (fused with logistic regression) and back propagation neural network (fused with multiple regression) are adopted to provide managerial insights for worldwide solar companies. Furthermore, support vector machine (regression) is used to justify the validity of the presented framework.

AB  - Strategic planning is a vital management tool for projecting the long-range business goals and is not only for big businesses, but also applicable to small businesses in spite of their limited resources. To do this effectively, organizations should determine their strengths and weaknesses. Organizations have to produce appropriate action plans to overcome these weaknesses and it is very important to prioritize the action plans according to limited resources. In the current practice, a sequential model for overcoming this prioritization problem has not been studied in the related literature. Therefore we proposed a fuzzy sequential model (FSM) to help organizations in strategic planning process. This model includes four steps which are; determining open to improvement areas (OIAs), determining the root cause, developing action plans for each root cause and determining priority of OIAs hence action plans respectively. The proposed model was applied in a local manufacturing small medium enterprise (SME) as a real world case study. Results of the case study show that relatively more prioritized OIAs for the SME are, “mid-level managers take inadequate initiatives”, “failure to comply with the design calendar in Research & Development (R&D) and Product Development (P&D) processes”, “small lot sizes”, respectively.

AB  - The present work proposes an experimental investigation and optimization of various process parameters during taper cutting of deep cryo-treated Inconel 718 in wire electrical discharge machining process. Taguchi's design of experiment is used to gather information regarding the process with less number of experimental runs considering six input parameters such as part thickness, taper angle, pulse duration, discharge current, wire speed and wire tension. Since traditional Taguchi method fails to optimize multiple performance characteristics, maximum deviation theory is applied to convert multiple performance characteristics into an equivalent single performance characteristic. Due to the complexity and non-linearity involved in this process, good functional relationship with reasonable accuracy between performance characteristics and process parameters is difficult to obtain. To address this issue, the present study proposes artificial neural network (ANN) model to determine the relationship between input parameters and performance characteristics. Finally, the process model is optimized to obtain a best parametric combination by a new meta-heuristic approach known as bat algorithm. The results of the proposed algorithm show that the proposed method is an effective tool for simultaneous optimization of performance characteristics during taper cutting in WEDM process.

AB  - Microarray-based gene expression profiling has emerged as an efficient technique for classification, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. Frequent changes in the behavior of this disease generates an enormous volume of data. Microarray data satisfies both the veracity and velocity properties of big data, as it keeps changing with time. Therefore, the analysis of microarray datasets in a small amount of time is essential. They often contain a large amount of expression, but only a fraction of it comprises genes that are significantly expressed. The precise identification of genes of interest that are responsible for causing cancer are imperative in microarray data analysis. Most existing schemes employ a two-phase process such as feature selection/extraction followed by classification. In this paper, various statistical methods (tests) based on MapReduce are proposed for selecting relevant features. After feature selection, a MapReduce-based K-nearest neighbor (mrKNN) classifier is also employed to classify microarray data. These algorithms are successfully implemented in a Hadoop framework. A comparative analysis is done on these MapReduce-based models using microarray datasets of various dimensions. From the obtained results, it is observed that these models consume much less execution time than conventional models in processing big data.

Hospitals as integrated parts of the wide-ranging health care systems have dominant focus on health care provision to meet, maintain and promote people's health needs of a community. This study aimed to assess the service quality of teaching hospitals of Yazd University of Medical Sciences using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS).
Methods
A literature review and a qualitative method were used to obtain experts' viewpoints about the quality dimensions of hospital services to design a questionnaire. Then, using a self-made questionnaire, perceptions of 300 patients about the quality of delivered services were gathered. Finally, FAHP was applied to weigh each quality dimension and TOPSIS method to rank hospital wards.
Results
Six dimensions including responsiveness, assurance, security, tangibles, health communication and Patient orientation were identified as affecting aspects of hospital services quality among which, security and tangibles got the highest and lowest importance respectively (0.25406, 0.06883). Findings also revealed that in hospital A, orthopedics and ophthalmology wards obtained the highest score in terms of quality while cardiology department got the lowest ranking (0.954, 0.323). In hospital B, the highest and the lowest ranking was belonged to cardiology and surgical wards (0.895, 0.00) while in hospital C, surgical units were rated higher than internal wards (0.959, 0.851).
Conclusion
Findings emphasized that the security dimension got the lowest ranking among SERVQUAL facets in studied hospitals. This requires hospital executives to pay special attention to the issue of patients’ security and plan effectively for its promotion.

AB  - Water quality assessment entails essentially a multi-criteria decision-making process accounting for qualitative and quantitative uncertainties and their transformation. Considering uncertainties of randomness and fuzziness in water quality evaluation, a cloud model-based assessment approach is proposed. The cognitive cloud model, derived from information science, can realize the transformation between qualitative concept and quantitative data, based on probability and statistics and fuzzy set theory. When applying the cloud model to practical assessment, three technical issues are considered before the development of a complete cloud model-based approach: (1) bilateral boundary formula with nonlinear boundary regression for parameter estimation, (2) hybrid entropy-analytic hierarchy process technique for calculation of weights, and (3) mean of repeated simulations for determining the degree of final certainty. The cloud model-based approach is tested by evaluating the eutrophication status of 12 typical lakes and reservoirs in China and comparing with other four methods, which are Scoring Index method, Variable Fuzzy Sets method, Hybrid Fuzzy and Optimal model, and Neural Networks method. The proposed approach yields information concerning membership for each water quality status which leads to the final status. The approach is found to be representative of other alternative methods and accurate.

AB  - This paper explores the use of data-driven approximation algorithms, often called surrogate modeling, in the early-stage design of structures. The use of surrogate models to rapidly evaluate design performance can lead to a more in-depth exploration of a design space and reduce computational time of optimization algorithms. While this approach has been widely developed and used in related disciplines such as aerospace engineering, there are few examples of its application in civil engineering. This paper focuses on the general use of surrogate modeling in the design of civil structures and examines six model types that span a wide range of characteristics. Original contributions include novel metrics and visualization techniques for understanding model error and a new robustness framework that accounts for variability in model comparison. These concepts are applied to a multi-objective case study of an airport terminal design that considers both structural material volume and operational energy consumption.

AB  - Today’s largest and fastest growing companies’ assets are no longer physical, but rather digital (software, algorithms...). This is all the more true in the manufacturing, and particularly in the maintenance sector where quality of enterprise maintenance services are closely linked to the quality of maintenance data reporting procedures. If quality of the reported data is too low, it can results in wrong decision-making and loss of money. Furthermore, various maintenance experts are involved and directly concerned about the quality of enterprises’ daily maintenance data reporting (e.g., maintenance planners, plant managers...), each one having specific needs and responsibilities. To address this Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem, and since data quality is hardly considered in existing expert maintenance systems, this paper develops a maintenance reporting quality assessment (MRQA) dashboard that enables any company stakeholder to easily – and in real-time – assess/rank company branch offices in terms of maintenance reporting quality. From a theoretical standpoint, AHP is used to integrate various data quality dimensions as well as expert preferences. A use case describes how the proposed MRQA dashboard is being used by a Finnish multinational equipment manufacturer to assess and enhance reporting practices in a specific or a group of branch offices.

AB  - This paper presents the application of the combination of simulation model and multi-criteria decision models for evaluating investment in agricultural processing. The simulated alternatives are evaluated with multi-attribute decision tools expert system. The simulation system consists of deterministic production simulation models that enable different types of costs calculations for organic production and on farm food processing in the framework of supplementary activities. Simulation models were further evaluate by a qualitative multi-attribute decision modelling methodology using the software tool DEX-I and quantitative analytical hierarchical process (AHP). The simulation model was also evaluated by the standard financial analysis (i.e., cost benefit analysis). These results show that there was the difference before and after investment into specific processing equipment of three organic products with respect to positive financial values. The financial analysis reveals that after 10 years the farm had constant annual cash flow with an investment return at 9.43%. This showed that investments into organic farm was feasible financially. The integrated simulation model as the discount cash flow and multi-criteria decision analysis are the suitable methodological tool fordecision support system on organic farms. The system takes into consideration different independent criteria and enables ranking of farm business alternatives. The model is useful in minimizing risk and inappropriate decision in investment.

AB  - Reverse logistics (RL) practices are gaining attention because of environmental concern, enforced regulation and social issues; these practices are widely adopted by industries through reverse logistics partners. However, the evaluation and selection of the reverse logistics partner is a very critical decision, involving complexity due to existence of numerous related factors. Hence, it is considered as multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. In this study an attempt has been made to evaluate and select reverse logistics partner (RLP). This paper presents a combined model based on Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) for evaluation and ranking of selection criteria and Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) for the final selection of reverse logistics partner. A case of Indian Electronics Company demonstrates the application of the proposed framework. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to verify the robustness of the proposed approach. This study will benefits Indian electronics organizations in evaluation and selection of third party RL partners while achieving efficiency and effectiveness in RL practices.

AB  - Performance evaluation and selection of end-of-life products have emerged as crucial issues for firms looking to adopt a product recovery strategy to achieve environmental responsibility while still meeting profit goals within the reverse supply chain. However, there is still a lack of a comprehensive methodology to address the issues because of the variety of decision factors involved and the inherent uncertainties associated with them. This research proposes and investigates a multiphase hybrid approach to identify the recoverable products that best meet the criteria set (such as technical feasibility, economic benefit, and environmental effect). The proposed method simultaneously considers multiple and conflicting goals, practical constraints, and information uncertainty. First, fuzzy logic and probability theory are utilized to estimate the quality condition of used products and subsequently conduct the cost-benefit analysis based on the product life-cycle information. Then, the modified preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations is used as a multi-criteria decision-making tool to quantifyand aggregate the linguistic evaluation items into recovery preference factors. Further, all the qualitative and quantitative data are incorporated in a goal programming model to achieve a compromise and satisfied solution. We present a numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed approach can provide strong and flexible support for product recovery decision-making within the reverse supply chain.

AB  - While most dental clinicians use some sort of information system, they are involved with administrative functions, despite the advisory potential of some of these systems. This paper outlines some current decision support systems (DSS) and the common barriers facing dentists in adopting them within their workflow. These barriers include lack of perceived usefulness, complicated social and economic factors, and the difficulty for users to interpret the advice given by the system. A survey of current systems found that although there are systems that suggest treatment options, there is no real-time integration with other knowledge bases. Additionally, advice on drug prescription at point-of-care is absent from such systems, which is a significant omission, in consideration of the fact that disease management and drug prescription are common in the workflow of a dentist. This paper also addresses future trends in the research and development of dental clinical DSS, with specific emphasis on big data, standards and privacy issues to fulfil the vision of a robust, user-friendly and scalable personalised DSS for dentists. The findings of this study will offer strategies in design, research and development of a DSS with sufficient perceived usefulness to attract adoption and integration by dentists within their routine clinical workflow, thus resulting in better health outcomes for patients and increased productivity for the clinic.

AB  - The amount of data produced and communicated over the Internet is significantly increasing, thereby creating challenges for the organizations that would like to reap the benefits from analyzing this massive influx of big data. This is because big data can provide unique insights into, inter alia, market trends, customer buying patterns, and maintenance cycles, as well as into ways of lowering costs and enabling more targeted business decisions. Realizing the importance of big data business analytics (BDBA), we review and classify the literature on the application of BDBA on logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) – that we define as supply chain analytics (SCA), based on the nature of analytics (descriptive, predictive, prescriptive) and the focus of the LSCM (strategy and operations). To assess the extent to which SCA is applied within LSCM, we propose a maturity framework of SCA, based on four capability levels, that is, functional, process-based, collaborative, agile SCA, and sustainable SCA. We highlight the role of SCA in LSCM and denote the use of methodologies and techniques to collect, disseminate, analyze, and use big data driven information. Furthermore, we stress the need for managers to understand BDBA and SCA as strategic assets that should be integrated across business activities to enable integrated enterprise business analytics. Finally, we outline the limitations of our study and future research directions.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to compare time series forecasting by using three different backpropagation neural networks. A daily time series of Vale Company in the period March 1, 2000-June 10, 2006 is used as a reference against which results from other forecasts are compared. Three types of backpropagation neural networks are constructed with different input layers: the first among those makes use of the real time series data; the second uses the normalized real time series data; and the third uses the normalized real time series data and the Choquet integral in order to fuzzify the input layer. In all of the three backpropagation neural networks a hidden layer with tangent sigmoid transfer function and different numbers of neurons are used. In the output of the three neural networks a linear transfer function with one neuron for obtaining a linear equation after their training is used. The forecasting equations obtained for each neural networks are used with outsample data to forecast Vale's time series data and compare against real data. On the basis of the obtained results we conclude that the use of Choquet integral in this context is powerful enough so that its use must be recommended.

AB  - Academic research on E-learning has increased extensively over the past few years. Although, many multi-criteria decision making methods have been proposed to evaluate and examine the effectiveness of E-learning, there is a lack of study concerning systematic literature review and classification of research in this area. Regarding this, five major databases including ScienceDirect, Emerald, Taylor and Francis, IEEE, and Springer have been selected and a systematic methodology proposed. Consequently, a review of 42 published papers appearing in 33 academic journals and international conferences between 2001 and 2015 have been obtained to achieve a comprehensive review of MCDM application in E-learning. Accordingly, the selected papers have been classified by the year of publication, MCDM techniques, and journals and conferences in which they appeared. In addition, the significant criteria in evaluating E-learning were found. This study supports researchers and practitioners in effectively adopting MCDM techniques regarding E-learning evaluation and provides an insight into its state-of-the-art.

AB  - Users of computing systems and devices frequently make decisions related to information security, e.g., when choosing a password, deciding whether to log into an unfamiliar wireless network. Employers or other stakeholders may have a preference for certain outcomes, without being able to or having a desire to enforce a particular decision. In such situations, systems may build in design nudges to influence the decision making, e.g., by highlighting the employer’s preferred solution. In this paper we model influencing information security to identify which approaches to influencing are most effective and how they can be optimized. To do so, we extend traditional multi-criteria decision analysis models with modifiable criteria, to represent the available approaches an influencer has for influencing the choice of the decision maker. The notion of influence power is introduced to characterize the extent to which an influencer can influence decision makers. We illustrate our approach using data from a controlled experiment on techniques to influence which public wireless network users select. This allows us to calculate influence power and identify which design nudges exercise the most influence over user decisions.

AB  - In this paper, a new similarity measure and a weighted similarity measure on intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (IFSSs) are proposed and some of their basic properties are discussed. Using the proposed similarity measure, a relation (≈α) between two IFSSs are defined and it is found that the defined relation is not an equivalence relation. Further, the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure is demonstrated in a numerical example with the help of measure of performance and measure of error. Moreover, medical diagnosis problems have been exhibited through a hypothetical case study by using this proposed similarity measure. Finally, the proposed method is applied to 10 different medical data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository datasets and its similarity measures are calculated. The corresponding performance measures, like, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC curves, AUC values, and F-measures are obtained and it is compared with the existing methods. This shows that the proposed method exhibits more accuracy, sensitivity and enhanced F-measures than the existing methods.

By comparing against traditional KDDM models, we demonstrate the need and relevance of the snail shell model, particularly in addressing faster turnaround and frequent model updates that characterize knowledge discovery in the big data environment.

AB  - The correct budget allocation for road maintenance, which represents a significant infrastructure investment in urban roads, requires the accurate prediction of the deterioration of bituminous hot mix asphalt (HMA). In this study, three different deterioration models have been developed that can predict the future performance of pavements in urban HMA paved roads. First, the current condition of the pavements was measured by using the pavement condition index (PCI), which is approved by the PAVER system. Then, three different models were developed to predict deterioration in the PCI as a function of pavement age, and applied to urban road networks in Samsun (Turkey). The models used were deterministic regression analysis, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Variations of each model were explored and the one with the highest computational efficiency was employed for ranking pavement sections with respect to rehabilitation needs. Results indicated that the three approaches had comparable prediction accuracies and R-squared values, although predictions provided by the ANN model were more accurate compared with the other models. The article provides a detailed comparison of the performance of the three models.

AB  - As part of France's political intentions to reduce CO2 emissions in building and transport, this work offers an analysis from the perspective of a public authority on the various innovation policies for the deployment of electric vehicles powered by solar photovoltaic electricity (PV) by the year 2030. This innovation involves enhancing the synergy between buildings and mobility by associating positive energy houses with electric vehicles. The vehicle battery, charged primarily using PV electricity, could also provide a way of storing intermittent solar-generated electricity for later use. The aim of this article is to implement a decision-making model for public administration which can select the best innovation policies based on a number of criteria reflecting their major goals in terms of policies relating to energy, economics, social cohesion and “factor 4″ (to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a factor of 4 by 2050 compared with 1990 levels). The methodology developed herein has been applied to a concrete case, with some resulting recommendations which may be of use for the public authorities: simultaneously combine research in favour of solar mobility technologies and apply a relatively high carbon tax. Such recommendations are mitigated by the choice of the data set and the methodological shortcomings.

AB  - To which extent do potential users of construction products take sustainability into account during their decision-making process? How well could they align themselves in all the legislation frameworks and calculation tools for the sustainable construction products? In accordance with the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) [1], determining of ecological properties of construction products could be accomplished with applying life cycle assessment (LCA). There is a number of tools and frameworks for evaluating the sustainability of construction products for the European experts, which may be used in such a decision-making process. However, for a non-expert user, this could be quite complex. Therefor, the assumption here is that environmental and human health safety are prior in contrast to the market prices when it comes to choosing a decorative paint or coating. In the framework of herein research, an Analytic Hierarchy/Network Process model was designed involving four major merits of the Analytic Hierarchy Process: Benefits, Opportunities, Costs, and Risks [2]. The model which is based on the major characteristics of a decorative wall paint helps emphasising the best alternative with respect to given priorities: low risk of environmental and human health damage, quality, market price, repairability. The model shows values for all the criteria and alternatives with respect to pairwise comparisons. In a future research step, this model will be validated with a questionnaire survey targeting non-expert users, i.e. average consumers, on the construction market in Germany.

The tool is based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), namely the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), that allows users to rank possible solutions according to their requirements. In this study, we performed rankings of pairs of eight extraction and three dispersive solvents used in DLLME for chlorophenols extraction from water samples. The first ranking involved sensitivity and precision of the method for each of the nine chlorophenols. The tool is a quantitative solution to the common analytical problem that the change of analytical performance results in better performance for some analytes and worse for others. The second ranking included the assessment of the greenness of each pair of solvents, based on toxicological, ecotoxicological and environmental persistence criteria. The third ranking was based on a combination of sensitivity, precision and greenness criteria. Heptane as an extraction solvent and acetone as a dispersive solvent were selected as the most appropriate ones. The TOPSIS tool is a successful, easy to implement, incorporation of green analytical chemistry values to analytical method optimization.

AB  - Landslide susceptibility mapping is one of the crucial stages of landslide hazard and risk assessment. Moreover, the susceptibility maps assist planners, local administrations, and decision makers in disaster planning. Various approaches have been applied in the literature to increase the accuracy of landslide susceptibility maps. The determination of suitable susceptibility mapping method plays critical role for obtaining required accuracy. In this study, the performances of three quantitative susceptibility mapping methods are evaluated. The logistic regression (LR) analysis is the typical example of statistical methods, while GIS-based multi-criteria decision analyses (MCDA) and association rule mining (ARM) are the examples of heuristic and data mining methods, respectively. The susceptibility maps based on the three methods are obtained for Şavşat in Artvin province (NE Turkey) where the region has intense landslides. The landslide influencing parameters for the study area are lithology, land use/land cover, soil type, erosion, altitude, slope, aspect, distance to drainage, soil depth, distance to fault, distance to road. The models for the three methods are then compared and evaluated by using pixel-based evaluation metrics. Results showed that ARM provides a higher quality percent (QP), whereas percent of damage detection (PDD) is higher for LR method. The lowest QP is obtained by GIS-based MCDA. It is found that LR and ARM methods are better than GIS-based MCDA in modeling the landslide susceptibility and they can be integrated to obtain better performance.

AB  - The main goal of green supply chain management (GSCM) is to reduce the negative environmental impacts in all activities and stages of a supply chain. Evaluation of suppliers in a supply chain according to environmental criteria can help us to achieve this goal of GSCM. Since this evaluation usually comprises some alternatives and some criteria, green supplier selection (GSS) could be considered as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. To handle the uncertainty of information in an MCDM problem, the theory of fuzzy sets is an effective tool. Interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs), which are characterized by an interval membership function, is very flexible to model the uncertainty of the MCDM problems. In this study, a new integrated approach based on Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method, is proposed to deal with multi-criteria group decision-making problems with IT2FSs. This approach is based on the operators of IT2FSs, some modifications in the classical WASPAS method and a new procedure for calculation of criteria weights. In the procedure of calculation of criteria weights, we combine the subjective weights expressed by decision-makers with objective weights resulted from an entropy method to obtain more realistic weights. To show the applicability of the proposed approach in the real-world MCDM problems, a green supplier selection problem is used. We perform a sensitivity analysis with different weights of criteria and different values of method's parameters to show the stability of the proposed approach. This analysis shows that combining the subjective and objective weights can help to increase the stability of the proposed approach with different weights of criteria. A comparison is also made between the results of the proposed approach and some existing methods for validating the proposed approach. This analysis shows that the proposed approach is efficient and well consistent with the other methods.

AB  - Predicting the direction and movement of stock index prices is difficult, often leading to excessive trading, transaction costs, and missed opportunities. Often traders need a systematic method to not only spot trading opportunities, but to also provide a consistent approach, thereby minimizing trading errors and costs. While mechanical trading systems exist, they are usually designed for a specific stock, stock index, or other financial asset, and are often highly dependent on preselected inputs and model parameters that are expected to continue providing trading information well after the initial training or back-tested model development period. The following research leads to a detailed trading model that provides a more effective and intelligent way for recognizing trading signals and assisting investors with trading decisions by utilizing a system that adapts both the inputs and the prediction model based on the desired output. To illustrate the adaptive approach, multiple inputs and modeling techniques are utilized, including neural networks, particle swarm optimization, and denoising. Simulations with stock indexes illustrate how traders can generate higher returns using the developed adaptive decision support system model. The benefits of adding adaptive and intelligent decision making to forecasts are also discussed.

AB  - A Bayesian belief network (BBN) was developed to assess preferred combinations of trees in live fences and on pastures in silvopastoral systems. The BBN was created with information from Rivas, Nicaragua, using local farmer knowledge on tree species, trees' costs and benefits, farmers' expressed needs and aspirations, and scientific knowledge regarding tree functional traits and their contribution to ecosystem services and benefits. The model identifies combinations of trees, which provide multiple ecosystem services from pastures, improving their productivity and contribution to farmer livelihoods. We demonstrate how the identification of portfolios of multifunctional trees can satisfy a profile of desired ecosystem services prioritized by the farmer. Diagnostics using Bayesian inference starts with an identification of farmer needs and ‘works backwards’ to identify a silvopastoral system structure. We conclude that Bayesian belief networks are a promising modeling technique for multi-criteria decisions in farm adaptation processes, where interventions must be adapted to specific contexts and farmer preferences.

AB  - In order to meet customer requirements, manufacturing companies need to cope with the challenge of constantly evolving product ranges. Breakthroughs in the analysis of big data will give us a better understanding of market trends and customer requirements, but there will always be some degree of uncertainty when foreseeing product evolution. Manufacturing system designers have to therefore take decisions under uncertainty, whilst considering other factors such as business, manufacturing and change strategies. In order to address this problem the factories need to be designed with a level of changeability that will allow them to be flexible or reconfigurable to produce future product platform evolutions. This paper thus contributes a novel fuzzy logic based approach to support manufacturing system designers in exploring changeability level decisions. Using this approach, this paper presents the system architecture used for an experimental implementation of an intelligent ICT tool for supporting the design of a changeable manufacturing system.

AB  - The wide spread of internet resources has emerged new paradigms of learning and knowledge delivery to facilitate and enhance learning particularly in e-learning systems. The important milestones of these new paradigms are known as digital learning objects (DLO) which are smallest packed bits for learning. The abundance of these DLOs raises an important question on how to select effectively high quality reusable learning objects. There exist many soft computing approaches such as; fuzzy computing, neural networks, evolutionary computing, support vector machines, machine learning and probabilistic reasoning. In this paper, fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods in choosing suitable DLOs were reviewed. This paper discusses recent variety of soft computing methods used in selecting and evaluating digital learning objects through multi criteria decision analysis approaches used; for selecting metrics like basic topical, course similarity, internal topical, basic and user similarity personal, and context similarity situational relevance and for evaluation; scalarization method, employing triangular, trapezoidal and distance based similarity (adapted from TOPSIS techniques). As DLOs continue to evolve it is inevitable to utilize multi-criteria techniques for selecting and or improving quality. The abundance of DLOs has increased the need for applying practical soft computing techniques to retrieve high quality, reusable DLOs.

AB  - In this study, we consider learning preference structure of a Decision Maker (DM). Many preference modeling problems in a variety of fields such as marketing, quality control and economics involve possibly interacting criteria, and an ordinal scale is used to express preference of objects. In these cases, typically underlying preference structure of the DM and distribution of criteria values are not known, and only a few data can be collected about the preferences of the DM. For developing a preference model under such circumstances, we propose using nonparametric Statistical Learning approaches interactively. In particular, we employ Active Learning by asking a preference question to the DM at each step and try to reach a close approximation to the correct model in a small number of steps. Our experimental analysis proves that the proposed approach outperforms a “naive” approach where subsequent questions are asked randomly. In the study, we also provide algorithmic recommendations for modeling different underlying value functions, if information is available about the form of the preference structure and/or distribution of criteria values. This study can be regarded as a pioneering approach considering that Statistical Learning based approaches in the literature have been developed and tested based on a relatively large preference information and they do not interact with the DM in model developing process while Multi Criteria Decision Aid based approaches typically ignore interactions among the criteria, suffer from generalization ability, and have no concern about predicting equally good everywhere in the criteria domain.

AB  - Abundant software tools use visual analytics (VA) techniques to support various decisions with the aim of boosting better insights. Large organizations, however, lose efficiency in selecting the right tools to support the persons who apply the tools to various decision tasks. Consequently, the creation and sharing of insights are far from optimal, leading consistently to sub-optimal decisions. In this work, the Co-Insights framework is introduced with automated collaboration support features to enable effective creation and sharing of distributed insights. A collaboration network (Co-Net) is established to model the collaborative decision making process in an organization. Two important features of the Co-Insights framework are developed: collaborative agent allocation analysis (CA3) for task–participant matching; and a robust mechanism for the recommendation of selected VA tools, by participant–tool matching. Thus, by better matching of tasks and tools with participants, the creation and sharing of insights are improved in any collaborative team for better decision making, accompanied with the tacit knowledge transfer to sustain the entire organization. To validate the effectiveness of these two main features, two experiments built on the Co-Net model are performed to test the newly developed algorithms. It has been found that CA3 significantly improves the matching scores by up to 35%, compared with conventional task–participant matching methods. The neural network based participant–tool matching mechanism yields robust results with 4% mismatches for 10% noise levels, and with 16% mismatches for 30% noise levels. Real case applications and implications are described, and further plans to extend this new framework are also outlined based on the reported experiments and evaluations.

AB  - Skyline computation, which returns a set of interesting points from a potentially huge data space, has attracted considerable interest in big data era. However, the flourish of skyline computation still faces many challenges including information security and privacy-preserving concerns. In this paper, we propose a new efficient and privacy-preserving skyline computation framework across multiple domains, called EPSC. Within EPSC framework, a skyline result from multiple service providers will be securely computed to provide better services for the client. Meanwhile, minimum privacy disclosure will be elicited from one service provider to another during skyline computation. Specifically, to leverage the service provider’s privacy disclosure and achieve almost real-time skyline processing and transmission, we introduce an efficient secure vector comparison protocol (ESVC) to construct EPSC, which is exclusively based on two novel techniques: fast secure permutation protocol (FSPP) and fast secure integer comparison protocol (FSIC). Both protocols allow multiple service providers to calculate skyline result interactively in a privacy-preserving way. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed EPSC framework can achieve multi-domain skyline computation without leaking sensitive information to each other. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations also demonstrate the EPSC’s efficiency in terms of providing skyline computation and transmission while minimizing the privacy disclosure across different domains.

In this research, this technique is applied first in a two-stage approach to assess the relative efficiency of Malaysian Islamic banks using the most frequent indicators found in the banking literature. Besides, in the second stage, neural networks are combined with TOPSIS results as part of an attempt to produce a model for banking performance with effective predictive ability. The results reveal that variables related to cost structure have a prominent negative impact on efficiency levels, although some parsimony in equity leveraging derived from Islamic finance principles maybe helpful in achieving higher efficiency levels. Findings also indicate that the Malaysian Islamic banking market also imposes cultural and regulatory barriers to foreign banks, so that their efficiency levels are lower when compared to their national counterparts. Learning curves (trend impact) are relevant in predicting efficiency levels.

Significantly, the present strategy was compared and contrasted with that of a traditional sustainable community development (SCD) strategy. In response to a large earthquake in Nepal, engineering students at Metropolitan State University of Denver (MSU Denver) examined technological interventions for the emergency needs of affected communities in the disaster's immediate aftermath. Using community information acquired through interviews and secondary data, they developed a simple biosand filter that is inexpensive, easy to build and made from materials that are available, accessible and affordable to beneficiaries. Students chose a design, built it, tested it and wrote instruction manuals in both Nepali and pictogram formats. These manuals were then distributed through NGO partners doing relief work in Nepal. Finally, this study explores how the use of an AT assessment tool–originally designed for decision support in the project design phase–might instead be used for monitoring and evaluation of AT effectiveness in an emergency response scenario.

AB  - In this paper a new hybrid approach obtained combining a multi-objective particle swarm optimization and artificial neural network is proposed for the design optimization of a direct-drive permanent magnet flux switching generators for low power wind applications. The targets of the proposed multi-objective optimization are to reduce the costs and weight of the machine while maximizing the amplitude of the induced voltage as well as minimizing its total harmonic distortion. The permanent magnet width, the stator and rotor tooth width, the rotor teeth number and stator pole number of the machine define the search space for the optimization problem. Four supervised artificial neural networks are designed for modeling the complex relationships among the weight, the cost, the amplitude and the total harmonic distortion of the output voltage respect to the quantities of the search space. Finite element analysis is adopted to generate training dataset for the artificial neural networks. Finite element analysis based model is verified by experimental results with a 1.5kW permanent magnet flux switching generator prototype suitable for renewable energy applications, having 6/19 stator poles/rotor teeth. Finally the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid procedure is compared with the results given by conventional multi-objective optimization algorithms. The obtained results show the soundness of the proposed multi objective optimization technique and its feasibility to be adopted as suitable methodology for optimal design of permanent magnet flux switching generator for wind application.

AB  - In social networks, identifying influential nodes is essential to control the social networks. Identifying influential nodes has been among one of the most intensively studies of analyzing the structure of networks. There are a multitude of evaluation indicators of node importance in social networks, such as degree, betweenness and cumulative nomination and so on. But most of the indicators only reveal one characteristic of the node. In fact, in social networks, node importance is not affected by a single factor, but is affected by a number of factors. Therefore, the paper puts forward a relatively comprehensive and effective method of evaluation node importance in social networks by using the multi-objective decision method. Firstly, we select several different representative indicators given a certain weight. We regard each node as a solution and different indicators of each node as the solution properties. Then through calculating the closeness degree of each node to the ideal solution, we obtain evaluation indicator of node importance in social networks. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method experimentally on a few actual social networks.

AB  - The development of freight villages in a given region is often viewed as a popular project in the development of a particular country's logistic plans. However, the evaluation of a freight village location among the various alternatives is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem including both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Obtaining relevant geographic data is another problem for the evaluation of freight village locations. In this study, a geographic information system (GIS)-based MCDM model is proposed to evaluate potential locations for freight villages. The proposed model consists of four sequential phases. In the first phase, different geographic criteria are determined from existing literature, and data are gathered using GIS. By criteria weights equally, alternative locations are determined through GIS in the second phase. In the third phase, identified criteria are weighted using analytical network process (ANP) method by various stakeholders of potential freight villages. In the fourth phase, the “Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)” method is applied in order to determine the best alternative based on the weighted criteria. Using real data from the city of Ankara, Turkey, we test the applicability of our evaluation approach and compare the best alternative obtained by the proposed method with the current freight village (CFV) location in Ankara.

AB  - Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a valuable resource within operations research and management science. Various MCDA methods have been developed over the years and applied to decision problems in many different areas. The outranking approach, and in particular the family of ELECTRE methods, continues to be a popular research field within MCDA, despite its more than 40 years of existence. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review of English scholarly papers on ELECTRE and ELECTRE-based methods is performed. Our aim is to investigate how ELECTRE and ELECTRE-based methods have been considered in various areas. This includes area of applications, modifications to the methods, comparisons with other methods, and general studies of the ELECTRE methods. Although a significant amount of literature on ELECTRE is in a language different from English, we focus only on English articles, because many researchers may not be able to perform a study in some of the other languages. Each paper is categorized according to its main focus with respect to ELECTRE, i.e. if it considers an application, performs a review, considers ELECTRE with respect to the problem of selecting an MCDA method or considers some methodological aspects of ELECTRE. A total of 686 papers are included in the review. The group of papers considering an application of ELECTRE consists of 544 papers, and these are further categorized into 13 application areas and a number of sub-areas. In addition, all papers are classified according to the country of author affiliation, journal of publication, and year of publication. For the group of applied papers, the distribution by ELECTRE version vs. application area and ELECTRE version vs. year of publication are provided. We believe that this paper can be a valuable source of information for researchers and practitioners in the field of MCDA and ELECTRE in particular.

AB  - Vast majority of practical engineering design problems require simultaneous handling of several criteria. For the sake of simplicity and through a priori preference articulation one can turn many design tasks into single-objective problems that can be handled using conventional numerical optimization routines. However, in some situations, acquiring comprehensive knowledge about the system at hand, in particular, about possible trade-offs between conflicting objectives may be necessary. This calls for multi-objective optimization that aims at identifying a set of alternative, Pareto-optimal designs. The most popular solution approaches include population-based metaheuristics. Unfortunately, such methods are not practical for problems involving expensive computational models. This is particularly the case for microwave and antenna engineering where design reliability requires utilization of CPU-intensive electromagnetic (EM) analysis. In this work, we discuss methodologies for expedited multi-objective design optimization of expensive EM simulation models. The solution approaches that we present here rely on surrogate-based optimization (SBO) paradigm, where the design speedup is obtained by shifting the optimization burden into a cheap replacement model (the surrogate). The latter is utilized for generating the initial approximation of the Pareto front representation as well as further front refinement (to elevate it to the high-fidelity EM simulation model level). We demonstrate several application case studies, including a wideband matching transformer, a dielectric resonator antenna and an ultra-wideband monopole antenna. Dimensionality of the design spaces in the considered examples vary from six to fifteen, and the design optimization cost is about one hundred of high-fidelity EM simulations of the respective structure, which is extremely low given the problem complexity.

AB  - Detection of size, shape and color of minerals are important for obtaining information about minerals. The output of mines is ores which vary in colors and shapes. The multiplicity of ores, large scale features and the importance of speeding up the mineral type detection process for intelligent systems, leads us to rely more on expert's advice and rank the selected available features for type detection, according to their importance. In this paper, to separate different ores and gangue minerals, image processing and computer vision techniques with combination of multi criteria decision making (MCDM) approach are applied. Our method proposes a novel way which combines the image processing techniques and artificial neural networks, with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approaches to detect different types of ores. By help of experts in feature ranking, the image processing techniques proved to be more effective and prompt. The final results show that the proposed method is more successful in type detection of minerals than the other image processing techniques for ores type detection. Our method is also applicable for real-time systems to estimate minerals at on-line ore sorting and classification stages.

AB  - The Hospital Information System (HIS) is a computer system aimed at providing a paperless environment that covers all aspects of the hospital's operation such as clinical, administrative, and financial systems. The aim of this study is to provide more insight within the context of Malaysia to understand the potential factors that importantly driving or inhibiting the decision of HIS adoption from non-adopters' perspective. This study mainly integrates the diffusion of innovation theory, technology-organization-environment framework, institutional theory along with human-organization-technology fit model that can be tailored in understanding of the HIS adoption by Malaysian public hospitals. In this regard, the initial model is designed by considering four main dimensions (Technology, Environment, Human, Organization) with seventeen variables based on reviewing of the existing extensive literature of information system in particular information technology adoption in line with prior HIS adoption studies. Accordingly, a Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (ANP), one of the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques, model is developed to determine the most important factors among the four categories for the HIS adoption in the context of Malaysian public hospitals. These factors are identified and compared by 20 hospital experts and decision makers, who are fully familiar of HIS technology with also professional management and decision-making experience in hospitals. Then fuzzy ANP is applied to compute the weights of incorporated factors in the HIS adoption. The results reveal that hospitals with compatibility, complexity, mimetic pressure and vendor support are more likely to adopt HIS. Hence, the decision to adopt HIS is mainly determined by technological and environmental context. The study and its findings have resulted in theoretical contributions and research implications where the integrated theoretical model serves as a tool for healthcare industry to gain insight into the process of HIS adoption.

AB  - Small and medium sized enterprises have a wide influence in many economic sectors. They provide a substantial part of the jobs and goods while at the same time emitting huge amounts of pollutants. Existing research could prove that there is a lot of emission reduction potential available, but at the same time show that most enterprises do not implement cleaner production measures. One major obstacle is the absence of tools that provide easy to understand decision support for sustainability decisions in conjunction with corporate environmental management information systems, which also fit the requirements of small and medium sized enterprises. This article presents a multi-criteria decision support system and its integration into a corporate environmental management information system to overcome this barrier. The decision support approach is based on reference points, which makes it relatively easy to understand. Reference points may be adjusted by the decision maker in form of saturation levels to match his/her preferences more closely. To increase user acceptance the final results will be investigated with sensitivity analyses and an explanation system. This will enable decision makers in small and medium sized enterprises who have only a limited amount of time and are not familiar with the concept of multi-criteria decision making to implement the concept of cleaner production and examine whether the use of renewable resources or a cascade utilization of materials is beneficial.

AB  - Decision-making for sustainable design requires the evaluation of different options considering all sustainability dimensions simultaneously: economic, environmental and social. Each dimension has a specific relative importance, which depends on the process that is being assessed. The determination of the relative importance is not a simple task, principally, during early design stages when detailed information about the process is scarce, and when core decisions affecting the entire design are made. An example of this kind of decisions during early design stages is the selection of the chemical process route, which, once defined, provides the guidelines for the process design. The present study proposes a multi-criteria analysis based methodology to evaluate different chemical process route options under sustainability criteria and to guide the selection among them. The methodology uses normalized indicators to assess each sustainability dimension, and a multi-criteria analysis method (MCDA) to calculate the weights and influences between dimensions. Indicators, dimension weights and influences are integrated into the Sustainable Cumulative Index (SCI) that can be used to compare chemical process route options in sustainability terms and to support their selection. The proposed methodology is illustrated through the assessment and selection of a chemical process route to produce ethyl acetate.

AB  - With the explosion of data generation, getting optimal solutions to data driven problems is increasingly becoming a challenge, if not impossible. It is increasingly being recognised that applications of intelligent bio-inspired algorithms are necessary for addressing highly complex problems to provide working solutions in time, especially with dynamic problem definitions, fluctuations in constraints, incomplete or imperfect information and limited computation capacity. More and more such intelligent algorithms are thus being explored for solving different complex problems. While some studies are exploring the application of these algorithms in a novel context, other studies are incrementally improving the algorithm itself. However, the fast growth in the domain makes researchers unaware of the progresses across different approaches and hence awareness across algorithms is increasingly reducing, due to which the literature on bio-inspired computing is skewed towards few algorithms only (like neural networks, genetic algorithms, particle swarm and ant colony optimization). To address this concern, we identify the popularly used algorithms within the domain of bio-inspired algorithms and discuss their principles, developments and scope of application. Specifically, we have discussed the neural networks, genetic algorithm, particle swarm, ant colony optimization, artificial bee colony, bacterial foraging, cuckoo search, firefly, leaping frog, bat algorithm, flower pollination and artificial plant optimization algorithm. Further objectives which could be addressed by these twelve algorithms have also be identified and discussed. This review would pave the path for future studies to choose algorithms based on fitment. We have also identified other bio-inspired algorithms, where there are a lot of scope in theory development and applications, due to the absence of significant literature.

AB  - To compare the accuracy of different forecasting approaches an error measure is required. Many error measures have been proposed in the literature, however in practice there are some situations where different measures yield different decisions on forecasting approach selection and there is no agreement on which approach should be used. Generally forecasting measures represent ratios or percentages providing an overall image of how well fitted the forecasting technique is to the observations. This paper proposes a multiplicative Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model in order to rank several forecasting techniques. We demonstrate the proposed model by applying it to the set of yearly time series of the M3 competition. The usefulness of the proposed approach has been tested using the M3-competition where five error measures have been applied in and aggregated to a single DEA score.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop a hybrid methodology that integrates machine learning algorithms with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques to effectively conduct multi-attribute inventory analysis. In the proposed methodology, first, ABC analyses using three different MCDM methods (i.e. simple-additive weighting, analytical hierarchy process, and VIKOR) are employed to determine the appropriate class for each of the inventory items. Following this, naïve Bayes, Bayesian network, artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are implemented to predict classes of initially determined stock items. Finally, the detailed prediction performance metrics of algorithms for each method are determined. The comprehensive case study executed at a large-scale automotive company revealed that the best classification accuracy is achieved by SVMs. The results also revealed that Bayesian networks, SVMs and ANNs are all capable of successfully dealing with the unbalanced data problems associated with Pareto distribution, and each of these algorithms performed well against all examined measures, thus validating the fact that machine learning algorithms are highly applicable to inventory classification problems. Therefore, this study presents uniqueness in that it is the first and foremost of its kind to effectively combine MCDM methods with machine learning algorithms in multi-attribute inventory classification and is practically applicable in various inventory settings. Furthermore, this study also provides a comprehensive chronological overview of the existing literature of machine learning methods within inventory classification problems.

AB  - Virtual Enterprise (VE) is a temporary platform for individual enterprises to collaborate with each other, sharing their core competencies to fulfill a customer demand. In order to improve the customer satisfaction, the most successful VEs select their consortium's members based on customer's preferences. There is quite extensive literature in the field of partner selection in VE, each proposing a new approach to evaluate and select the most appropriate partners among pool of enterprises. However, none of the studies in literature recommend which partner selection methodology should be used in each project with a particular customer attitude. In this study an algorithm is proposed which classifies the customers into three categories; passive, standard and assertive. Three different approaches; Fuzzy Logic- FAHP TOPSIS and Goal programming are used for each customer type respectively. This classification is beneficial since the problem's characteristics; such as vagueness of data, change as the customer's attitude varies. The results certify that, adopting this algorithm not only helps the VE to select the most appropriate partners based on customer preferences, but also the model adapts itself to each customer's attitude. As a result, the overall system flexibility is significantly improved.

AB  - The sustainability of the built environment largely depends on its energy and environmental performances. The overall objective, across the different phases of the building life cycle, is to improve building and system performances in terms of economics, comfort, environmental impact and durability. Several modelling methodologies have been developed in order to evaluate the energy performance of buildings. Generally, every modelling methodology responds effectively to some specific tasks, but there exists a lack of integration in particular with respect to the cross-disciplinary role of data. Given the multi-scale and multi-objective nature of the problem of optimization of the energy and environmental performances of the built environment, an appropriate synthesis and integration process in modelling methodologies has to be identified, addressing realistically the uncertainties inherently present in modelling strategies. Visualization and data analysis techniques are successfully used in a wide variety of applications, both in theoretical and applied domains, but questions remains about their robustness, efficiency and applicability to the problems introduced before. The paper aims to analyze critically these topics by means of case studies, showing a possible path to create a multi-scale methodology able to synthesize all the relevant aspects.

AB  - Human-driven alterations to freshwater ecosystems are leading to a global decline of river function and biodiversity. In our experience, managers want to be given many possible options to restore freshwater ecosystems that are workable within spatial, temporal, operational, and budgetary constraints of the system. Correspondingly, a new field for systematic river restoration planning has emerged through the use of well-established systems design concepts like multi-objective optimization and tradeoff analysis. In this article, we propose a decision framework for systematic river restoration planning where economic-environment systems design and tradeoff analyses are employed as a concurrent planning procedure before restoration interventions are implemented. Heuristic optimization and multi-criteria decision analysis methods are proposed to systematically design and objectively evaluate non-dominated economic-environment tradeoffs associated with restoration strategies within a watershed, and to provide a short-list of viable restoration alternatives to decision makers for negotiation and implementation. The proposed framework has the capacity to make science-based information and sophisticated decision support methods available for stakeholder deliberation. To illustrate the phases of the framework, we use a published case study of systematic restoration planning in South East Queensland, Australia.

AB  - Although artificial neural networks have recently gained importance in time series applications, some methodological shortcomings still continue to exist. One of these shortcomings is the selection of the final neural network model to be used to evaluate its performance in test set among many neural networks. The general way to overcome this problem is to divide data sets into training, validation, and test sets and also to select a neural network model that provides the smallest error value in the validation set. However, it is likely that the selected neural network model would be overfitting the validation data. This paper proposes a new model selection strategy (IHTS) for forecasting with neural networks. The proposed selection strategy first determines the numbers of input and hidden units, and then, selects a neural network model from various trials caused by different initial weights by considering validation and training performances of each neural network model. It is observed that the proposed selection strategy improves the performance of the neural networks statistically as compared with the classic model selection method in the simulated and real data sets. Also, it exhibits some robustness against the size of the validation data.

AB  - The popularity of business intelligence (BI) systems to support business analytics has tremendously increased in the last decade. The determination of data items that should be stored in the BI system is vital to ensure the success of an organisation's business analytic strategy. Expanding conventional BI systems often leads to high costs of internally generating, cleansing and maintaining new data items whilst the additional data storage costs are in many cases of minor concern – what is a conceptual difference to big data systems. Thus, potential additional insights resulting from a new data item in the BI system need to be balanced with the often high costs of data creation. While the literature acknowledges this decision problem, no model-based approach to inform this decision has hitherto been proposed. The present research describes a prescriptive framework to prioritise data items for business analytics and applies it to human resources. To achieve this goal, the proposed framework captures core business activities in a comprehensive process map and assesses their relative importance and possible data support with multi-criteria decision analysis.

AB  - A novel and generic multi-objective design paradigm is proposed which utilizes quantum-behaved PSO (QPSO) for deciding the optimal configuration of the LQR controller for a given problem considering a set of competing objectives. There are three main contributions introduced in this paper as follows. (1) The standard QPSO algorithm is reinforced with an informed initialization scheme based on the simulated annealing algorithm and Gaussian neighborhood selection mechanism. (2) It is also augmented with a local search strategy which integrates the advantages of memetic algorithm into conventional QPSO. (3) An aggregated dynamic weighting criterion is introduced that dynamically combines the soft and hard constraints with control objectives to provide the designer with a set of Pareto optimal solutions and lets her to decide the target solution based on practical preferences. The proposed method is compared against a gradient-based method, seven meta-heuristics, and the trial-and-error method on two control benchmarks using sensitivity analysis and full factorial parameter selection and the results are validated using one-tailed T-test. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method outperforms opponent methods in terms of controller effort, measures associated with transient response and criteria related to steady-state.

However, as a Cloud service environment encompasses many uncertainties that may hinder users to make sound decisions, it is highly desirable to handle fuzzy information when choosing a suitable service in an uncertain environment. In this paper, we present a novel fuzzy decision-making framework that improves the existing Cloud service selection techniques. In particular, we build a fuzzy ontology to model uncertain relationships between objects in databases for service matching, and present a novel analytic hierarchy process approach to calculate the semantic similarity between concepts. We also present a multi-criteria decision-making technique to rank Cloud services. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy ontology-based similarity matching. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed method.

AB  - In stressful situations such as severe accidents in nuclear power plants, operators need support tools to ease decision making in the selection of accident management measures. Following the Three Mile Island (TMI) accident in 1979, the first severe accident in a nuclear power plant, Accident Management Support Tools (AMSTs) were extensively developed and installed in a number of nuclear power plants. Lessons learned from the Fukushima accident highlighted the importance of accident management in mitigation severe accidents and suggested the reconsideration of accident management programs, which in turn created the need for AMSTs adaption and modernization. This paper provides the first post-Fukushima comprehensive review of AMSTs, covering the particularities of all their elements, unlike other previous review papers which are limited to the study of individual fields, such as fault detection or decision-making support. Applications, advantages, and disadvantages of various methods which can be used in the design of AMSTs are investigated, categorized and compared in general well-known categories (Artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, etc.). Moreover, human factor related issues in implementation of AMSTs are introduced and discussed. It was concluded that a modern AMST can provide vital information about the plant states, e.g. timing of critical events and a quantitative estimation of important parameters, which cannot be provided by typical Severe Accident Management Guidelines (SAMG). Nonetheless, it is emphasized that AMSTs should only have a supporting role in accident management, not replace SAMG.

AB  - Multi criteria decision making (MCDM) is one of the research areas of operations research and management science which has widely studied by researchers and practitioners. It finds a compromise solution for evaluating and ranking alternatives from the best to the worst under conflicting criteria with respect to decision maker(s) preferences. In a compromise approach, the VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR; that means multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution) continues to be applied satisfactorily across different application areas. This paper conducts a state-of-the-art literature review to categorize, analyze and interpret the current research on VIKOR applications. It also discusses the extensions of VIKOR applied in fuzzy environments. A total of 343 papers are classified into 13 different application areas and a number of sub-application areas. Furthermore, all papers are also categorized with respect to publication year, published journal, country of origin, application type (real case study vs empirical study), and version of fuzzy sets used.

AB  - Creativity workshops (i.e. brainstorming, creativity contests and design jams) are increasingly being used by organisations to explore new design spaces and find original ideas for new products or services. The selection of ideas resulting from these creative processes is a key activity for a firm, as it serves as a foundation for time management and decisions on further investments. Moreover, the selection of promising ideas has a more significant impact than the creative process itself as it colours the overall innovation process. We argue that this type of decision is strongly context dependent. That is, the selection process is conditioned by several factors such as the firm's technological and organisational capabilities and its strategy. This implies that a relevant idea for a particular company is not necessarily relevant for another. This paper proposes a context formalisation approach, supported by multi-criteria decision-making analysis tools to evaluate ideas resulting from a creative workshop. This evaluation process seeks to assist the decision-making by requiring success criteria to take into account the firm's context and priorities and give decision-makers the keys to establish a coherent evaluation. Implementation of this approach during a creative workshop validates the appeal of this type of contextualised evaluation. It contributes to the field of practical application of ideas in productive environments. The proposed methodology is illustrated through a case study on the new eco-tourism services for the city of Leticia in the Amazonian region of Colombia with a view to sustainable development.

KW  - Multi-criteria decision analysis
AB  - In recent years, exchanging data has become far easier with the rapidly growing popularity and increased mobility of mobile devices. However, data exchange between mobile devices is performed as a peer-to-peer communication. Each mobile device that serves as a candidate has a whole range of hardware statuses which may influence data exchange performance. Thus, the selection of a mobile device with sufficient computing resources to facilitate round-robin data exchange is an interesting process worth exploring. This study proposes an optimal mobile device selection approach for round-robin data exchange via the monitoring of the hardware status of each candidate device's system profile. A case study demonstrates the proposed approach, step by step. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can be used to improve round-robin data exchange performance. The contribution of this study is to provide an approach which selects an optimal candidate mobile device for round-robin data exchange in a local wireless communication network.

AB  - With the rapid proliferation of online information, how to find useful information, such as suitable jobs, appropriate experts, and proper projects, is really an important problem. Recommendation technique, as one of emerging tools to deal with information overload and information asymmetry, is critically important for providing personalized online information services. With the increase of R&D investment in government and industry, such as high-tech companies and advanced manufacturing enterprises, more and more R&D project information are launched in public websites for cooperation. When the number of online information and users is extremely huge, how to effectively recommend R&D project opportunities to related researchers and practitioners is a challenging and complex task. In this paper, a novel two-stage method is proposed for R&D project opportunity recommendation. An information filtering method is first offered to identity proper R&D projects as a candidate set. Then, an information aggregation model with various constraints is suggested to recommend appropriate R&D projects for applicants. The proposed method has been implemented in an online research community – ScholarMate (www.scholarmate.com). An online user study has been conducted and the evaluation results exhibit that the proposed method is more effective than existing ones.

AB  - This work deals with the engine performance and emissions of a single cylinder spark-ignition (SI) engine fueled by hydrogen. Advanced simulations of the combustion process were performed using a commercial software package. The extended Zeldovich mechanism with coefficients for carbon-free fuel was utilized to investigate the most accurate formation rate of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions within the engine. The first part of this work focuses on simulating the engine performance and emissions at different equivalence ratios. Different techniques that have significant effects on engine performance and emissions such as exhaust gas recirculation and ignition timing, were also were studied. A thorough explanation of the relationship between the performance, emissions, and the operating parameters considered is presented. The second part of this work focuses on optimization of the operating parameters. The best operating conditions for hydrogen engines were obtained by solving the multi-objective problem of maximizing engine power and efficiency while minimizing the NOx.

AB  - Geothermal energy is a form of renewable energy which, unlike other sources of this kind, is always available and can be used continuously without interruption. Furthermore, the environmental pollution caused by its exploitation is far less than that created by conventional fossil fuels. Meanwhile, hydrogen has an extensive application in production of petroleum and petrochemical products and is therefore an important element of Iran's oil and gas reliant industry and economy. This paper studied the potential of different provinces of Iran for producing hydrogen by a water electrolyzer using the electricity generated from a geothermal source. This objective was pursued by using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method to rank and prioritize the provinces, which were modeled as decision-making units. Validity of the results obtained through this analysis was assessed by comparing them with results of the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR). VIKOR appeared in the year 1990 from Serbian language: Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje that means: Multicriteria Optimization and Compromise Solution. In this DEA model, the decision criteria were 13 measurable parameters, of which 5 were considered as input variables and 8 as output variables, and as mentioned above its decision-making units were the 14 Iranian provinces. The results showed that East-Azerbaijan, Bushehr and Hormozgan have the highest priority and Kerman and Sistan-Baluchistan have the lowest priority for hydrogen production via geothermal power assisted water electrolysis.
