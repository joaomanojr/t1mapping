AB  - The concentrations of 15 elements were measured in the leaf samples of Aesculus hippocastanum, Tilia spp., Betula pendula and Acer platanoides collected in May and September of 2014 from four different locations in Belgrade, Serbia. The objective was to assess the chemical characterization of leaf surface and in-wax fractions, as well as the leaf tissue element content, by analyzing untreated, washed with water and washed with chloroform leaf samples, respectively. The combined approach of self-organizing networks (SON) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) aided by Geometrical Analysis for Interactive Aid (GAIA) was used in the interpretation of multiple element loads on/in the tree leaves. The morphological characteristics of the leaf surfaces and the elemental composition of particulate matter (PM) deposited on tree leaves were studied by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector. The results showed that the amounts of retained and accumulated element concentrations depend on several parameters, such as chemical properties of the element and morphological properties of the leaves. Among the studied species, Tilia spp. was found to be the most effective in the accumulation of elements in leaf tissue (70% of the total element concentration), while A. hippocastanum had the lowest accumulation (54%). After water and chloroform washing, the highest percentages of removal were observed for Al, V, Cr, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Sb (>40%). The PROMETHEE/SON ranking/classifying results were in accordance with the results obtained from the GAIA clustering techniques. The combination of the techniques enabled extraction of additional information from datasets. Therefore, the use of both the ranking and clustering methods could be a useful tool to be applied in biomonitoring studies of trace elements.

AB  - Users of computing systems and devices frequently make decisions related to information security, e.g., when choosing a password, deciding whether to log into an unfamiliar wireless network. Employers or other stakeholders may have a preference for certain outcomes, without being able to or having a desire to enforce a particular decision. In such situations, systems may build in design nudges to influence the decision making, e.g., by highlighting the employer’s preferred solution. In this paper we model influencing information security to identify which approaches to influencing are most effective and how they can be optimized. To do so, we extend traditional multi-criteria decision analysis models with modifiable criteria, to represent the available approaches an influencer has for influencing the choice of the decision maker. The notion of influence power is introduced to characterize the extent to which an influencer can influence decision makers. We illustrate our approach using data from a controlled experiment on techniques to influence which public wireless network users select. This allows us to calculate influence power and identify which design nudges exercise the most influence over user decisions.

AB  - Demand forecasting is one of the important inputs for a successful restaurant yield and revenue management system. Sales forecasting is crucial for an independent restaurant and for restaurant chains as well. In this chapter a comprehensive literature review and classification of restaurant sales and consumer demand techniques are presented. Sales prediction is very complex due to the impact of internal and external environment. However, a reliable sales forecasting methodology can improve the quality of business strategy. A range of methodologies and models for forecasting are given in the literature. These techniques are categorized here into seven categories, also including hybrid models. The methodology for different kinds of analytical methods is briefly described, the advantages and drawbacks are discussed, and relevant set of papers is selected. Conclusions and comments are also made on future research directions.

AB  - Biomass based energy production has been considered as a part of the solution to energy crisis, which is mainly caused by diminishing fossil fuel resources and environmental pollution from traditional fossil fuel based energy production systems. Therefore, it is important to design sustainable and effective systems for biomass based energy production to provide competitive advantage on fossil fuel resourced systems. This study develops a novel optimization model to aid investment planning and strategic management of biomass based clean power generation systems. The model integrates the location, capacity and technology decisions to find the optimal combination of bioenergy production systems to meet electricity demand of particular regions and accounts for multiple biomass types and power technologies. The modelling approach and data analysis are presented to outline the important characteristics of the problem for minimization of the supply chain cost and minimization of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions simultaneously. To handle the multi objective problem efficiently, an integrated approach based on fuzzy decision making and ε-constraint method is proposed and used, considering both sustainability aspects and uncertainties in the system parameters. The viability of the proposed approach is explored on a case study of İzmir region in Turkey. Different supply chain configuration alternatives are provided for the case study region considering various weights for objective functions representing relative importance of each objective. Corresponding supply chain performance measures in terms of total cost and GHG emissions are proposed and discussed for each configuration alternative. Further enviro-economic analyses denote that discounted investment cost and GHG emissions associated with energy production activities receive the biggest shares in the total cost and in the total GHG emissions, respectively. The government and private investors can employ the model and solution algorithm to design the most cost effective and environment friendly supply chain, to monitor the economic and environmental performance of the current biomass based supply chains and identify policies to support a viable, profitable and eco-friendly energy industry.

AB  - Energy efficiency has been a primary subject of concern in the building sector, which consumes the largest portion of the world's total energy. Especially for existing buildings, retrofitting has been regarded as the most feasible and cost-effective method to improve energy efficiency. When planning retrofit in public buildings, the most obvious objectives are to: (1) minimize energy consumption; (2) minimize CO2 emissions; (3) minimize retrofit costs; and (4) maximize thermal comfort; and one must consider these concerns together. The aim of this study is to apply evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm (NSGA-III) that can handle four objectives at a time to the application of building retrofit planning. A brief description of the algorithm is given, and the algorithm is examined using a building retrofit project, as a case study. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using three measures: average distance to true Pareto-optimal front, hypervolume, and spacing. The results show that this study could be used to find a comprehensive set of trade-off scenarios for all possible retrofits, thereby providing references for building retrofit planners. These decision makers can then select the optimal retrofit strategy to satisfy stakeholders’ preferences.

AB  - The multiple new challenges facing agriculture require the development of innovative cropping systems with high environmental, economic and social performances. Many research programmes are currently focusing on the design of such cropping systems. Some include the multicriteria assessment of cropping systems by diverse methods and approaches. Some of these research programmes are supported by experimental or farmers’ networks, generating new opportunities for data analysis and raising new research and methodological questions. In this article, we provide an overview based on a review of 56 articles, comparing the various methods for sustainability assessment in single- and multi-site studies. Articles were classified according to three characteristics: (i) their objectives, (ii) the study design (single- vs. multi-site), (iii) the type of system assessed (fictitious vs. real). Our analysis was structured around four items: (i) the variables used to describe cropping systems and production situations and the use of these variables in the assessment process, (ii) the criteria and associated indicators assessed, (iii) the methods used to explore multiple aspects of the performance of cropping systems, (iv) the use of reference values. We identified key points to be taken into account in multi-site studies. The application of the proposed guidelines to experimental networks should facilitate the identification of high-performance cropping systems and the identification of the drivers of cropping system performance.

AB  - A wide number of real problems requiring qualitative answers should be addressed by one-class classification (OCC), as in the case of authentication studies, verification of particular claims and quality control. The key feature of OCC is that models are developed using only samples from the target class, so that a representative sampling is not strictly required for non-target classes. On the contrary, in the discriminant analysis (DA) approach, all of the classes considered (at least two) have a non-negligible influence in the definition of the delimiter. It follows that faults in the definition of the classes involved and in representative sampling for each of them may determine a bias in the classification rules. A key aspect in one-class classification concerns model optimisation. When the optimal modelling conditions are searched by considering parameters such as type II error or specificity (‘compliant’ approach), information from the non-target class is being used and may therefore determine a bias in the model. In order to build pure class models (‘rigorous’ approach), only information from the target class should be regarded: in other words, optimisation should be performed only considering type I error, or sensitivity. In the present study, ‘compliant’ and ‘rigorous’ approaches are critically compared on real case studies, by applying two novel modelling techniques: partial least squares density modelling (PLS-DM) and data driven soft independent modelling of class analogy (DD-SIMCA).

AB  - Increasing urbanization, in terms of growth in population as well as geographical spread, in the developing countries has significant implications for the transport sector. First is the increase in traffic volume and second, energy consumption. With constraints on energy resource availability, threat to climate change and transport infrastructure inadequacies, the above two implications need immediate attention of the planners and policy makers. However, there is inadequate research in understanding effect of urban system on energy dimension. The present work aims to understand this effect. For this study, urban system is considered as a close boundary system with residential and mobility as major contributors towards transport energy consumption. A set of Indian cities are considered for the study and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a non-parametric technique is applied to study residential and mobility subsystem efficiency against energy subsystem.

AB  - The determination of petrol filling station location in Surabaya has not considered the stakeholders’ preference on environmental safety perspective and also the sub surface condition yet. As a vital facility, this condition may lead to disastrous condition. Thus, the objective of this paper is to recommend petrol filling station location which is safe for environment and living community in surrounding. As the extend of previous work which is focus on stakeholders’ preference, this current work emphasized on subsurface condition which may influence the stability of petrol filling station infrastructure. However, the result of previous study still will be presented to keep the good coherence of the discussion. Three stages have been set up to reach the objective of this study. Firstly, assess the stakeholder's preference for petrol filling location criteria using AHP method. Secondly, assess and mapping the seismic microzonation using fuzzy clustering method. Thirdly, suitability analysis based on stakeholder's preference and seismic microzonation to find recommended location using GIS method. As the result of the study shows that based on stakeholder's preference, the proper selection of land use criteria appears as the most important criteria for determining petrol filling station location and yielded 31,2% influence. Based on seismic microzonation, the North part of Surabaya mainland from East to West which is near to Madura Straight is high susceptible for local seismic. As a conclusion based on the overlay mapping of these two findings, the Central part of Surabaya heading to West is the most suitable location for petrol filling station. The result of this study could be used as an evaluation for existing petrol filling station location or either for future preference. In another hand, it could be a very useful recommendation for zoning regulation to control the development of petrol filling station which doesn’t concern environmental safety.

With the rapid development of breeding equipments, large scale breeding becomes possible, massive data evaluation has to be done by software automatically. In this circumstance, this paper tries to evaluate variety with the collected informative data through data mining technologies. According to the characteristics, plant breeding evaluation is considered as an ordinal classification task, and a rank entropy-based decision tree algorithm is proposed to do this classification. The algorithm uses historical trait phenotype and evaluation data to construct decision trees, which are then used to generate evaluations for future cultivars with their trait phenotype. To demonstrate the effectiveness, experiments are carried out on three groups of soybean variety comparison tests (early-maturity, medium-maturity, and green soybean). This work can free breeders from a large number of basic work while increase the efficiency of plant breeding.

KW  - Water quality monitoring programs

KW  - Participative approaches
AB  - The reliable assessment of water quality through water quality monitoring programs (WQMPs) is crucial in order for decision-makers to understand, interpret and use this information in support of their management activities aiming at protecting the resource. The challenge of water quality monitoring has been widely addressed in the literature since the 1940s. However, there is still no generally accepted, holistic and practical strategy to support all phases of WQMPs. The purpose of this paper is to report on the use cases a watershed manager has to address to plan or optimize a WQMP from the challenge of identifying monitoring objectives; selecting sampling sites and water quality parameters; identifying sampling frequencies; considering logistics and resources to the implementation of actions based on information acquired through the WQMP. An inventory and critique of the information, approaches and tools placed at the disposal of watershed managers was proposed to evaluate how the existing information could be integrated in a holistic, user-friendly and evolvable solution. Given the differences in regulatory requirements, water quality standards, geographical and geological differences, land-use variations, and other site specificities, a one-in-all solution is not possible. However, we advance that an intelligent decision support system (IDSS) based on expert knowledge that integrates existing approaches and past research can guide a watershed manager through the process according to his/her site-specific requirements. It is also necessary to tap into local knowledge and to identify the knowledge needs of all the stakeholders through participative approaches based on geographical information systems and adaptive survey-based questionnaires. We believe that future research should focus on developing such participative approaches and further investigate the benefits of IDSS's that can be updated quickly and make it possible for a watershed manager to obtain a timely, holistic view and support for every aspect of planning and optimizing a WQMP.

AB  - Background
There has been tremendous progress regarding treatment options for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Several interferon-free regimens are awaiting regulatory approval. These innovations promise substantial reductions in the burden of disease and side effects as well as a decrease in treatment duration.
Objectives
The aim of this quantitaitive study was to elicit patient preferences for attributes of innovative antiviral therapies for hepatitis C.
Methods
A systematic literature search and 14 semi-structured interviews were performed, resulting in eight patient-relevant characteristics. For the discrete choice experiment, an experimental design (3×3 + 5×6) was generated using Ngene software. The survey was conducted in August 2014 through computer-assisted personal interviews. The data were effects-coded in a random parameter logit estimation.
Results
Participants were patients with HCV (N = 561; 58.1% men) in different treatment states. The analysis revealed a predominance of the attribute “reaching sustained virological response.” When considering confidence intervals, the results showed three different preference ranks. At first place was “sustained virological response” (level difference [LD] 3.98), second was “anemia” (LD 1.10), followed by “number of interferon injections” (LD 0.92), “rash” (LD 0.82), “nausea and/or diarrhea” (LD 0.79), and “duration of antiviral therapy” (LD 0.78). The last position was occupied by both “tiredness/fatigue” (LD 0.31) and “headache” (LD 0.34).
Conclusions
From the patients’ point of view, sustained virological response is the most essential criterion for choosing an HCV therapy. It was ranked at the highest, dominating all side effects and modes of administration. Furthermore, this study proved that patients consider both the probability of occurrence and the severity of treatment-induced side effects. Results clearly point to valuation of probabilities that is separate from that of severity.

AB  - Industrial cracking furnaces for ethene and ethylene dichloride (EDC) production are highly energy intensive. Much effort has been exerted toward achieving higher thermal efficiency and product yield. Numerical modeling has shown to be useful in furnace design and optimization. The advantage of numerical modeling over experiments is that a wider operating range can be simulated, allowing theoretical optimum to be found as guidance for practical. Industrial steam cracking furnaces have been extensively studied via numerical simulations over the past few decades, leading to many interesting results that offer deep insights into steam cracking processes. In this chapter, progress in the modeling of industrial cracking furnaces for both ethene and EDC production that has taken place in the last 5 years is reviewed. The discussion on ethene cracking furnaces includes fully coupled furnace-reactor simulations for the furnaces, the investigation of radiative heat transfer, the heat transfer and flow boiling of complex hydrocarbon feedstock in convection sections, and the integrated operation and cyclic scheduling optimization of cracking furnace systems. For the EDC cracking furnace, the effect of the fuel gas allocation factor, CCl4 concentration, on the run length of the furnace is presented. In addition to the recent advances in cracking furnace modeling, the problems encountered by the current furnace design in fulfilling the new requirements of higher efficiency and lower emission of NOx and CO2 are detailed. The alternative approaches, which may provide a better solution for this issue, are given, with a potential research focus on cracking furnace design and optimization that may occur in the future.

AB  - T-norm and T-conorm operators are successfully used for processing uncertainty in system analysis, decision analysis, control, modeling and forecasting applications. The complexity of real-world applications is that relevant information is partially reliable. In this regard, Prof. L.A. Zadeh suggested the concept of a Z-number as an ordered pair Z1+Z2 of fuzzy numbers used to describe a value of a random variable X, where A is a fuzzy constraint on values of X and B is a fuzzy reliability of A, and is considered as a value of probability measure of R2. However, processing of Z-number based information is at its initial stage of crystallization. In this paper we consider Z-number valued T-norm and T-conorm operators of Z-numbers. A real-world application is used to illustrate validity and efficiency of Z-number valued T-norm and T-conorm operators based processing of partially reliable information.

The tool is based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), namely the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), that allows users to rank possible solutions according to their requirements. In this study, we performed rankings of pairs of eight extraction and three dispersive solvents used in DLLME for chlorophenols extraction from water samples. The first ranking involved sensitivity and precision of the method for each of the nine chlorophenols. The tool is a quantitative solution to the common analytical problem that the change of analytical performance results in better performance for some analytes and worse for others. The second ranking included the assessment of the greenness of each pair of solvents, based on toxicological, ecotoxicological and environmental persistence criteria. The third ranking was based on a combination of sensitivity, precision and greenness criteria. Heptane as an extraction solvent and acetone as a dispersive solvent were selected as the most appropriate ones. The TOPSIS tool is a successful, easy to implement, incorporation of green analytical chemistry values to analytical method optimization.

KW  - SCOR® model
AB  - Evaluating suppliers and supporting their continuous improvement have become critical for supply chain (SC) performance management. Since the performance of an organization in a SC depends on the performance of its suppliers, it is desirable that the evaluation of a supplier can be integrated to the evaluation of the SC. Few studies propose decision making models to aid the supplier evaluation for development. However, these studies adopt criteria similar to ones used in supplier selection, which can lead to a mismatch between supplier and SC performance evaluations. Therefore, to overcome this lack of alignment, this article presents a new approach that uses the performance metrics of the SCOR® (Supply Chain Operations Reference) model to evaluate the suppliers in the dimensions cost and delivery performance. It combines two fuzzy TOPSIS models for evaluating and categorizing the suppliers in four groups depending on their performance evaluation. According to their categorization, directives for action plans are proposed. An illustrative application was developed based on a manufacturing context. The combination between the SCOR® and fuzzy TOPSIS brings several benefits when compared with other approaches, such as: it facilitates the integration of the processes of performance evaluation of the suppliers and the SC; it enables benchmarking against other SCs; the fuzzy TOPSIS requires few judgments to parameterization, which contributes to the agility of the decision process; it does not limit the number of alternatives simultaneously evaluated; it does not cause the ranking reversal problem when a new supplier is included in the evaluation process.

AB  - This paper proposes a new multicriteria decision making method to aid the choice and weighting of criteria to be used in the supplier selection process. The method combines the fuzzy QFD technique for weighting the criteria with a procedure for assessing the difficulty to obtain information to evaluate the suppliers on each criterion. The choice and weighting of the criteria derive from a systematic procedure based on the use of linguistic terms to judge the importance of the related requirements and the intensity of the relationship between requirements and criteria. In the final step, the proposed method classifies the criteria into four groups (priority, critical, complementary and costly) so as to guide the final choice of criteria. The method was implemented in Excel and applied to a pilot case in an automotive company, which classified the criteria into groups so as to guide the decision in the final selection. Competitive price, delivery in full on time, product conformance and quality certification were categorized into the priority group meaning that they should be used in the supplier selection process. On the other hand, commitment to cost reduction, financial situation, responsiveness to demand change, commitment to quality improvement and potential for collaboration were classified as critical, meaning that they are important but they require a bigger effort of data collection. The results of the application were considered by the decision makers as consistent and aligned with the strategic competitive priorities of the supply chain. Differently from other studies, the type of item as well as the type of supply chain was formally considered in the determination of the initial list of requirements and criteria. Moreover, final selection of the set of criteria is also dependent on the linguistic evaluation of the degree of difficulty of data collection.

AB  - Development of a Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) plan is a complex process. As a foundation and prerequisite for efficient MSWM plan, quantification and prediction of Solid Waste (SW) generation is very much essentials. Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) prediction cannot be done directly and depends on so many factors. In actual practices, due to uncertainties and unavailability of sufficient data, modelling methods are needed for prediction of MSW generation. A number of researchers have predicted SW generation using various modeling methods. The main objective of this paper is to review such models related to MSW generation using economic, socio-demographic or management-orientated data and identify possible factors that will help in selecting the crucial design options within the framework of mathematical modeling. Five characteristic classification criteria, namely, modeling method, area covered, time series, independent variables and waste streams are focused in this review. The entire published models are diverse in nature for application from whole country to households. Successful modeling depends significantly on selection of waste stream. From the review and discussion of models the research aims to identify the limitations of previous models which will help in identifying the crucial design options within the framework of modeling. The study is concluded with a few fruitful suggestions.

The set of relevant design decisions affects the quality of the software architecture. In this paper, a systematic decision-making framework is proposed by considering management and organizational factors and design goals/parameters that affect software architecture (SA) and integrating it with the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to evaluate and select the quality software architecture. An illustrative case study is also mentioned to show the applicability of the proposed framework. The framework suggested in the paper should enable an architect and other key stakeholders of the software architecture to efficiently identify, evaluate and select the software architecture.

Our goal is to pick a set of K items that maximize the total derived utility of all the agents (i.e., in our example we are to pick K movies that we put on the plane's entertainment system). However, the actual utility that an agent derives from a given item is only a fraction of its intrinsic one, and this fraction depends on how the agent ranks the item among the chosen, available, ones. We provide a formal specification of the model and provide concrete examples and settings where it is applicable. We show that the problem is hard in general, but we show a number of tractability results for its natural special cases.

AB  - This paper presents an efficiency assessment of the 114 Islamic banks from 24 countries using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). TOPSIS is a multicriteria decision making technique similar to Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which ranks a finite set of units based on the minimization of distance from an ideal point and the maximization of distance from an anti-ideal point. In this research, TOPSIS is used first in a two-stage approach to assess the relative efficiency of Islamic banks using the most frequent indicators adopted by the literature. Then, in the second stage, neural networks are combined with TOPSIS results as part of an attempt to produce a model for banking performance with effective predictive ability. The results reveal that variables related to both country origin and cost structure have a prominent impact on efficiency. Findings also indicate that the Islamic banking market would benefit from higher level of competition between institutions.

AB  - In this paper a novel road vectorization methodology based on image space clustering technique and weighted graph theory is presented. The proposed methodology describes a road as a set of optimized points on the centerline which should be connected by defining a number of appropriate criteria. The main contribution of this paper is to design a weighting scheme for combining a small number of road identities using Ordered Weighted Averaging (owa) operators by defining appropriate decision strategy. In this regard, a novel geometric criterion is introduced. Result of the OWA aggregation specifies weight of each edge in the road network graph. Comparing the proposed approach with two state-of-the-art image space clustering-based road vectorization methods proves its efficiency to deal with roads with different widths, parallel roads with different distances, different types of intersections, and also noise clusters. Obtaining improved quality measures for several high-resolution images, demonstrates the successfulness of the vectorization approach.

AB  - The decision of where to locate a dry port requires the analysis of the whole logistics supply chain, with the objective of transferring the largest volume of goods possible from road to more energy efficient means of transport, like rail or Short Sea Shipping, that are less harmful to the environment. However, such decision ought to cope also with the sustainability of the site inland. The objective of this article is to investigate the variables influencing sustainability of dry port location and how this sustainability can be evaluated. We propose a methodology based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). MCDA is used as a way to establish a scoring, whilst BNs were chosen to eliminate arbitrariness in setting the weightings using a technique that allows us to prioritize each variable according to the relationships established in the set of variables. In order to determine the relationships between all the variables involved in the decision, giving us the importance of each factor and variable, we built a K2 BN algorithm. To obtain the scores of each variable, we used a complete cartography analysed by ArcGIS. As case studies, the sustainability of all of the 10 existing dry ports in Spain has been evaluated. In this set of logistics platforms, we found that the most important variables for achieving sustainability are those related to environmental protection, so the sustainability of the locations requires a great respect for the natural environment and the urban environment in which they are framed.

AB  - A Bayesian belief network (BBN) was developed to assess preferred combinations of trees in live fences and on pastures in silvopastoral systems. The BBN was created with information from Rivas, Nicaragua, using local farmer knowledge on tree species, trees' costs and benefits, farmers' expressed needs and aspirations, and scientific knowledge regarding tree functional traits and their contribution to ecosystem services and benefits. The model identifies combinations of trees, which provide multiple ecosystem services from pastures, improving their productivity and contribution to farmer livelihoods. We demonstrate how the identification of portfolios of multifunctional trees can satisfy a profile of desired ecosystem services prioritized by the farmer. Diagnostics using Bayesian inference starts with an identification of farmer needs and ‘works backwards’ to identify a silvopastoral system structure. We conclude that Bayesian belief networks are a promising modeling technique for multi-criteria decisions in farm adaptation processes, where interventions must be adapted to specific contexts and farmer preferences.

Considering an arbitrary bounded lattice L, we show the existence of idempotent uninorms on L for any element e ∈ L\{0, 1} playing the role of a neutral element. By our construction method, we obtain the smallest idempotent uninorm and the greatest idempotent uninorm with the neutral element e ∈ L\{0, 1}. We see that the obtained uninorms are conjunctive and disjunctive uninorms, respectively. On the other hand, if L is not a chain, we also provide an example of an idempotent uninorm which is neither conjunctive nor disjunctive.

The statistic population of this study was 25 tractors in Ghaemshahr and Ahvaz, in that 15 tractors were chosen randomly, and the data were analyzed using AHP (analytic hierarchy process). The results showed that the maximum effect regarding the selection of tractor belonged to the maintenance with 49.4% and the minimum went to ergonomic effect with 7% in Ahvaz and the maximum effect was related to price with 29.6% and the minimum went to ergonomic effect with 6.8%. ITM285 and Romania 650 with 83% were the best tractors in Ahvaz and John Deere 6150 with 83% was the best tractor in Ghaemshahr city. Incompatibility ratio for all the comparisons was zero, so the criteria are completely compatible with the aims and options.

KW  - Multicriteria Decision Analysis
AB  - The global economic structure, with its decentralized production and the consequent increase in freight traffic all over the world, creates considerable problems and challenges for the freight transport sector. This situation has led shipping to become the most suitable and cheapest way to transport goods. Thus, ports are configured as nodes with critical importance in the logistics supply chain as a link between two transport systems, sea and land. Increase in activity at seaports is producing three undesirable effects: increasing road congestion, lack of open space in port installations and a significant environmental impact on seaports. These adverse effects can be mitigated by moving part of the activity inland. Implementation of dry ports is a possible solution and would also provide an opportunity to strengthen intermodal solutions as part of an integrated and more sustainable transport chain, acting as a link between road and railway networks. In this sense, implementation of dry ports allows the separation of the links of the transport chain, thus facilitating the shortest possible routes for the lowest capacity and most polluting means of transport. Thus, the decision of where to locate a dry port demands a thorough analysis of the whole logistics supply chain, with the objective of transferring the largest volume of goods possible from road to more energy efficient means of transport, like rail or short sea shipping, that are less harmful to the environment. However, the decision of where to locate a dry port must also ensure the sustainability of the site. Thus, the main goal of this article is to research the variables influencing the sustainability of dry port location and how this sustainability can be evaluated. With this objective, in this paper we present a methodology for assessing the sustainability of locations by the use of Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Bayesian Networks (BNs). MCDA is used as a way to establish a scoring, whilst BNs were chosen to eliminate arbitrariness in setting the weightings using a technique that allows us to prioritize each variable according to the relationships established in the set of variables. In order to determine the relationships between all the variables involved in the decision, giving us the importance of each factor and variable, we built a K2 BN algorithm. To obtain the scores of each variable, we used a complete cartography analysed by ArcGIS. Recognising that setting the most appropriate location to place a Dry Port is a geographical multidisciplinary problem, with significant economic, social and environmental implications, we consider 41 variables (grouped into 17 factors) which respond to this need. As a case of study, the sustainability of all of the 10 existing dry ports in Spain has been evaluated. In this set of logistics platforms, we found that the most important variables for achieving sustainability are those related to environmental protection, so the sustainability of the locations requires a great respect for the natural environment and the urban environment in which they are framed.

AB  - The development of strategies for biodiversity analysis is critical at several levels, particularly at the national one. The World Conference on Biological Diversity held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the European Natura 2000 network and the Environmental Conference of the Regions of Europe (EN.CO.RE) brought forward several measures aiming at the preservation of Biodiversity. Targets for biodiversity preservation include protected areas among others. Accordingly, the analysis of the degree of biodiversity of protected areas proves to be a valid tool to evaluate the effectiveness of those measures. The present manuscript analyses the degree of some relevant features of biodiversity in the Region of Tuscany, through the implementation of multidimensional indicators in a Spatial MultiCriteria Analysis. After a state of the art of biodiversity definition, four indicators have been used for the analysis. A raster map in which pixels have higher or lower values of biodiversity was produced in order to investigate which of these values might be located in protected areas. Protected areas with high value of biodiversity confirmed that the adopted environmental policies are positively related to the conservation of biodiversity. The result of the analysis, corroborated through auto-correlational statistical analysis, has highlighted the important role of protected areas in maintaining a certain degree of biodiversity.

AB  - Evaluating the efficiency of innovation systems can serve as a substantial enabling tool for policymaking serving to identify best practices and develop potential improvements of actions and strategies. It also serves to provide valuable insight in understanding the nature and dynamics of innovation process at its different stages and levels. The main aim of the paper is to present an integrated assessment and classification framework for national and regional innovation efficiency. The proposed model is based on Data Envelopment Analysis and is formulated as a multiobjective mathematical program in order to consider the objectives and constraints of the different stages and levels of the innovation process. Additionally, the model copes with DEA inconsistencies when ratio measures are employed. In the second part of the study, a multicriteria decision aid approach, based on an ordinal regression model, is applied in order to study how environmental factors on innovation and entrepreneurship affect the estimated efficiency scores. The proposed approach is applied to a set of 23 European countries and their 185 corresponding regions. The results show that there are large differences regarding the efficiency scores of the different stages and levels, implying the existence of significant divergences from the expected norm concerning innovation efficiency. The contribution of the paper lies (i) in the proposed multiobjective model, which is able to model the multiple stages and levels of the innovation process and handle ratio measures without requiring the same set of inputs and outputs at different levels and (ii) in the presented application of the model in the efficiency evaluation of innovation systems, including a meta-analysis of the results based on the framework of the Quadruple Innovation Helix. Such an approach may provide a valuable tool for country/region comparison and policy formulation.

AB  - This paper presents an efficiency assessment of the Malaysian Islamic banks using TOPSIS. In this research, this technique is applied first in a two-stage approach to assess the relative efficiency of Malaysian Islamic banks using the most frequent indicators found in the banking literature. Besides, in the second stage, neural networks are combined with TOPSIS results as part of an attempt to produce a model for banking performance with effective predictive ability. The results reveal that variables related to cost structure have a prominent negative impact on efficiency levels, although some parsimony in equity leveraging derived from Islamic finance principles maybe helpful in achieving higher efficiency levels. Findings also indicate that the Malaysian Islamic banking market also imposes cultural and regulatory barriers to foreign banks, so that their efficiency levels are lower when compared to their national counterparts. Learning curves (trend impact) are relevant in predicting efficiency levels.

AB  - Modern technology products are becoming more advanced, complex, and expensive, necessitating the use of failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) to stabilize production and enhance market competitiveness. Traditional FMEA adopts the risk priority number (RPN) to stabilize production and monitor risks of failure. The RPN has 3 parameters—severity (S), occurrence (O), and detection (D)—which are used to assess and prioritize potential risks in production. Although the traditional RPN is efficient, it has several shortcomings. For example, it assumes that weighting factors have equal weight, it fails to examine the nature of problems stepwise and structurally, available information can be lost easily, and priority orders are assessed identically with high frequency. Thus, to improve the RPN, we propose an integrated method, combining multiattribute failure mode analysis (MAFMA) and 2-tuple representation, called generalized multiattribute failure mode analysis (GMAFMA). This study uses a TFT-LCD product of a technology company in Taiwan as an actual case study and compares the RPN, MAFMA, and GMAFMA by numerical verification, demonstrating that the disadvantages above are improved and obtaining a more reasonable assessment of risk priority. This method provides references that enhance process stability and reduce the risk of failure for managers.

AB  - In recent years, the group ranking problem has become an important subject of study. In most group ranking problems, the focus is on identifying consensuses. No previous research has involved identifying conflicting opinions, called conflict patterns in this paper, among decision-makers. We define conflict patterns as orderings of alternatives that have roughly the same numbers of advantages and disadvantages. Conflict patterns can reveal the ranking of which alternatives are the most controversial among decision-makers and who the supporters and opponents are. Using conflict pattern data, decision-makers can communicate with people with differing opinions and attempt to resolve the differences. In this study, an algorithm, Mining Conflict Patterns, was developed to identify conflict patterns from users’ partial ranking data. Extensive experiments were conducted using synthetic and real data sets. The results indicate that the proposed method is computationally efficient and can effectively identify conflict patterns among all users.

AB  - This study demonstrates the application of the Dominance principle to a particular case of web (World Wide Web) content search under Multi-criteria approach: searching for “Rio de Janeiro” (City and/or State, in Brazil) followed by other attributes (or criteria). It is known that depending on the content of research that is carried out through a “seeker” (“search engine”) on the Internet, the result may fall short of the desirable, in terms of quantity and quality of the sites returned. The Dominance principle, subsequent to treatment of the collected information (unstructured data) on the Internet, aimed at revealing patterns (or logical rules) on a set of information and showed how a web content search can become more effective at a significant universe of information. Other techniques and tools have been applied to mining content on the Web, and as shown in this study. The choice of the Dominance principle associated to Rough Set Theory as Multi-criteria decision technique is due to the possibility of inaccurate data (inconsistent) and the need for treatment of these inaccuracies when processing an information system (data table) under a mathematical perspective, and do not need a history of these data. The use of Rough Set Theory and the Dominance principle associated with the probabilistic relationship between conditions and decisions in decision algorithms, is showed by the possibility of there being uncertain data to yield an essential set of effectively consistent information.

AB  - Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a valuable resource within operations research and management science. Various MCDA methods have been developed over the years and applied to decision problems in many different areas. The outranking approach, and in particular the family of ELECTRE methods, continues to be a popular research field within MCDA, despite its more than 40 years of existence. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review of English scholarly papers on ELECTRE and ELECTRE-based methods is performed. Our aim is to investigate how ELECTRE and ELECTRE-based methods have been considered in various areas. This includes area of applications, modifications to the methods, comparisons with other methods, and general studies of the ELECTRE methods. Although a significant amount of literature on ELECTRE is in a language different from English, we focus only on English articles, because many researchers may not be able to perform a study in some of the other languages. Each paper is categorized according to its main focus with respect to ELECTRE, i.e. if it considers an application, performs a review, considers ELECTRE with respect to the problem of selecting an MCDA method or considers some methodological aspects of ELECTRE. A total of 686 papers are included in the review. The group of papers considering an application of ELECTRE consists of 544 papers, and these are further categorized into 13 application areas and a number of sub-areas. In addition, all papers are classified according to the country of author affiliation, journal of publication, and year of publication. For the group of applied papers, the distribution by ELECTRE version vs. application area and ELECTRE version vs. year of publication are provided. We believe that this paper can be a valuable source of information for researchers and practitioners in the field of MCDA and ELECTRE in particular.

AB  - Sustainable remediation requires a balanced decision-making process in which environmental, economic and social aspects of different remediation options are all considered together and the optimum remediation solution is selected. More attention has been paid to the evaluation of environmental and economic aspects, in particular to reduce the human and environmental risks and the remediation costs, to the exclusion of social aspects of remediation. This paper investigates how social aspects are currently considered in sustainability assessments of remediation projects. A selection of decision support tools (DSTs), used for the sustainability assessment of a remediation project, is analyzed to define how social aspects are considered in those tools. The social indicator categories of the Sustainable Remediation Forum – United Kingdom (SuRF-UK), are used as a basis for this evaluation. The consideration of social aspects in the investigated decision support tools is limited, but a clear increase is noticed in more recently developed tools. Among the five social indicator categories defined by SuRF-UK to facilitate a holistic consideration of social aspects of a remediation project only “Human health and safety” is systematically taken into account. “Neighbourhood and locality” is also often addressed, mostly emphasizing the potential disturbance caused by the remediation activities. However, the evaluation of ‘Ethics and Equality’, Communities and community involvement’, and ‘Uncertainty and evidence’ is often neglected. Nevertheless, concrete examples can be found in some of the investigated tools. Specific legislation, standard procedures, and guidelines that have to be followed in a region or country are mainly been set up in the context of protecting human and ecosystem health, safety and prevention of nuisance. However, they sometimes already include some of the aspects addressed by the social indicators. In this perspective the use of DST to evaluate the sustainability of a site remediation project, should be tuned to the legislation, guidelines and procedures that are in force in a specific country or region.

AB  - Microfinance institutions provide loans to low-income individuals. Their credit scoring systems, if they exist, are strictly financial. Although many institutions consider the social and environmental impact of their loans, they do not incorporate formal systems to estimate these social and environmental impacts. This paper proposes that their creditworthiness evaluations should be coherent with their social mission and, accordingly, should estimate the social and environmental impact of microcredit. Thus, a decision support system to facilitate microcredit granting is proposed using a multicriteria evaluation. The assessment of social impact is performed by calculating the Social Net Present Value. The system captures credit officers' experience and addresses incomplete and intangible information. The model has been tested in a microfinance institution. The paper shows how a small institution can include social and environmental issues in its decision-making systems to evaluate credit applications. A gap in the preferences was found between members of the board, who are socially driven, and managers and credit officers, who are financially drifted. This mission drift was corrected. The approach followed contributed to creating a culture of social and environmental assessment within the institution, especially among credit officers, thereby translating Microfinance institutions' social mission into numbers.

AB  - The invariant recognition of 2D binary images is the main subject of the paper. Two methods for invariant pattern recognition based on 2D Fourier power spectrum with guaranteed translation invariance are proposed. First method introduce the features invariant to translation, scaling, rotation and mirroring (TSO invariance). The second method introduces the features invariant to general affine transform (A invariance). The methods are used to obtain TSO/A invariant spectra except of the rotation effect which are analysed on circular paths with fixed radii. Harmonic analysis of power fluctuations around paths generates Fourier coefficients and their square absolute values are used as TSO/A invariant descriptors. The proposed methods were tested on two large sets of 2D digital images of tree leaves. After TSO/A invariant processing of thresholded digital images, kernel Support Vector Machine or self-organizing neural network were used for leaf categorisation.

In this article, we present an entirely new method for rule extraction in knowledge-based systems that consists in retrieving an initial set of rules extracted from a knowledge base using conventional logical approaches and then ranking this initial set of rules applying a psychologically motivated multicriteria decision analysis method. We show how this method can be used to implement a knowledge-based management system, demonstrate that this method outperforms the most efficient algorithms for rule extraction proposed to date in the knowledge representation and knowledge discovery fields, and describe its implementation in a knowledge-based innovation tutoring system.

AB  - This paper aims to ease group decision-making by using an integration of fuzzy AHP (analytic hierarchy process) and fuzzy TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) and its application to software selection of an electronic firm. Firstly, priority values of criteria in software selection problem have been determined by using fuzzy extension of AHP method. Fuzzy extension of AHP is suggested in this paper because of little computation time and much simpler than other fuzzy AHP procedures. Then, the result of the fuzzy TOPSIS model can be employed to define the most appropriate alternative with regard to this firm's goals in uncertain environment. Fuzzy numbers are presented in all phases in order to overcome any vagueness in decision making process. The final decision depends on the degree of importance of each decision maker so that wrong degree of importance causes the mistaken result. The researchers generally determine the degrees of importance of each decision maker according to special characteristics of each decision maker as subjectivity. In order to overcome this subjectivity in this paper, the judgments of decision makers are degraded to unique decision by using an attribute based aggregation technique. There is no study about software selection using integrated fuzzy AHP-fuzzy TOPSIS approach with group decision-making based on an attribute based aggregation technique. The results of the proposed approach and the other approaches are compared. Results indicate that our methodology allows decreasing the uncertainty and the information loss in group decision making and thus, ensures a robust solution to the firm.

This new method uses natural language processing (NLP) essential techniques, a sentiment lexicon enhanced with the assistance of SentiWordNet, and fuzzy sets to estimate the semantic orientation polarity and its intensity for sentences, which provides a foundation for computing with sentiments. The proposed hybrid method is applied to three different data-sets and the results achieved are compared to those obtained using Naïve Bayes and Maximum Entropy techniques. It is demonstrated that the presented hybrid approach is more accurate and precise than both Naïve Bayes and Maximum Entropy techniques, when the latter are utilised in isolation. In addition, it is shown that when applied to datasets containing snippets, the proposed method performs similarly to state of the art techniques.

AB  - A novel method has been proposed for the detection of ischemia using an isoelectric energy function (IEEF) resulting from ST segment deviations in ECG signals. The method consists of five stages: pre-processing, delineation, measurement of isoelectric energy, a beat characterization algorithm and detection of ischemia. The isoelectric energy threshold is used to differentiate ischemic beats from normal beats for ischemic episode detection. Then, ischemic episodes are classified as transmural or subendocardial. The method is validated for recordings of the annotated European ST-T database (EDB). The results show 98.12% average sensitivity (SE) and 98.16% average specificity (SP). These results are significantly better than those of existing methods cited in the literature. The advantage of the proposed method includes simplicity, ruggedness and automatic discarding of noisy beats.

AB  - Because of the increased volume of information available to physicians from advanced medical technology, the obtained information of each symptom with respect to a disease may contain truth, falsity and indeterminacy information. Since a single-valued neutrosophic set (SVNS) consists of the three terms like the truth-membership, indeterminacy-membership and falsity-membership functions, it is very suitable for representing indeterminate and inconsistent information. Then, similarity measure plays an important role in pattern recognition and medical diagnosis. However, existing medical diagnosis methods can only handle the single period medical diagnosis problem, but cannot deal with the multi-period medical diagnosis problems with neutrosophic information. Hence, the purpose of this paper was to propose similarity measures between SVNSs based on tangent function and a multi-period medical diagnosis method based on the similarity measure and the weighted aggregation of multi-period information to solve multi-period medical diagnosis problems with single-valued neutrosophic information. Then, we compared the tangent similarity measures of SVNSs with existing similarity measures of SVNSs by a numerical example about pattern recognitions to indicate the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed similarity measures. In the multi-period medical diagnosis method, we can find a proper diagnosis for a patient by the proposed similarity measure between the symptoms and the considered diseases represented by SVNSs and the weighted aggregation of multi-period information. Then, a multi-period medical diagnosis example was presented to demonstrate the application of the proposed diagnosis method and to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis method by the comparative analysis. The diagnosis results showed that the developed multi-period medical diagnosis method can help doctors make a proper diagnosis by the comprehensive information of multi-periods.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to propose an approach to support group multicriteria classification. The approach is composed of three phases. The first phase exploits the knowledge provided by each decision maker to individually approximate the decision classes using rough approximation. The second phase seeks to combine the outputs of individual approximation phase into a collective decision table by using an appropriate aggregation procedure. The third phase uses the collective decision table in order to infer a set of collective decision rules, which synthesize the judgements and perspectives of the different decision makers and to permit the classification of all decision objects. The proposed approach relies on the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA), which is used at two different levels. First, the DRSA is used during the first phase to approximate the input data relative to each decision maker. Second, the DRSA is used during the third phase to approximate the collective decision table and generate the collective decision rules. This paper presents the theoretical foundation of the proposed approach, three case studies using real-world data and a comparative study of recent similar proposals.

AB  - The amount of data collected from different real-world applications is increasing rapidly. When the volume of data is too large to be loaded to memory, it may be impossible to analyze it using a single computer. Although efforts have been taken to manage big data by using a single computer, the problem may not be solved in an acceptable time frame, making parallel computing an indispensable way to handle big data. In this paper, we investigate approaches to attribute reduction in parallel using dominance-based neighborhood rough sets (DNRS), which take into consideration the partial orders among numerical and categorical attribute values, and can be utilized in a multicriteria decision-making method. We first present some properties of attribute reduction in DNRS, and then investigate principles of parallel attribute reduction in DNRS. Parallelization on different components of attribute reduction are explored in detail. Furthermore, parallel attribute reduction algorithms in DNRS are proposed. Experimental results on UCI data and big data show that the proposed parallel algorithm is both effective and efficient.

AB  - Metamodeling techniques have been developed and used for years in engineering reliability analysis involving expensive response simulations. In practical tunnel engineering problems where finite element (FE) simulations are required, the limited state/performance functions are in general implicit and nonlinear, and it is difficult to apply traditional gradient-based or sampling-based reliability methods, especially for large-scale problems. There is a need to develop accurate and efficient metamodels for practical tunnel engineering applications. In this paper, a metamodeling technique for reliability analysis of tunnels was studied based on augmented radial basis functions (RBFs). With a relatively small size of samples, the RBFs were used to create accurate approximate functions for different types of responses including linear and higher-order nonlinear functions. With the RBF-based metamodel constructed to express a limit state/performance function, Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) were applied to evaluate failure probability. The failure probability and reliability index obtained using the RBF-based metamodeling method were found to have good accuracy with a reasonable number of sample points. The reliability analyses of two existing tunnel examples showed that the augmented RBF metamodeling approach was efficient and effective for tunnel engineering problems.

AB  - Using pipelines to transport fuels is considered safe and financially viable. Multicriteria decision models are used as they lead to managing risk better and to more effective decision-making when assessing risk to hydrogen pipelines. Nevertheless, there is recurring concern about the possibility of accidents occurring due to failures in the storage structure and/or when transporting hydrogen. Given the uncertainties inherent when using these models, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted and the results are analysed based on Kendalls τ correlation coefficient. This coefficient was fundamental for understanding the behaviour of different rankings obtained by simulations, since information was generated on ranges of uncertainty and on recommendations to decision-makers. The article suggests steps on how best to conduct a sensitivity analysis and to ensure that results are robust, based on a model that uses graphs within Information visualization that support the decision-maker when ranking pipeline sections and to mitigate risks.

AB  - Group decision making situations are part of today's organizations. It is a type of decision making involving many decision makers which act collectively to choose the best alternative (or alternatives) from a set of feasible alternatives. Usually, numerical values have been used by the decision makers to express their opinions on the possible alternatives. However, as the standard representation of the concepts that humans use for communication is the natural language, words or linguistic terms instead of numerical values should be used by the decision makers to provide their preferences. In such a situation, the linguistic information has to be made operational in order to be fully utilized. In this contribution, assuming that decision makers express their opinions by using linguistic terms, we present an information granulation of such a type of information, which is formulated as an optimization problem in which consistency is maximized by a suitable mapping of the linguistic terms on information granules.

AB  - In this paper, an intelligent adaptive tracking control system (IATCS) based on the mixed H2/H∞ approach under uncertain plant parameters and external disturbances for achieving high precision performance of a two-axis motion control system is proposed. The two-axis motion control system is an X–Y table driven by two permanent-magnet linear synchronous motors (PMLSMs) servo drives. The proposed control scheme incorporates a mixed H2/H∞ controller, a self-organizing recurrent fuzzy-wavelet-neural-network controller (SORFWNNC) and a robust controller. The combinations of these control methods would insure the stability, robustness, optimality, overcome the uncertainties, and performance properties of the two-axis motion control system. The SORFWNNC is used as the main tracking controller to adaptively estimate an unknown nonlinear dynamic function that includes the lumped parameter uncertainties, external disturbances, cross-coupled interference and frictional force. Moreover, the structure and the parameter learning phases of the SORFWNNC are performed concurrently and online. Furthermore, a robust controller is designed to deal with the uncertainties, including the approximation error, optimal parameter vectors and higher order terms in Taylor series. Besides, the mixed H2/H∞ controller is designed such that the quadratic cost function is minimized and the worst case effect of the unknown nonlinear dynamic function on the tracking error must be attenuated below a desired attenuation level. The mixed H2/H∞ control design has the advantage of both H2 optimal control performance and H∞ robust control performance. The sufficient conditions are developed for the adaptive mixed H2/H∞ tracking problem in terms of a pair of coupled algebraic equations instead of coupled nonlinear differential equations. The coupled algebraic equations can be solved analytically. The online adaptive control laws are derived based on Lyapunov theorem and the mixed H2/H∞ tracking performance so that the stability of the proposed IATCS can be guaranteed. Furthermore, the control algorithms are implemented in a DSP-based control computer. From the experimental results, the motions at X-axis and Y-axis are controlled separately, and the dynamic behaviors of the proposed IATCS can achieve favorable tracking performance and are robust to parameter uncertainties.

AB  - This paper is a comprehensive and updated overview of river restoration and covers all relevant aspects from drivers of restoration, linkages between hydromorphology and biota, the current restoration paradigm, effects of restorations to future directions and ways forward in the way we conduct river restoration. A large part of this paper is based on the outcomes of the REFORM (REstoring rivers FOR effective catchment Management, http://reformrivers.eu/) project that was funded by EU's 7th Framework Programme (2011–15). REFORM included the most comprehensive comparison, to date, of existing river restorations across Europe and their effect on biota, both in relation to preintervention state and project size in terms of river length restored. The REFORM project outcomes are supplemented by an extensive literature review and two case studies to illustrate key points. We conclude that river restorations conducted up until now have had highly variable effects with, on balance, more positives than negatives. The largest positive effects have interestingly been in terrestrial and semiaquatic organism groups, in widening projects, while positive effects on truly aquatic organisms groups are only seen when in-stream measures are applied. The positive responses of biota are primarily seen as increased abundance of organisms with very little indication that overall biodiversity has increased: specific traits rather than mere species number or total abundance have benefited from restoration interventions. This modest success rate can partly be attributed to the fact that the catchment filter is largely ignored; large-scale pressures related to catchment land use or the lack of source populations for the recolonisation of the restored habitats are inadequately considered. The key reason for this shortfall is a lack of clear objective setting and planning processes. Furthermore, we suggest that there has been a focus on form rather than processes and functioning in river restoration, which has truncated the evolution of geomorphic features and any dynamic interaction with biota. Finally, monitoring of restoration outcomes is still rare and often uses inadequate statistical designs and inappropriate biological methods which hamper our ability to detect change.

AB  - Multi criteria decision making (MCDM) is one of the research areas of operations research and management science which has widely studied by researchers and practitioners. It finds a compromise solution for evaluating and ranking alternatives from the best to the worst under conflicting criteria with respect to decision maker(s) preferences. In a compromise approach, the VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR; that means multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution) continues to be applied satisfactorily across different application areas. This paper conducts a state-of-the-art literature review to categorize, analyze and interpret the current research on VIKOR applications. It also discusses the extensions of VIKOR applied in fuzzy environments. A total of 343 papers are classified into 13 different application areas and a number of sub-application areas. Furthermore, all papers are also categorized with respect to publication year, published journal, country of origin, application type (real case study vs empirical study), and version of fuzzy sets used. This comprehensive literature review provides an insight for researchers and practitioners on VIKOR applications in terms of showing current state and potential areas for future attempts to be focused in the future.

AB  - The size of the pharmaceutical market and its contribution to the regional, national and international economic development is widely recognized. This fact indicates that supported and efficient decision making in the sector is a matter of paramount importance. This paper proposes a multicriteria assessment system to support top management of a real multinational pharmaceutical company over the investment on new pharmaceutical products. The evaluation criteria are extracted from three points of view, namely: (i) current market situation, (ii) development of the sector over the recent years, and (iii) comparison with other European countries. This research work results in the evaluation and ranking of 192 therapeutic categories for investment purposes in the Greek pharmaceutical market. The ranking of these categories is obtained through the application of an additive value model, which is assessed by the ordinal regression method UTASTAR. In the first phase, the decision makers are asked to rank a sample of these alternatives, inferring therefore implicitly a personal additive value system. In the second phase, all the alternatives are evaluated and a complete ranking is obtained. Finally, the robustness of the results is analysed and measured, given the imperfect determination of the model parameters. For this purpose, an extreme ranking analysis is implemented, calculating each alternative’s best and worst possible position in the ranking.

AB  - Traffic noise is gaining importance in planning and operation of roads in developing countries, and particularly in Europe and Latin America. Many variables with different degrees of importance influence the perception of noise from roads. Thus, the problem of prioritizing road stretches for action against such noise is an important issue in environmental noise management. For example, it can be addressed using multicriteria methods. However, these methodologies require criteria or suitable variables to be ranked according to their relative importance. In the present study, for this ranking, a list of nine variables involved in the decision-making process (called “road stretch priority variables”) was presented in the form of questionnaires to high-level experts from Andalusia, southern Spain. These experts ranked the variables by relevance. Using the same data, seven social choice functions (Plurality, Raynaud, Kemeny-Young, Copeland, Simpson, Schulze, and Borda) were used in order to rank the variables. The results indicate that the most important variables were those that take into account the parameters of greatest exposure for the citizens, followed by variables related to the intensity of the problem analyzed. The results show that a combination of the use of social choice functions on aggregated information from expert panels can provide a consensus for ranking priority variables related to road stretches.

AB  - Thermal load is defined as: the amount of cold water, hot water and steam used for air conditioning in a district heating and cooling (DHC) system. Thermal load prediction in DHC systems is one of the key technologies for economical and safe operations of DHC systems. The thermal load prediction method, through a simplified robust filter and a three-layered neural network, has been used in an actual DHC plant on a trial basis. Unfortunately, however, there exists a drawback that its prediction becomes less accurate in periods when the thermal load is non-stationary. In this chapter, for adapting the dynamical variation of thermal load together with a new kind of input data in consideration of the characteristics of thermal load data, a novel prediction method through a recurrent neural network (RNN) is presented. Furthermore, with the improvement of thermal load prediction methods for DHC systems, operational planning problems of DHC plants have been formulated as mixed 0–1 programming; mixed integer linear programming; and nonlinear 0–1 programming, and approximate solution methods through genetic algorithms have been presented. At present, however, the state of instruments in operation can be continuously controlled as the operating ratio, by the development of those instruments. It is imperative that there is a reduction of energy consumption, as well as minimization of the running costs. In this chapter, operational planning problems of DHC plants are formulated as multiobjective nonlinear programming ones, to minimize not only the running costs but also the primary energy, with the introduction of inverter controllers. Having introduced the fuzzy goals of the decision-maker for objective functions, an ‘interactive fuzzy satisficing method’ through particle swarm optimization is presented for deriving a satisficing solution for the decision-maker.

AB  - In this paper, a general event-triggered framework is set up to deal with the variance-constrained H∞ control problem for a class of discrete time-varying systems with randomly occurring saturations, stochastic nonlinearities and state-multiplicative noises. Based on the relative error with respect to the measurement signal, an event indicator variable is introduced and the corresponding event-triggered scheme is proposed in order to determine whether the measurement output is transmitted to the controller or not. The stochastic nonlinearities under consideration are characterized by statistical means which can cover several classes of well-studied nonlinearities. A set of unrelated random variables is exploited to govern the phenomena of randomly occurring saturations, stochastic nonlinearities and state-dependent noises. The purpose of the addressed multiobjective control problem is to design a set of time-varying output feedback controller such that, over a finite horizon, the closed-loop system achieves both the prescribed H∞ noise attenuation level and the state covariance constraints. A recursive matrix inequality approach is developed to derive the sufficient conditions for the existence of the desired finite-horizon controllers, and the analytical characterization of such controllers is also given. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed controller design scheme.

AB  - Collaboration planning among city logistics operators is important to achieve operational efficiency under municipal freight regulations such as access, sizing and timing restrictions etc. In this paper, we present a fuzzy BOCR–GRA approach for collaboration partner selection for city logistics planning under the presence of municipal freight regulations. A multi-step approach is proposed. In the first step, we identify collaboration partner evaluation criteria using BOCR framework. In the second step, linguistic assessment of criteria and alternatives (collaboration partners) is performed by a decision making committee. The linguistic data is treated via fuzzy triangular numbers for analytical processing. In the third step, alternatives are ranked using Gray Relational Analysis technique (GRA) and five BOCR scoring methods. The different alternative ranks are subject to veto and the alternative(s) with highest top ranks are considered for sensitivity analysis whereby we analyze the influence of changes in criteria weights and scoring methods on their ranks. If the rankings remain unchanged, then the veto retained alternative(s) are declared as winner(s) and recommended for collaboration. A numerical application is provided. This is one of the first works to address the collaboration partner selection problem in the context of city logistics under limited or lack of quantitative data. A comprehensive set of criteria are proposed and the best solution is generated using veto role on various scores obtained from BOCR and fuzzy GRA, thereby eliminating any bias arising from method selection.

The existing works are devoted to solving this problem under deterministic, stochastic, interval-based and fuzzy information. Unfortunately, up today no systematic research on supplier selection under partial reliability of information is proposed. In this paper we suggest new method for solving supplier selection problem under fuzzy and partially reliable information formalized by using Z-numbers. The method is based on determination of Z-number valued ideal and negative ideal solutions. A numerical example is provided to illustrate validity of the proposed approach to supplier selection problem.

AB  - Brazil has an increasing rate of e-waste generation, but there are currently few adequate management systems in operation, with the largest share of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) going to landfill sites or entering informal chains. The National Solid Waste Policy (2010) enforces the implementation of reverse logistics systems under the shared responsibility of consumers, companies and governments. The objective of this paper is to assess sustainability and prioritise system alternatives for potential implementation in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. Sustainability criteria and decision alternatives were defined by elicitation of stakeholders. The adopted multicriteria approach combines Life Cycle Assessment with qualitative evaluations by a small sample of regional experts with knowledge of the problem. The recommended system consists of a hybrid WEEE collection scheme with delivery points at shops, metro stations and neighbourhood centres; a pre-treatment phase with the involvement of private companies, cooperatives and social enterprises; and full recycling of all components in the country.

AB  - Developed and optimized a validated isocratic reverse phase HPLC separation of Rosuvastatin, Telmisartan, Ezetimibe and Atorvastatin in pharmaceutical preparation using response surface methodology. The separation was carried out by using phenomenex C18 column (15cm×4.6mm id, 5μm particle size) and UV detection at 239nm. The ranges of the independent variables used for the optimization were MeCN: 33–38%, buffer conc.: 10–20mM and flow rate: 1–2ml/min. The influence of these independent variables on the output responses: capacity factor of the first peak (k1), resolutions of the 2nd and 3rd peak (Rs2,3), and capacity factor of the fifth peak (k5) were evaluated. Using this strategy, a mathematical model was defined and a response surface was derived for the separation. The three responses were simultaneously optimized by using Derringer's desirability functions. Optimum conditions chosen for the assay were MeCN, MeOH, 20mM K2HPO4 (pH 3.0±0.2) solution (34.27:20:45.73 v/v/v) and flow rate 2ml/min. Total chromatographic analysis time per sample was approximately 10min. The optimized assay condition was validated as per the ICH guidelines and applied for the quantitative analysis of Rosavel EZ, Avas-EZ and Lipisar 20 tablet. The developed method was simple, accurate and precise. Hence, it can be employed for the routine analysis in quality control laboratories.

AB  - This paper presents the impact assessment of optimally placed different types of distributed generations (DGs) such as DG-1(T1), DG-2 (T2), DG-3 (T3), and DG-4 (T4) with different load models (DMLs) by using genetic algorithm (GA) in distribution power systems (DPSs) from minimum total mega volt ampere (MVA) intake viewpoint of main substation. This paper also presents the impact assessment of optimally placed same kind of DGssuch as DG-2(T2) and DG-4(T4) operating at different power factors (varies from 0.80 to 0.99 leading and lagging, respectively) with DLMs by GA in DPSs from minimum total MVA intake viewpoint of main substation. Different power system (PS) performance indices such as minimization of real power loss, minimization of reactive power loss, improvement of voltage profile, reduction of short circuit current or MVA line capacity and reduction in the emission of environmental greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matters and in emergency like conditions such as under fault, sudden change in field excitation of alternators or load increased in DPSs are calculated. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is illustrated on IEEE-37 bus distribution test system. This research article is very much useful for practitioners working on the implementation of renewable and building of future electricity grids and also includes the different PS performance indicators from better social welfare, reduced in the environmental pollutants emission, improved the technical issues, reduced the economical burden, and betters the security viewpoints.
