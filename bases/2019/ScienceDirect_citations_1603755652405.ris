KW  - Cost-benefit analysis
AB  - Food waste is a significant contemporary issue in the UK, with substantial environmental, social and economic costs to the nation. Whilst efforts to reduce food waste are laudable, a significant proportion of food and drink manufacturer waste is unavoidable. On the one hand, there is a drive from industry to reclaim as much value from this waste as possible, for example, by conversion to valuable products in what is known as “valorisation”. At the same time, growing social and legislative pressures mean that any attempts to valorise food waste must be performed in a sustainable manner. However, for every company and its specific food wastes, there will be multiple valorisation possibilities and few tools exist that allow food and drink manufacturers to identify which is most profitable and sustainable for them. Such a decision would need to not only consider environmental, social and economic performance, but also how ready the technology is and how well it aligns with that company's strategy. In response, this paper develops and presents a hybrid framework that guides a company in modelling the volumes/seasonality of its wastes, identifying potential valorisation options and selecting appropriate indicators for environmental, social and economic performance as well as technological maturity and alignment with company goals. The framework guides users in analyzing economic and environmental performance using Cost-Benefit Analysis and Life Cycle Assessment respectively. The results can then be ranked alongside those for social performance, technological maturity and alignment with company goals using a weighted sum model variant of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to facilitate easy visual comparison. This framework is demonstrated in the form of a case study with a major UK fruit consolidator to identify the optimal strategy for managing their citrus waste. Possibilities identified included sale of imperfect but still edible waste via wholesale at a significantly reduced profit and the investment in facilities to extract higher value pectin from the same waste stream using a microwave assisted pectin extraction process. Results suggest that continued sale of waste to wholesale markets is currently the most beneficial in terms of economic viability and environmental performance, but that in the medium to long term, the projected growth in the market for pectin suggests this could become the most viable strategy.

AB  - When a government or a municipality intends to incentivize electromobility a chicken-egg problem arises: shall citizens first buy electric vehicles or should the charging stations be installed first? Often, a charging infrastructure is deployed, even if the number of electric vehicles is small, in the hope to stimulate a larger interest in electric mobility. In such cases, charging station operators in collaboration with municipalities have to make appropriate decisions, including finding the placement of charging stations that meets the demands of electric vehicles (EVs) while expending the resources efficiently. In this paper, a data set coming from a large network of charging stations, located in one of the worlds electromobility leading countries the Netherlands, is analysed. Dataset comprises over one million charging transactions, more than 1700 charging stations and spans over four years. First, methodological tools to describe the urban context by data are introduced. Publicly available GIS data are collected and exploited to assess the geographical locations of charging stations. Data preprocessing procedures are described and their limitations are discussed. Finally, using correlation analysis the ability of the gathered GIS predictors to explain the utilization characteristics of EV charging stations is evaluated.

AB  - An effective risk management procedure can counterbalance critical effects on supply chains. Computer applications, optimization and simulation techniques have been applied to improve the decision-making process. The purpose of this article is to analyze the role and contribution of simulation and optimization methods for the supply chain risk management approach. A systematic literature review process was performed, followed by discussions and analysis on the examined topic. The results revealed a key methodological disconnection involving risk management phases, simulation and optimization methods. Although the number of published papers on the topic has been significant, this gap highlights the limitations of several models to represent the dynamics and complexity of the risks in supply chains, particularly on real-world/real-time applications. Hybrid and flexible simulation-based optimization models for supply chain risk management could improve the decision-making process. In addition, gaps, a procedural framework, and future research directions are suggested aiming to develop new applications focused on simulation and optimization tools for risk mitigation proposes.

AB  - The symbiotic organisms search algorithm is a very promising recent metaheuristic algorithm. It has received a plethora of attention from all areas of numerical optimization research, as well as engineering design practices. it has since undergone several modifications, either in the form of hybridization or as some other improved variants of the original algorithm. However, despite all the remarkable achievements and rapidly expanding body of literature regarding the symbiotic organisms search algorithm within its short appearance in the field of swarm intelligence optimization techniques, there has been no collective and comprehensive study on the success of the various implementations of this algorithm. As a way forward, this paper provides an overview of the research conducted on symbiotic organisms search algorithms from inception to the time of writing, in the form of details of various application scenarios with variants and hybrid implementations, and suggestions for future research directions.

AB  - Recent problems faced by industrial players commonly relates to global warming and depletion of resources. This situation highlights the importance of improvement solutions for industrial operations and environmental performances. Based on interviews and literature studies, manpower, machine, material, money and environment are known as the foundation resources to fulfil the facility's operation. The most critical and common challenge that is being faced by the industrialists is to perform continuous improvement effectively. The needs to develop a systematic framework to assist and guide the industrialist to achieve lean and green is growing rapidly. In this paper, a novel development of an adaptive analytic model for lean and green operation and processing is presented. The development of lean and green index will act as a benchmarking tool for the industrialist. This work uses the analytic hierarchy process to obtain experts opinion in determining the priority of the lean and green components and indicators. The application of backpropagation optimisation method will further enhance the lean and green model in guiding the industrialist for continuous improvement. An actual industry case study (combine heat and power plant) will be presented with the proposed lean and green model. The model is expected to enhance processing plant performance in a systematic lean and green manner.

AB  - Objective
This paper proposes a multi attribute decision support model in a supply chain in order to solve complex decision problems. The paper provides a platform to ease decision process through the integration of quality function deployment (QFD) and grey relational analysis (GRA) in demonstrating main supply chain drivers under fuzzy environment.
Methodology
The proposed method is important because of several points: First of all, in a supply chain system, evaluation factors are not really independent and must be addressed in relation to the external factors such as customer requirements. Hence, we have applied QFD tool. Second, due to the constant uncertainty in the supply chain environment, fuzziness among the factors has to be considered. So, an interval valued fuzzy model was implemented. Third, to examine the proposed decision system in reality, it was applied in Risk and Uncertain Conditions for Agriculture Production Systems (RUC-APS) project.
Contribution
An integrated version of QFD and GRA is presented. It is assumed that QFD can act to measure optimal solutions based on the distance to ideal solutions. In an interval-valued fuzzy environment the enormous volume of computation by Euclidean distance doesn't allow decision makers to obtain the results easily. This drawback is addressed using gray relational analysis. The gray relational coefficient is integrated to the fuzzy QFD to measure the distance of potential solutions from ideal solutions. This integration facilitates decision making process in further problems once big data are available.
Results
To obtain the importance degrees of logistic indicators in the supply chain, expert team considered the environmental, social & cultural, and economic factors as external dimension of the QFD. The other dimension of QFD includes supply chain drivers such as quality, environmental management system, supply chain flexibility, corporate social responsibility, transportation service condition, and financial stability. The decision model is solved and the ranking of indicators is achieved. A sensitivity analysis helps to test and check the performance of the decision model.

AB  - This paper proposes a framework for the qualitative and quantitative characterization of maintenance work to support Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) organizations in performing capacity planning and scheduling. A quantitative assessment based on 372 maintenance projects collected at a Portuguese aircraft MRO confirms that a significant part of the maintenance work is stochastic in nature, given the amount of unscheduled maintenance. The proposed framework, entitled FRamework for Aircraft Maintenance Estimation (FRAME), is intended to allow MROs in managing this uncertainty throughout the maintenance planning process and comprises for that end a set of requirements for data treatment and a method for data analysis. The established requirements address important shortcomings found in the collected data that prevented the use of maintenance data for capacity planning and scheduling as is. The developed method for data analysis, entitled 3-Dimensional Maintenance Data Analysis (3D-MDA), is based on a space-time-skill coordinate system in which indicators are calculated from historical data to comprehensively characterize the expected maintenance work. Space refers to the aircraft work zone where maintenance is performed, time refers to the project work phase when maintenance is performed, and skill refers to the type of technicians required for maintenance to be performed. The established coordinates address the limitations of reviewed techniques by allowing accurate estimations of required resources for capacity planning and an extended range of constraints for maintenance scheduling. Being generic in nature, FRAME is applicable to maintenance in other industries, or even to other activities with due adaptations.

AB  - Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) requires a critical step, namely to elicit individual preferences. On the basis of learning theories, we formalize preference construction as learning about facts and values, and as a process; we also conceptualize an online preference elicitation survey that offers learning loops to increase factual learning and support preference construction. Another originality is gamification. Game elements (a narrative and non-player characters as motivational affordance) keep respondents engaged in the demanding task of weight elicitation. Our tool enables broad public participation in MCDA, allowing reliable online preference elicitation. The survey concept was tested with 107 students and a control treatment. Quantitative and qualitative data indicate that the concept works. Participants’ factual knowledge increased. The survey helped students to learn about their own preferences concerning the importance of objectives. The practical implication is that weighting can be reliably elicited by online surveys. Participants reported a positive experience; further ways to improve it are thoroughly discussed.

AB  - The applications of nanomaterials in biomedicine have received increasing attentions. Therefore, how to choose the most suitable material among a variety of bio-nanomaterials with similar properties is a significant problem. Aiming at this problem, we describe it as a multi-criteria decision-making problem in a fuzzy covering approximation space and solve it via the TOPSIS method. Firstly, combining fuzzy neighborhood operators with fuzzy rough set models, we propose two pairs of covering-based fuzzy rough set models and study the basic properties together with classifications of these two pairs of models. Subsequently, we reveal a new method for determining objective weights using the first pair of covering-based fuzzy rough set models. Combining the objective criteria weight determination method with the TOPSIS method, we provide a solution to solve the problem of bone transplant replacement materials selection. Then, we discuss the experimental effects of our proposed method and the other eight different decision-making methods in practical problems to explain the rationality and enforceability of our approach. Finally, we validate the performance of our approach with the support of ideas of cross-validation and hypothesis testing.

Drawing on the fundamentals of the resource-based view (RBV), this study proposes a model that examines the effects of the BA adoption on business process performance (BPER) and the mediating role that BPER plays in the relationship between the adoption of BA and firm performance (FP). Based on the data collected from 204 medium- to high-level business executives in various industries, the results of this empirical study indicate that the adoption of BA positively influences BPER. There is also positive relationship between BPER and FP. Finally, the results show that BPER fully mediates the relationship between BA adoption and FP.

However, previous studies mainly focused on the improvement of road performance for tourmaline modified asphalt mixture. There were few studies on its comprehensive performance evaluation. In order to further promote the application of tourmaline in the field of modified asphalt mixtures, tourmaline modified asphalt mixture was prepared. The comprehensive performance evaluation system for tourmaline modified asphalt mixture was established based on the grey target decision method. Based on two mixing methods, the road performance of tourmaline modified asphalt mixture were systematically analyzed, the comprehensive performance of tourmaline modified asphalt mixture was evaluated, the suitable content of tourmaline in the modified asphalt mixture was determined. The results show that the comprehensive performance evaluation system based on grey target decision method has good reliability and practicability. The comprehensive performance of tourmaline modified asphalt mixture achieves its best with 10% tourmaline.

AB  - The lack of adequate consideration of the underlying factors affecting the methods of building assembly often results in inefficiencies in the uses of building materials, equipment and manpower. These inefficiencies are further compounded by the nature of the construction industry, which traditionally involves complex processes that result in wastages during production. To address this problem, this study integrates the principles of Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) and Lean Construction to develop a design assessment and optimization system to assist designers in the selection of alternative building design elements and materials in a building information model. This assessment and optimization system rely on metrics derived from production data associated with the ease of assembling, ease of handling, the speed of assembling and the wastage during assembly or construction of a building element or material. This paper presents the development of BIM-OfA assessment logic and its application for assessment and optimal selection of building envelop through the extension of Building Information Modelling (BIM). The system demonstrates its adequacy as an indicator of construction and material efficiency, its integration with BIM further enhances the practicality of using production data such weight of components, number of on-site workers and number of parts, for buildability assessment to improve efficiency and reduce waste.

The main aim of the work is to provide an updated compendium on DSSs in view of supporting researchers and engineers on the selection of the most suitable method to address their management/operation/design problems. Results showed that DSSs were mostly used as a comprehensive tool that is capable of integrating several data and a multi-criteria perspective in order to provide more reliable results. Only one energy-focused DSS was found in literature, while DSSs based on quality and operational issues are very often applied to site-specific conditions. Finally, it would be important to encourage the development of more user-friendly DSSs to increase general interest and usability.

AB  - Aim: This study investigated a decision support model for site selection to establish a new hospital based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The main purpose of this study was to select the best site for a hospital using this process in Muğla, Turkey. Method: AHP was employed as the methodological tool for the selection of the site. The study was based on 6 criteria and 19 sub-criteria. All districts in the province of Muğla were evaluated as alternatives. These districts include: Bodrum, Dalaman, Datça, Fethiye, Kavaklıdere, Koyceğiz, Marmaris, Menteşe, Milas, Seydikemer, Ula, and Yatağan. The alternatives were ranked using a 1–9 Saaty scale. The analysis of the hierarchy model was conducted by using the Super Decisions 2.2.6 software program. Results: Results show that demand is the most important factor in determining the appropriate hospital site, followed by accessibility, competitors, government, related industry and environmental conditions. According to the results, Bodrum was chosen to be the best site to establish a new hospital. Conclusion: Due to limited resources in developing countries such as Turkey, it is critical that decisions are made as a result of scientific research. In this context, investors need to take into account some factors in line with this aim. The proposed evaluation criteria provide a reference for hospital administrators and investors in the selection of hospital sites using AHP.

AB  - Emergency Department (ED) overcrowding is a public health issue associated with harmful effects simultaneously on patients and ED staff. Despite increased policies and efforts to manage this issue, it continues to rise in many EDs all over the world. ED overcrowding is not caused only by the high number of incoming patients and resources shortage, the most affecting factor leading to such problem is the inpatient boarding. In fact, the patient has to wait too long for an available hospital bed. This paper suggests a new approach to improve the inpatient flow using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods. The aim is to make a rational choice of the appropriate department in the ward to which the inpatient can be assigned even if the department related to its pathology is already crowded. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based Delphi is used to collect data. Then, the AHP method is used to determine the weights of criteria that have an impact on the assignment decision. Finally, Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE) II, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) II are applied separately to rank the possible inpatient departments in ward in decreasing order of suitability to patient’s pathology. The provided approach is tested to the ED of Habib Bourguiba University hospital of Sfax, Tunisia where the aggregation of AHP-Delphi and TOPSIS is considered.

AB  - This paper presents the rigorous study of mobile robot navigation techniques used so far. The step by step investigations of classical and reactive approaches are made here to understand the development of path planning strategies in various environmental conditions and to identify research gap. The classical approaches such as cell decomposition (CD), roadmap approach (RA), artificial potential field (APF); reactive approaches such as genetic algorithm (GA), fuzzy logic (FL), neural network (NN), firefly algorithm (FA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), artificial bee colony (ABC), cuckoo search (CS), shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) and other miscellaneous algorithms (OMA) are considered for study. The navigation over static and dynamic condition is analyzed (for single and multiple robot systems) and it has been observed that the reactive approaches are more robust and perform well in all terrain when compared to classical approaches. It is also observed that the reactive approaches are used to improve the performance of the classical approaches as a hybrid algorithm. Hence, reactive approaches are more popular and widely used for path planning of mobile robot. The paper concludes with tabular data and charts comparing the frequency of individual navigational strategies which can be used for specific application in robotics.

AB  - The paper describes a research, named GRE.ENE.LOG. (from GREen ENErgy to green LOGistic: from the port of Roccella Jonica to the Locride area), which aims to integrate the production of green-energy inside port areas and its consumption to feed Electric Vehicles (EVs) for transport and logistic services. The system is composed by: (i) a “sea-to-grid” technological component harvesting and producing electrical energy from sea waves; (ii) a “green” logistic services based on the use of EVs. This paper is relative to part (ii). One of the main challenge is to promote the use of green-energy resources for freight and people mobility planning involved in the port area. The main task concerns the location of a parking area/distribution center and the optimal design of mobility services, operated by means of EVs, connecting a port with a closer extended (sub)urban area. The mobility services by EV bikes and cars are oriented to the port users; the freight services are oriented to the extended port area. In this context, the paper presents a methodology for the definition of freight logistics and passenger transport services in order to pursue sustainability goals, and a data analysis in the pilot study of Roccella Jonica port, South of Italy.

AB  - Coal resource extensive development and utilization seriously threatens the region fragile ecological environment in Western China. Using the Yushenfu coal mining area as a study site, the ecological and geological environment (eco-geo-environment) factors affected by coal mining were analyzed. Spatiotemporal data extracted from remote sensing images was combined with survey data to establish an evaluation and prediction model. Integrated eco-geo-environmental quality was established by calculating the combined weight of each factor using the fuzzy delphi analytic hierarchy process method to develop a comprehensive multi-factor eco-geo-environment quality evaluation map. Results shows that the eco-geo-environment quality was divided in five grades of worse, bad, medium, good and better, the overall condition of the study region is moderate and it is apparent that regions with less intensive mining activities (Yushen sub coal mining area) are in better condition as compared to those regions where intensive mining is well established (Shenfu sub coal mining area). Comparisons with the classified eco-geo-environment categories revealed that different eco-geo-environment quality grades were affected different eco-geo-environment categories after a period of coal resources exploitation, but eco-geo-environment quality generally has been declining since the development and utilization of coal resources. The model provides a more scientific and accurate method to evaluate regional eco-geo-environmental quality, which is important for the coordinated development between coal mining and the fragile eco-environment.

AB  - Increased competitiveness in the manufacturing industry demands optimizing performance at each level of an enterprise. Optimizing performance in terms of indicators such as manufacturing cost requires knowledge of cost-inducing variables from product design and manufacturing, and optimization of these variables. However, the number of variables that affect manufacturing cost is very high and optimizing all variables is time intensive and computationally difficult. Thus, it is important to identify and optimize select few variables that have high potential for inducing cost. Towards that goal, a dimension reduction method combining dimensional analysis conceptual modelling framework and graph centrality theory is proposed. The proposed method integrates existing knowledge of the cost inducing variables, their interactions, and input-output relationship for different functions or behavior of a system, in the form of a causal graph. Propagation of optimization objectives in the causal graph is checked to identify contradictory influences on the variables in the graph. Following the contradiction analysis, graph centrality theory is used to rank the different regions within the graph based on their relative importance to the optimization problem and to cluster the variables into two optimization groups namely, less important variables and most important variables relative to optimizing cost. The optimization problem is formulated to fix less important variables at their highest or lowest levels based on their interaction to cost and to optimize the more important variables to minimize cost. The proposed dimension reduction method is demonstrated for an optimization problem, to minimize the production cost of the bladder and key mechanism for a high-field superconducting magnet at CERN, capable of producing a 16 Tesla magnetic field. It was found that the graph region representing the electromagnetic force and resultant stress generated during energizing of the magnet ranked highest for influence on the bladder and key manufacturing cost. An optimization of the stress and its associated variables to minimize the manufacturing cost is performed using a genetic algorithm solver in Matlab.

AB  - Globalized economic systems involve complex supply chains (SCs) where environmental and social impacts are to be managed in alignment with diverse stakeholder expectations and to mitigate sustainability-related risks. Quantitative modeling approaches for sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) have gained increasing attention. Compared to analytical models and mathematical programming, simulation methods in SSCM are underrepresented, although system dynamics (SD) modeling is suitable to simulate and examine complex and dynamic systems and to support long-term, strategic decision-making. This paper provides a review of SSCM-related SD models, systematizes SSCM from a systems thinking perspective in a conceptual framework, and proposes guidelines for SD modeling in SSCM research. A content analysis of related literature examines SD models for forward, reverse, and closed-loop SCs that include environmental or social aspects of sustainability. It is found that a majority of models deals with macroscopic levels of analysis while models for intra- and inter-organizational SCs are less prominent. SSCM-related SD models integrate environmental and social sustainability metrics, governmental pressures and incentives or customer expectations, but uncertainties and risks are seldom modeled. Inferences for future SD modeling in SSCM are derived from this review to address strengths and shortcomings of extant SD modeling approaches for SSCM. SSCM-related constructs, model validation and the need of hybrid models, which integrate different simulation, optimization, or multi-criteria decision-making models, are addressed. A framework for a systems thinking perspective on SSCM is conceptualized that may serve as a basis for future research.

AB  - The sensitivity of tunnel boring machines (TBMs) to complex rock mass parameters makes the accurate and reliable prediction of these parameters crucial for the selection of reasonable operational parameters and the reduction of construction project risks. We introduce and verify a TBM driving data–based method for predicting rock mass parameters including the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), brittleness index (BI), distance between planes of weakness (DPW), and orientation of discontinuities (α). For this purpose, an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, namely support vector regression (SVR), is improved by the stacked single-target (SST) technique and used to establish rock mass parameter prediction models. A dataset of 180 samples is established based on parameters from the 4th section of the Water Supply Project from Songhua River, with 150 randomly selected samples used for training. The constructed models are applied to the remaining 30 samples, and the mean squared percentage error (MSPE) of prediction results for UCS, BI, DPW, and α are determined as 3.0%, 4.6%, 3.0%, and 2.5%, respectively, while the respective determination coefficients (R2) are obtained as 0.83, 0.75, 0.63, and 0.63. The above results are better than the results of common SVR method, and show that the developed models can effectively simulate rock mass parameters and their sudden changes, i.e., the prediction of these parameters based on TBM driving data is both feasible and practical. Moreover, the initial models are used on the dataset, the comparison between their results and the results of proposed models verify the positive effect of the SST on SVR method.

AB  - Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) requires an accurate representation of the preferences of decision-makers, for instance in the form of a multi-attribute value function. Typically, additivity or other stringent assumptions about the preferences are made to facilitate elicitation by assuming a simple parametric form. When relaxing such assumptions, parameters cannot be elicited easily with standard methods. We present a novel approach for identifying multi-attribute value functions which can have any shape. As preference information indifference statements are used that can be elicited by trade-off questions. Instead of asking one indifference statement for each pair of attributes, we ask for multiple trade-offs at different points in the attribute space. This allows inferring parameters of complex value functions despite the simplicity of the preference statements. Parameters are estimated by taking into account preference and elicitation uncertainty with a probabilistic model. Statistical inference supports identifying the most adequate preference model out of several candidate models through quantifying the uncertainty and assessing the need for non-additivity. The approach is elaborated for determining value functions by hierarchical aggregation. We apply it to an assessment of the ecological state of rivers, which is used to support environmental management decisions in Switzerland. Preference models of four experts were quantified, confirming the feasibility of the approach and the relevance of considering non-additive functions. The method suggests a promising direction for improving the representation of preferences.

AB  - Changes in land use and land cover (LULC) are important drivers of environmental changes in the tropics. Amazônia Legal has showed some declines in deforestation rates, but NW Amazonia has become one of the most recent/new hotspots of forest loss in the Amazon basin. Regional models of change are tools that support the analysis of causes and consequences in the dynamics of land use and are critical in the construction of scenarios for planning the future of the territory and conserving Amazonian forests. The neural networks implemented in the Terrset Land Change Modeler (LCM) module were used to predict and analyze the recent (2007–2016) and future business as usual (BAU2030) and two alternative scenarios for 2030 (PAST50_2030 AND TECH_2030) of the Colombian Amazon and prognostics for intact forests of the future. We used 5 main categories (forests, pastures, secondary vegetation, fragmented forests, and others) and grouped the main transitions of categories into three submodels of change (conversion to pastures, degradation and regeneration). The simulation foresees a substantial loss of forests in the business as usual scenario of 7.92% for 2030 (−3,387,898 ha), followed by a projected increase in pastures of 2,012,087 ha (52.5%) respectively. On the contrary the alternative scenarios show more reduced loss of forest for 2030 of 1,998,299 ha (4.6%) for the PAST50_2030 scenario and a 612,989 ha (1.4%) in the TECH_2030 scenario, accompanied of an increase of only 362,966 ha of pastures in the first case and a reduction of pastures of 316,705 ha in the TECH_2030 case. The most worrying projection is the reduction of intact forest from an average size of forest fragments of 5724 ha in 2016 to 1668 ha (BAU2030), 1744 ha (PAST50_2030) and a minor reduction to 2397 ha for the TECH_2030 scenario. There is also an increased isolation and a reduction of total forest core that only in the TECH_2030 scenario is less pronounced. The protection of those intact patches is key to the future of the NW Amazonia, the reduction in the rate of conversion to pastures PAST50_2030 indicates an opportunity to have a less dramatic loss of forest intact patches but the TECH_2030 scenario is where those areas remain less affected and connectivity will be less affected. These findings signal the urgent need to find mechanisms to implement effective planning in the region in order to prevent uncontrolled expansion, slow deforestation and fragmentation rates and to ensure the integrity of the protected areas and the connectivity of such key landscapes.

AB  - The steel industry is considered as one of the mother industries that serves many large and small industries. Hence, recognizing the market situation of the steel industry both inside and outside the country is very important. Supply and demand are among the most important factors in stimulating the steel market. Usually, supply and demand have complex function. So, modeling and forecasting steel supply and demand require the use of accurate and scientific approaches. This paper presents an approach to identify the steel supply and demand functions and also to forecast the supply and demand trends. In the first step, through reviewing the historical data on the steel supply and demand in Iran, the effective and most important variables will be identified. Then, the supply and demand functions will be fitted using multiple logarithmic regression analysis. Logarithmically transforming variables in a regression model is a very common way to handle situations where a non-linear relationship exists between the independent and dependent variables. The accuracy of estimations is checked through appropriate statistical tests. The analysis is based on data of Iran steel market obtained from a 60 monthly period starting in 2010 and ending in 2014. The results showed that the estimated functions was appropriate in modeling the steel supply and demand behavior. The extrapolation analysis using 24 monthly data from 2017-2018 has also been accomplished to check the performance of the regression analysis.

AB  - In arid and semi-arid areas, groundwater resource is one of the most important water sources by the humankind. Knowledge of groundwater distribution over space, associated flow and basic exploitation measures can play a significant role in planning sustainable development, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Groundwater potential mapping (GWPM) fits in this context as the tool used to predict the spatial distribution of groundwater. In this research we tested four GIS-based models for GWPM, consisting of: i) random forest (RF); ii) weight of evidence (WoE); iii) binary logistic regression (BLR); and iv) technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) multi-criteria. The Shahroud plain located in Iran, was selected to research the water scarcity and over-exploitation of groundwater resources over the past 20 years. In this research, using Iranian Department of Water Resources Management data, and extensive field surveys, 122 groundwater well data with high potential yield of ≥11 m3 h−1 were selected for GWPM. Specifically, we generated four different models selecting 70% (n = 85) of the wells and validated the resulting GWP maps upon the complementary 30% (n = 37).A total of fifteen ground water conditioning factors to explain the groundwater well distribution over the Shahroud plain were selected. From the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), a DEM (30 m resolution) was extracted to calculate a set of morphometric properties which were combined with thematic ones such as land use/land cover (LU/LC) and Soil Type (ST). Results show that in RF (LU/LC), LR (ST), and AHP (Slope) are the most relevant contributors to groundwater occurrence. After that, using the natural break method, final maps were divided into five susceptibility classes of very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The accuracy of models was ultimately tested using prediction rate (validation data), success rate (training data) and the seed cell area index (SCAI) indicators. Results of validation show that BLR with prediction rate of 0.905 (90.5%) and success rate of 0.918 (91.8%) had higher accuracy than WoE, RF and TOPSIS models with respective prediction rates of 0.885, 0.873 and 0.870 (88.5%, 87.3%, and 87%) and success rate of 0.900, 0.889, and 0.881 (90%, 88.9%, and 88.1%). SCAI results show that all models have acceptable classification accuracy although BLR outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy. Results show that the combination of remote sensing (RS) data and geographic information system (GIS) with new approaches can be used as a powerful tool in GWPM in arid and semi-arid areas. The results of this investigation introduced a potential novel methodology that could be used by decision-makers for the sustainable management of ground water resources.

AB  - In every organization, performing accurate risk assessment along with consideration of increasing accidents is a necessary tool to prevent and reduce the fatal and non-fatal consequences of their occurrence. One of the most popular methods of risk assessment is Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, which evaluate failure modes in a system by using risk priority numbers (RPNs). These methods have been criticized for including several deficiencies such as the effect of personal ’opinions, the same importance of the factors and risk rating. The present work utilizes a hybrid approach based on support vector machine and fuzzy inference system to decrease the effect of personal's opinions in determining the factors of the severity and occurrence. Also, Logarithmic Fuzzy Preference Programming is used to determine the crisp weight of dependent factor of FMEA and revised fuzzy TOPSIS used for more accurate ranking of risks. One main feature of the proposed model is that it can be used to evaluate safety risks in all organizations. To investigate the suitability of this approach, the proposed model was presented in the Copper leaching factory, Kerman, Iran. The results showed that this model has the ability to predict severity and occurrence refers to occupational accidents which occurred in a 5-year period (2012–2017) with accuracy of 87% and 95%, respectively. Also, based on the results, it was found that the weights of severity, occurrence, and detection were 0.479, 0.335, and 0.186, respectively. Results of the ranking process showed that the risk of fall from height and stucking between the objects had the highest and the lowest priority, respectively.

AB  - This paper uses a bibliometric approach to examine the growth of and changes in the Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) field over the past three decades. Bibliographic databases such as Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus provide valuable information on academic disciplines as they contain both the articles published and the articles cited. The articles published, and the disciplinary categorization of where they are published, are indicative of the changing disciplinary balance in SDSS, while the citation links of these papers illustrate the intellectual structure of the field. The analysis shows that despite conceptual links rooted in DSS, the field of SDSS developed largely independently from DSS, with little interaction between both. This is surprising, given the growing importance of spatial applications in DSS and an overlapping interest in business analytics and big data space-time analytics. The paper argues for greater interest in SDSS developments in the DSS field, including emergency response SDSS and public participation SDSS, as two forms of SDSS which extend DSS.

AB  - Governmental and local authorities are facing many new information and communication technologies challenges. The amount of data is rapidly increasing. The data sets are published in different formats. New services are based on linking and processing differently structured data from various sources. Users expect openness of public data, fast processing, and intuitive visualisation. The article addresses the challenges and proposes a new government enterprise architecture framework. The following partial architectures are included: big and open linked data storage, processing, and publishing using cloud computing. At first, the key concepts are defined. Next, the basic architectural roles and components are specified. The components result from the decomposition of related frameworks. The main part of the article deals with the detailed proposal of the architecture framework and partial views on architecture (sub-architectures). A methodology, including a proposal of appropriate steps, solutions and responsibilities for them, is described in the next step - after the verification and validation of the new framework with respect to the attributes of quality. The new framework responds to emerging ICT trends in order to evolve government enterprise architecture continually and represent current architectural components and their relationships.

AB  - Lake eutrophication is characterized by a variety of indicators, including nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, chemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll levels, and water transparency. In this study, a multidimensional similarity cloud model (MSCM) is combined with a random weighting method to reduce the impacts of random errors in eutrophication monitoring data and the fuzziness of lake eutrophication definitions on the consistency and reliability of lake eutrophication evaluations. Measured samples are assigned to lake eutrophication levels based on the cosine of the angle between the cloud digital characteristics vectors of each sample and those of each eutrophication grade. To field test this method, the eutrophication level of Nansi Lake in Shandong Province was evaluated based on monitoring data collected in 2009–2016. Results demonstrate that, in 2009 and in 2011–2015, the upper lake of Nansi Lake exhibited moderate eutrophication while the lower lake exhibited mild eutrophication. In 2010, 2016, elevated concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus led to an increase in the eutrophication level of the lower lake, matching that of the upper lake. Based on the results of these field tests, we conclude that the MSCM presented in this study provides a more flexible and effective method for evaluating lake eutrophication data than the existing multidimensional normal cloud model.

AB  - The Philippines is usually subjected by around 21 tropical cyclonic storms per year. Whilst information and communications are widely recognized and invaluable in managing natural disaster risks, integrating ICT assets in tropical cyclone risk assessment has given little or no attention. This study generally aimed to find an optimal and spatially-explicit approach of including ICT assets, together with other equally significant risk indicators, in assessing tropical cyclone risk in the Philippines using fuzzy logic, self-organizing map (SOM), thin plate spline (TPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS). Forty (40) cyclone risk indicators/variables and two (2) benchmark variables were standardized using fuzzy logic. Random points were extracted from the fuzzified datasets and then analyzed using a neural network clustering with a 2-dimension layer of 100 neurons arranged in a 10 x 10 hexagonal grid. Examination of the SOM planes revealed three decision options: accept, eliminate, and uncertain to accept or eliminate some of the cyclone risk variables. To address this uncertainty, examination of 3D surface and 2D contour plots of thin plate spline (TPS) was further performed. The accepted 22 cyclone risk indicators were then combined using the fuzzy gamma overlay operation to generate the cyclone risk map. The output map revealed that 65% of the regions in the country are classified with high to extremely high levels of risk to tropical cyclones. The results of this study can provide valuable insights for an informed policy/decision-making to improve the country's ICT infrastructures and services for reducing its vulnerability from the impacts of the aforementioned hydro-meteorological hazard.

AB  - Assessing and managing cumulative impacts produced by interactive anthropogenic and natural drivers is a major challenge to achieve the sustainable use of marine spaces in line with the objectives of relevant EU acquis. However, the complexity of the marine environment and the uncertainty linked to future climate and socio-economic scenarios, represent major obstacles for understanding the multiplicity of impacts on the marine ecosystems and to identify appropriate management strategies to be implemented. Going beyond the traditional additive approach for cumulative impact appraisal, the Cumulative Impact Index (CI-Index) proposed in this paper applies advanced Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis techniques to spatially model relationships between interactive climate and anthropogenic pressures, the environmental exposure and vulnerability patterns and the potential cumulative impacts for the marine ecosystems at risk. The assessment was performed based on spatial data characterizing location and vulnerability of 5 relevant marine targets (e.g. seagrasses and coral beds), and the distribution of 17 human activities (e.g. trawling, maritime traffic) during a reference scenario 2000–2015. Moreover, projections for selected physical and biogeochemical parameters (temperature and chlorophyll ‘a’) for the 2035–2050 timeframe under RCP8.5 scenario, were integrated in the assessment to evaluate index variations due to changing climate conditions. The application of the CI-Index in the Adriatic Sea, showed higher cumulative impacts in the Northern part of the basin and along the Italian continental shelf, where the high concentration of human activities, the seawater temperature conditions and the presence of vulnerable benthic habitats, contribute to increase the overall impact estimate. Moreover, the CI-Index allowed understanding which are the phenomena contributing to synergic pressures creating potential pathways of environmental disturbance for marine ecosystems. Finally, the application in the Adriatic case showed how the output of the CI-Index can provide support to evaluate multi-risk scenarios and to drive sustainable maritime spatial planning and management.

By employing Geographical Information Systems and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), the recommended sustainable siting areas for solar power generation farms siting are identified, allowing the application of a spatial multi-criteria decision-making approach. The methodology identifies the available areas for solar farms siting, based on exclusion criteria defined from the current legislation. Furthermore, the available siting areas are evaluated and ranked through a multi-criteria analysis, considering also the relative importance of the selected criteria, through the AHP implementation performed by involved energy-related groups. The developed methodology employs different types of criteria, such as techno-economic and socio-environmental, it takes into account the distinct opinions of different stakeholders and it enables the evaluation of different scenarios. Finally, the methodology was applied for the case study of the Regional Unit of Rethymno, where the results, in terms of the potential maximum power that can be produced from the highest priority areas are 530 MWp for photovoltaics and 30 MW for Concentrated Solar Power systems.

AB  - Facilitating mobility is important for creating tourism demand and is legislated by the visa policies of nations. Most countries implement visa regulations aimed at homeland security which also deter genuine travellers hindering domestic economy by means of tourism, trade, science and knowledge exchange. Turkey, on the other hand, has been implementing liberal visa policies in recent decades in order to boost the number of visiting travellers and thereby support tourism. In this paper, we used a decision tree approach to decipher the hampering impact of restrictive visa regimes on tourism demand, employing the inbound tourism data from eighty-four countries to Turkey in the period of 2000–13. We discovered the predictors that have the strongest impact on tourism demand using the Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID), Exhaustive-CHAID, Classification and Regression Trees, and Random Tree algorithms, and found that visa restrictions are as prognostic via the information fusion based sensitivity analysis. We recommend policy-makers describing liberal visa policies to the greatest extent in view of immigration issues and security threats they pose in order to improve the mobility across nations

AB  - Mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) is reckoned as a lucrative tool regarding exploration programs that include lengthy and multi-branched decision pathways with variously conceivable outcomes. This paper outlines the prosperous application of a new hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method called BWM-ARAS for integrating multisource geological dataset to delineate highly Cu prospectivity areas in the Abhar area, NW Iran. In fact, the BWM-ARAS method is a compound of two distinct procedures, in which the BWM method is exploited for weighting to criteria and sub-criteria while ARAS method is responsible for ranking the varieties of alternatives. Herein, BWM-ARAS method is implemented on a set of multisource geoscience data as targeting criteria (derived from geological, geochemical, and remote sensing dataset) pertaining to the mineral deposit of type sought that are termed evidential maps. For fulfilling the integration process, the spatial values of evidential maps are initially transformed to a new space ranging [0, 1] by the logistic sigmoid function, and then discretized through C-A fractal-based model to ascertain thresholds corresponding favorable populations. In addition, a fuzzy MPM, a straightforward knowledge-based method, is accomplished to peruse the adequacy of the former method. The predication-area (P-A)plot and normalized density (Nd) as authoritative methods were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of abovementioned prospectivity models. Accordingly, the obtained results corroborated the higher authenticity of the BWM-ARAS model (Nd=7.33) compared with the fuzzy model (Nd=3.54) in delimiting the sought areas.

AB  - In the past few decades, it has been widely observed that environmental awareness is continuously increasing among people, stakeholders, and governments. However, rigorous environmental rules and policies pushed organizations to accept affirmative changes like green supply chain management practices in their processes of the supply chain. Selection of green supplier is a tedious task and comprises a lot of challenges starting from evaluation to their final selection, which is experienced by supplier management professionals. The development and implementation of practical decision-making tools that seek to address these challenges are rapidly evolving. In the present work, the evaluation of a set of suppliers is primarily based on both conventional and environmental criteria. This work proposes a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) based framework that is used to evaluate green supplier selection by using an integrated fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with the other three techniques namely MABAC (“Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison”), WASPAS (“Weighted Aggregated Sum-Product Assessment”) and TOPSIS (“Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal Solution”). Initially, six green supplier selection environmental criteria (Environmental management system, green image, staff environment training, eco-design, pollution control, and resource consumption) and three conventional criteria (price, quality and service level) have been identified through literature review and expert’s opinions to employ MCDM approach. A real-world case study of the automotive industry in India is deliberated to exhibit the proposed framework applicability. From AHP findings, ‘Environment management system’, ‘Pollution control’, ‘Quality’, and ‘Green image’ have been ranked as the topmost four green supplier selection criteria. Besides, the consistency test was performed to check the uniformity of the expert's input whereas the ‘robustness' of the approach was tested by performing sensitivity analysis. The results illustrate that the applied fuzzy hybrid methods reach common green supplier rankings. Moreover, out of the four green supplier’s alternatives, supplier number ‘one’ got the highest rank. This shows that the applied models are robust in nature. Further, this study relinquishes a single platform for the selection of green supplier under fuzzy environment. The applied methodology and its analysis will provide insight to decision-makers of supplier selection. It may aid decision-makers and the procurement department not only to differentiate the significant green supplier selection criteria but also to assess the most efficient green supplier in the supply chain in the global market.

AB  - Orifice flow meters are utilized extensively to measure the flow rate thanks to their simple design and relatively lower cost. The main drawback is the high pressure loss with respect to the other obstruction meters. The objective of the present study is to find the optimal shape of an orifice plate that reduces the pressure loss. To reach this goal, the adjoint method was used to reshape the sharp edged orifice plate. Moreover, surrogate based optimization was employed to determine the optimal parameters of interest that control the flow through orifice meter. The optimal shape of the orifice plate using the adjoint method shows 55% reduction in the pressure loss coefficient at a Reynolds number Re=1.84×104. Besides, the effect of inserting a downstream ring was investigated. Applying the adjoint method on the orifice plate with downstream ring reduces the pressure loss by 34%. Moreover, the surrogate based optimization was conducted when a ring is used downstream of the orifice plate. Design of experiment (DoE) was conducted on three parameters viz. the distance of the ring behind the orifice, the tip angle of the orifice and the tip angle of the ring. Numerical simulations were carried out to provide the artificial neural network by the necessary training data. The optimum shape reduces the pressure loss by 68%.

AB  - Flooding is one of the most significant environmental challenges and can easily cause fatal incidents and economic losses. Flood reduction is costly and time-consuming task; so it is necessary to accurately detect flood susceptible areas. This work presents an effective flood susceptibility mapping framework by involving an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with two metaheuristic methods of biogeography based optimization (BBO) and imperialistic competitive algorithm (ICA). A total of 13 flood influencing factors, including slope, altitude, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index, stream power index, sediment transport index, distance to river, landuse, normalized difference vegetation index, lithology, rainfall and soil type, were used in the proposed framework for spatial modeling and Dingnan County in China was selected for the application of the proposed methods due to data availability. There are 115 flood occurrences in the study area which were randomly separated into training (70% of the total) and verification (30%) sets. To perform the proposed framework, the step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis algorithm is first used to evaluate the correlation between influencing factors and floods. Then, two ensemble methods of ANFIS-BBO and ANFIS-ICA are constructed for spatial prediction and producing flood susceptibility maps. Finally, these resultant maps are assessed in terms of several statistical and error measures, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the ROC curve (AUC), root-mean-square error (RMSE). The experimental results demonstrated that the two ensemble methods were more effective than ANFIS in the study area. For instance, the predictive AUC values of 0.8407, 0.9045 and 0.9044 were achieved by the methods of ANFIS, ANFIS-BBO and ANFIS-ICA, respectively. Moreover, the RMSE values for ANFIS, ANFIS-BBO and ANFIS-ICA using the verification set were 0.3100, 0.2730 and 0.2700, respectively. In addition, as regards ANFIS-BBO and ANFIS-ICA, a total areas of 39.30% and 35.39% were classified as highly susceptible to flooding. Therefore, the proposed ensemble framework can be used for flood susceptibility mapping in other sites with similar geo-environmental characteristics for taking measures to manage and prevent flood damages.

AB  - Groundwater is a hidden natural resource which plays a crucial role in all the environmental and biological processes with a greater significance on socio-economic activities. However, the nature of groundwater is dynamic and highly variable from place to place. Therefore, for sustainable development and management, accurate location based groundwater potential mapping is critical in arid and semi-arid regions. This study demonstrates the proficiency of three decision making approaches, viz., influencing factors (IF), frequency ratio (FR), and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) techniques in groundwater potentiality mapping. A total eight parameters such as lithology, geomorphology, slope, drainage density, land-use, lineament density, rainfall, soil texture, and soil depth are assessed through satellite and conventional data sources. Weights are assigned to all these parameters and their sub parameters to perform influencing factor and AHP models, based on existing knowledge. Frequency ratio is performed by calculation of the ratio between the number of wells availability on a category to the total area of each factor. Three resultant maps are prepared by integrating all these parameters and their corresponding weights in GIS environment. The validation results exhibit that the map produced using FR model is more efficient (75% accuracy) compared to the IF (71% accuracy) and AHP techniques (70% accuracy). Based on this study it is concluded that the frequency ratio model is more reliable for the assessment of groundwater potential. However, the groundwater potential maps prepared in this study will be helpful for effective planning and groundwater management in Vaitarna basin.

AB  - Intuitionistic multiplicative set is a powerful technique to depict asymmetric or unbalanced evaluation information. Given that the MULTIMOORA method is a multiple criteria decision making method with strong robustness, this paper aims to propose a distance-based intuitionistic multiplicative MULTIMOORA method integrating a novel weight-determining method. To do so, firstly, new distance measures, including the intuitionistic multiplicative Jaccard distance, the intuitionistic multiplicative Dice distance, and the intuitionistic multiplicative generalized distance measure, are defined. Subsequently, an interesting weight determining method motivated by the grey relation analysis theory is presented to determine the weights of criteria. Based on these research findings, we then develop an improved intuitionistic multiplicative MULTIMOORA method to address the multiple criteria decision making problems with intuitionistic multiplicative evaluation information. A case study concerning medical equipment selection is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. The effectiveness and superiority of the distance-based intuitionistic multiplicative MULTIMOORA method are verified by some comparative analyses.

AB  - The main objective of the present study was to produce a novel ensemble data mining technique that involves an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) optimized by Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (SFLA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for spatial modeling of landslide susceptibility. Step-wise Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) was utilized for the evaluation of the relation between landslides and landslide-related factors providing ANFIS with the necessary weighting values. The developed methods were applied in Langao County, Shaanxi Province, China. Eighteen factors were selected based on the experience gained from studying landslide phenomena, the local geo-environmental conditions as well as the availability of data, namely; elevation, slope aspect, slope angle, profile curvature, plan curvature, sediment transport index, stream power index, topographic wetness index, land use, normalized difference vegetation index, rainfall, lithology, distance to faults, fault density, distance to roads, road density, distance to rivers and river density. A total of 288 landslides were identified after analyzing previous technical surveys, airborne imagery and conducting field surveys. Also, 288 non-landslide areas were identified with the usage of Google Earth imagery and the analysis of a digital elevation model. The two datasets were merged and later divided into two subsets, training and testing, based on a random selection scheme. The produced landslide susceptibility maps were evaluated by the receiving operating characteristic and the area under the success and predictive rate curves (AUC). The results showed that AUC based on the training and testing dataset was similar and equal to 0.89. However, the processing time during the training and implementation phase was considerable different. SWARA-ANFIS-PSO appeared six times faster in respect to the processing time achieved by SWARA-ANFIS-SFLA. The proposed novel approach, which combines expert knowledge, neuro-fuzzy inference systems and evolutionary algorithms, can be applied for land use planning and spatial modeling of landslide susceptibility.

AB  - Variable rate irrigation (VRI) is the capacity to spatially vary the depth of water application in a field to handle different types of soils, crops, and other conditions. Precise management zones must be developed to efficiently apply variable rate technologies. However, there is no universal method to determine management zones. Using speed control maps for the central pivot is one option. Thus, this study aims to develop an intelligent fuzzy inference system based on precision irrigation knowledge, i.e., a system that can create prescriptive maps to control the rotation speed of the central pivot. Satellite images are used in this study because remote sensing offers quick measurements and easy access to information on crops for large irrigation areas. Based on the VRI-prescribed map created using the intelligent decision-making system, the pivot can increase or decrease its speed, reaching the desired depth of application in a certain irrigation zone. Therefore, considering the spatial variability in the crop has made the strategy of speed control more realistic than traditional methods for crop management. The intelligent irrigation system pointed out areas with lower leaf development, indicating that the pivot must reduce its speed, thus increasing the water layer applied to that area. The existence of well-divided zones could be observed; each zone provides a specific value for the speed that the pivot must develop for decreasing or increasing the application of the water layer to the crop area. Three quarters of the total crop area had spatial variations during water application. The set point built by the developed system pointed out zones with a decreased speed in the order of 50%. From the viewpoint of a traditional control, the relay from pivot percent timer should have been adjusted from 70% to 35% whenever the central pivot passed over that specific area. The proposed system obtained values of 37% and 47% to adjust the pivot percent timer. Therefore, it is possible to affirm that traditional control models used for central-pivot irrigators do not support the necessary precision to meet the demands of speed control determined by the developed VRI systems. Results indicate that data from the edaphoclimatic variables when well-fitted to the fuzzy logic can solve uncertainties and non-linearities of an irrigation system and establish a control model for high-precision irrigation.

AB  - This paper present a comparison between Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) learning approaches and algorithms. FCMs are fuzzy digraphs with weights and feedback loops, consisting of nodes interconnected through directed arcs mostly used for knowledge representation and system modelling. One of the most important characteristics of FCMs is their learning capabilities. FCMs are normally constructed through experts’ opinions, thus they maybe subjective. Learning algorithms are introduced to overcome this inconvenient. One of the main problem of the new proposed algorithms is their validation. Using theoretical and experimental analysis, this research aims to (1) compare FCM learning algorithms proposed in the literature, (2) provide a validation tool for new FCM learning algorithms (3) present a new algorithm called Asexual Reproduction Optimisation (ARO) with one of its extensions – Modified ARO (MARO) – as a novel FCM learning algorithm to use the validation tool proposed. According to the findings from the literature, it seems that among FCM learning approaches, population-based algorithms perform better compared to other algorithms. Also, the testing was done in five benchmark datasets and a synthetic dataset with different node sizes using two criteria of in-sample and out-of-sample errors. The results show that MARO outperforms other algorithms in both error functions in terms accuracy and robustness.

AB  - The Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Set (HFLTS) is a powerful tool to depict experts’ cognitive complex linguistic information. This paper aims to propose a new score function of HFLTS to eliminate the defects of the subscript-based operations on HFLTSs. Hesitant degree is an intrinsic feature of HFLTS, and the greater the hesitant degree is, the lower the quality of the HFLTS will be. The asymmetric and non-uniform distributed linguistic term set is commonly used when expressing cognitive complex linguistic information. Considering both the hesitant degrees and the unbalanced linguistic terms in evaluations, a new score function of HFLTS, named the Score-HeDLiSF, is proposed based on the psychology of experts. The Score-HeDLiSF shows many advantages over the existing score function of HFLTS in terms of representing both the balanced and unbalanced linguistic information with hesitant degree and linguistic scale functions. Afterward, a hesitant degree-based weighting method is proposed to determine the weights of experts and criteria. To derive robust decision results, the MULTIMOORA method is improved by integrating the ORESTE method, and then we extend it to the unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic context based on the introduced score function of HFLTS. Finally, an investment problem regarding the shared bicycles is solved by the proposed unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA method. The advantages of the unbalanced HFL-MULTIMOORA are highlighted by comparative analyses with two well-known multi-criteria decision-making methods.

AB  - In multi-stage manufacturing environments, reworking at an early stage can prevent costly defects at later stages. One goal of the EU research project ZAero (Zero-defect manufacturing of composite parts in the aerospace industry) is to generate feature data by implementing an inline quality control for the manufacturing process of carbon fibre components of aircraft. However, for each feature detected by ZAero’s inline quality control, operators must decide whether or not to rework that feature. Additional rework of non defects can reduce expensive defects in later stages, but the increased effort should not have a significant impact on production. To help operators make the right decisions, an extensible hybrid decision support system (DSS) is proposed, which combines a software application that visualizes 3D-based process-specific feature data and supports the execution of rework decisions with web-based business analytics dashboards. The dashboards visualize data generated by part flow simulation experiments for various rework strategies, as well as data from a manufacturing execution system (MES). The proposed DSS can be easily customized to integrate additional data treasures from the ever-increasing amount of data in the industrial sector.

AB  - This paper proposes a fuzzy clustering algorithm through neutrosophic association matrix. In the first step, data are fuzzified into neutrosophic sets to create neutrosophic association matrix. By deriving a finite sequence of neutrosophic association matrices, the neutrosophic equivalence matrix is generated. Finally, the lambda-cutting is performed over the neutrosophic equivalence matrix to derive the final lambda-cutting matrix which is used to determine the clusters. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets using different clustering criteria show the advantage of the proposed clustering over the existing algorithms.

AB  - Nowadays, industrial companies are facing ever-increasing challenges to generate new value-in-use and maintain their high competitiveness in the market. With the rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), IT is embedded in the products themselves, i.e. smart, connected products (SCPs) to generate values. Hence, an emerging value proposition paradigm, smart product-service system (Smart PSS) was introduced, by leveraging both SCPs and its generated services as a solution bundle to meet individual customer needs. Unlike other types of PSS, in Smart PSS, massive user-generated data and product-sensed data are collected during the usage phase, where potential requirements can be elicited readily in a value co-creation manner with context-awareness. Nevertheless, only few scholars discuss any systematic manner to support requirement elicitation in such context. To fill the gaps, this research proposes a novel data-driven graph-based requirement elicitation framework in the Smart PSS, so as to assist engineering/designers make better design improvement or new design concept generation in a closed-loop manner. It underlines the informatics-based approach by integrating heterogeneous data sources into a holistic consideration. Moreover, by leveraging graph-based approach, context-product-service information can be linked by the edges and nodes in-between them to derive reliable requirements. To validate its feasibility and advantages, an illustrative example of smart bicycle design improvement is further adopted. As an explorative study, it is hoped that this work provides useful insights for the requirement elicitation process in today’s smart connected environment.

AB  - Electric taxi (ET), with zero exhaust emission, plays a vital role in low-carbon sustainable development of urban public traffic to reduce fossil fuel consumption and air pollution. As the key part of ET development, charging station (CS) directly impacts ET’s widespread application by figuring out the charging difficulty of ET. Therefore, to tackle the location issues of electric taxi charging station (ETCS), a novel two-stage location model is built in consideration of ET dynamic distribution and charging requirements in this paper. Firstly, taking the complex features of ET into account, such as dynamic location and dispersed distribution, the dynamic distribution clustering model of ET is formed based on k-means method, by which lots of scattered ET locations are grouped into certain clustering blocks. Secondly, according to aforementioned blocks, the location model of ETCS is established with barycentric method to get the location of ETCS, in view of both the latitude and longitude location and charging demands of each clustering block. Finally, the two-stage location model is employed in the case study of ETCS location in Chengdu, China. The result shows that the chosen location meets the charging requirements and the characteristic of taxi distribution in Chengdu, proving the validity of the model. The two-stage location model is an improved approach of traditional static barycentric method by processing ET’s dynamic distribution and decentralized charging requirements with k-means clustering algorithm, and is of theoretical and practical significance to provide quantitative ETCS location solutions to help deal with actual CS location problems in urban management.

Bio-oil is derived from AM de-oiled seed cake in a fixed bed pyrolysis reactor at 600 °C under the heating rate of 30 °C/min. To obtain data for testing and training the suggested RSM and ANN models, a direct injection, single cylinder CI engine was fuelled with proposed test fuel 80% diesel + 20% AM bio-oil + 1000 ppm TBHQ (A20D80T). The A20D80T has been assessed for the combined effects of varying compression ratio (CR = 16:1–17.5:1) and engine load (W = 25%–100%) in variable compression ratio (VCR) diesel engine through experimental investigation and ANN prediction and RSM optimization techniques. Using the experimental data for training, an ANN replica was developed according to feed forward back propagation algorithm (FFBP). Multi-layer perception (MLP) network was used for non-linear mapping between the experimental and predicted values. Engine process parameters were accurately predicted by trained ANN. The optimal values of engine performance (brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) = 0.33 kg/kWh and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) = 22.01%) and emission behaviour (carbon monoxide (CO) = 0.67%, hydro carbon (HC) = 244 ppm, carbon dioxide (CO2) = 8.33% and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) = 351 ppm) were obtained by RSM optimization. The compression ratio of 17.5:1 at peak load condition was found to be superior engine characteristics through experimental assessment and ANN, RSM models. In the predicted ANN model the mean absolute average error (MAAE) was 0.552% and optimized RSM model MAAE was 1.231%. The ANN and RSM models gave the average correlation coefficient (R) of 0.998 and average coefficient of a determination (R2) of 0.991 respectively. The experimental, ANN and RSM analysis results depict that A20D80T blend delivered the enhanced performance and better emission behaviours compared with neat diesel fuel (D).

AB  - Time-critical applications, such as early warning systems or live event broadcasting, present particular challenges. They have hard limits on Quality of Service constraints that must be maintained, despite network fluctuations and varying peaks of load. Consequently, such applications must adapt elastically on-demand, and so must be capable of reconfiguring themselves, along with the underlying cloud infrastructure, to satisfy their constraints. Software engineering tools and methodologies currently do not support such a paradigm. In this paper, we describe a framework that has been designed to meet these objectives, as part of the EU SWITCH project. SWITCH offers a flexible co-programming architecture that provides an abstraction layer and an underlying infrastructure environment, which can help to both specify and support the life cycle of time-critical cloud native applications. We describe the architecture, design and implementation of the SWITCH components and describe how such tools are applied to three time-critical real-world use cases.

AB  - Strategy literature has mainly focused on conceptual tools to support stages of the planning and structuring of the strategy within the context of a Balanced Scorecard (BSC). Recently, quantitative tools based on multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) have received more attention; however, studies still have limitations. Such is the case of Fuzzy DEMATEL, which has been proposed in the literature, but not integrated within the whole process of strategy formulation. In addition, studies have presented weaknesses by not considering, for instance, the logical structure of a strategy map. Hence, the main objective of this study is to propose the development of a method that supports the overall process of planning, structuring and validating a business unit strategy while overcoming the limitations of previous works, considering the subjectivity of decision-making in the construction of strategy maps. To fulfil these purposes, this study proposes an extension of the work of Lopez-Ospina et al. (2017) entitled “A method for designing strategy maps using DEMATEL and linear programming”, by integrating fuzzy logic and traditional, conceptual and qualitative tools to support the diagnosis and strategy design. The significant contributions of this work is that it overcomes limitations of previous methods by providing: (1) a logic structure of strategy maps; (2) integration of subjectivity within the overall formulation process of the strategy; (3) selection of the most important relationships between strategy objectives to explain efficiently, functionally, and easily the route map of a strategy; and (4) integration of traditional qualitative tools with quantitative tools, making the process robust and holistic. The proposed method was applied to an Official Banking business unit of a Colombian bank, where expert judgment for strategy formulation helps to test the effect of the methodological design.

In order to find the main causes of this disease, researchers look into the patient's lifestyle, hereditary information, etc. The goal of data mining in this context is to find patterns that make early detection of the disease and proper treatment easier. Due to the high volume of data involved in therapeutic contexts and disease diagnosis, provision of the intended treatment method become almost impossible over a short period of time. This justifies the use of pre-processing techniques and data reduction methods in such contexts. In this regard, clustering and meta-heuristic algorithms maintain important roles. In this paper, a method based on the k-means clustering algorithm is first utilized to detect and delete outliers. Then, in order to select significant and effective features, four bi-objective meta-heuristic algorithms are employed to choose the least number of significant features with the highest classification accuracy using support vector machines (SVM). In addition, the 10-fold cross validation (CV) method is used to validate the constructed model. Using real case data, it is concluded that the multi-objective firefly (MOFA) and multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm (MOICA) with a 100% classification accuracy outperform the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) with the accuracies of 98.2% and 94.6%, respectively.

AB  - Document summarization involves identifying the salient text in a document and creating a representative summary. The event-index cognitive model describes the human cognitive processes involved in generating situational models from a given text to comprehend that text. This paper proposes an adaptive, knowledge based event-index cognitive model that creates an extractive summary for a given document. The proposed cognitive model uses the hierarchical human memory model and emotion to create the extractive summary. The performance of the proposed cognitive model was compared with the existing state-of-art methods using the DUC (Document Understanding Conference) 2001 dataset and the ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) summary evaluation tool. Under ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-S and ROUGE-SU evaluations, the proposed cognitive model for document summarization achieved an improvement of 25%, 12%, 24% and 18% in mean F-measure values. The results are statistically verified as significantly better than existing state-of-art methods using one way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey-HSD test. In addition, this paper discusses the possible future research directions in document summarization based on the proposed cognitive model.

AB  - In this study a multi-objective problem considering uncertainty and flexibility of job sequence in an automated flexible job shop (AFJS) is considered using manufacturing simulation. The AFJS production system is considered as a complex problem due to automatic elements requiring planning and optimization. Several solution approaches are proposed lately in different categories of meta-heuristics, combinatorial optimization and mathematically originated methods. This paper provides the metamodel using simulation optimization approach based on multi-objective efficiency. The proposed metamodel includes different general techniques and swarm intelligent technique to reach the optimum solution of uncertain resource assignment and job sequences in an AFJS. In order to show the efficiency and productivity of the proposed approach, various experimental scenarios are considered. Results show the optimal resources assignment and optimal job sequence which cause efficiency and productivity maximization. The makespan, number of late jobs, total flow time and total weighted flow time minimization have been resulted in an automated flexible job shop too.

AB  - Credit risk assessment is considered as one of the vital topics in financial institutions. The existing credit risk evaluation methods are based on black box models or transparent models. The black box models cannot adequately reveal information hidden in the data and the credit risk evaluation remains difficult. In addition, there exist relatively few transparent models that take into consideration interpretability and comprehensibility. To address this problem, we aim to build a reliable credit risk evaluation model which generates a set of classification rules. In fact, we consider the credit risk evaluation as a search-based optimization problem where the goal is to minimize the complexity of the generated solution, to maximize the accuracy, and also to maximize weight which represents rules importance. We conducted a comparative study of four multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in terms of their performance. The obtained results confirm the efficiency of the SMOPSO Algorithm regarding generating classification rules for credit risk assessment. The proposed credit risk evaluation model revealed an attractive trade-off between accuracy and comprehensibility.

AB  - The lights out factories that the Industry 4.0 revolution brings will become widespread due to the energy savings and the considerable reduction in labor costs, and will bring a transformation in the land selection for the industrial plants. This study is based on the assumption that existing manufacturing plant sites will be moved from urban centers in the industry 4.0 process and the urban settlement will be changed by transforming the land selection criteria with the direction of new requirements. The study aims to determine the land selection criteria of manufacturing facilities in the urban-rural areas, which will be transformed within the Industry 4.0 process. New land selection criteria for lights out factory districts are important in terms of using the spatial pattern effectively. At the end of the study, the effects of the new land selection criteria on entrepreneurs, urban planners and decision makers are discussed.

AB  - Nowadays, companies have to improve their practices in the management of sustainable supply chain with increased awareness of environmental, economic and social issues globally. Selecting the optimum sustainable supplier is crucial for sustainable supply chain management, which is a challenging multi-dimensional problem. From a systematic perspective, sustainable supplier selection problem can be separated into two parts, including criteria and methods. This paper concentrates on the method selection aspects, referring to their application examples. Thus, the objectives of this paper are twofold: one is to summarize the literature on supplier selection issues from related articles, then to present an attempt to ontology-based approach to handling knowledge about sustainable supplier selection methods. To meet this aim, ontology-based model is proposed to synthetize the knowledge of analyzed methods and related papers. Finally, the proposed ontology-based model is demonstrated by an empirical example of using competency questions to confirm its correctness and effectiveness.

AB  - In recent years personality assessment utilizing computer science methods has received a lot of interest among researchers. Many teams are looking to use different approaches to measure personality traits, using technology as an alternative to self-report based questionnaires. Many interesting studies have been carried out using social behavior analysis, natural language analysis or player modeling in a computer game. However, despite being promising, the results also show that the effectiveness of these solutions has definitely an area for development. Additionally, it should be noted that the theoretical underpinnings in psychology regarding personality models, in particular, the Big Five model, are extensive. And hold the promise that a combination of such psychological theory and computer science has a lot more to offer. In this publication, we propose a method that allows to design and manufacture a personality assessment tool, using an interactive story in which the user makes choices and actions on the basis of which her/his trait standings are estimated.

AB  - Management of railroad bridges constitutes a typical decision-making problem which arises from the necessity to allocate limited financial resources to maintenance and repair work. It is a multiple criteria issue consisting in the arrangement of bridges with regards to the level of structure degradation which is decisive for the safety level of their users. So far, despite a large number of suggested calculation models, mainly of probabilistic character, no method has been noticed that would allow to rank any number of bridges taking into consideration a full variety of structure and material solutions. Therefore, in order to meet the need for a more effective model, an innovative approach has been proposed using the aggregated calculation algorithm which combines the modified Extent Analysis Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (EA FAHP) method and the Dominant Analytic Hierarchy Process (DAHP) one. It is a decision-making and calculation model which allows to reflect the actual assessment processes in a more favourable manner, as well as to take into account the diversity of solutions with respect to materials and structure of bridges. An example was given of the application of the suggested method on the selected group of railroad bridges in Poland that have been in use for over 50 years. The selected structures have more diverse structures of decks and are more prone to damage than road bridges. Due to the lack of algorithms similar to the one discussed within this paper, it was verified in a limited scope with the use of two different methods by way of comparing the accordance of bridge ranking which is of importance for making a decision concerning the performance of maintenance and repair work.

AB  - Today, most handheld devices including smartphones, tablets and notebooks are equipped with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LTE/4G radio interfaces that can allow connections to the Internet and other devices. However, given the properties changes of the radio environment and user mobility, an open question still lies in how to select the best access network interface, considering that the availability and characteristics of an access network will change in time. This paper describes a new intelligent interface selection mechanism based on analysis of contextual information obtained from the user, network environment, and device. To select the best available wireless network, the mechanism, named as CANS (Context-Aware Network Selection), allows for dynamic decision-making during the operation of a mobile device, taking into account different metrics such as price, local network capabilities, user preferences, and the mobile terminal capabilities. The evaluation of the proposed mechanism in a real environment shows that the adoption of selection strategies enables the best exploitation of the advantages on multiple access technologies, achieving a reduction in device power consumption and financial cost.

AB  - The studies on an integrated approach for the battery (cell level), battery pack (system level) and battery pack enclosure (system level) are nascent till date. The present work proposes a combined approach for studying the coupled electrochemical-mechanical performance of the battery (cell level), battery pack and enclosure (system level). In this context, five research problems are undertaken involving the design parameters for the performance evaluation of batteries. The first issue undertaken is battery performance under stress conditions and for that varying initial stress and real-time stresses were applied, and variation in the capacity of the battery packs was studied. Initial stress was found to be in negative relation with the battery capacity. For understanding the mechanical damage (leakage, deformation, etc.), characterization of the battery cell under impact loading was done by subjecting battery cells to different impact loads and impact analysis was done using six statistical features extracted from the impact force processed signal of each test, namely: peak value, mean value, variance, skewness, kurtosis and pulse width. The third issue regards the manufacturing defects in the cell, which can potentially lead to inconsistency of cells performance in a pack and thus lower its total cycle life. Support vector classification clustering methods were applied to form a battery pack with similar performing cells and performance of the pack was compared with industrial packs in which earlier one was found to be better. The fourth research challenge involved the mechanical performance parameters such as strength, deformation, and natural frequency, which, in addition to temperature, are also critical to battery pack safety in the event of impact and vibrations under driving conditions. ANSIS and NSGA-II based approaches were used to optimize the battery design and resultant device shown maximum deformation reduced by 22.2%, the value of minimum inherent frequency improved by 3.2% and the value of mass decreased by 11.6%. The fifth research problem highlighted how, due to the enormous production of electric vehicles, by 2020, there will be 250,000 tons of batteries that need to be recycled. A combined experimental-numerical framework has been thereby suggested to mitigate it. The study resulted in the formation of an online monitoring system and safety design of batteries at both cell and system level (pack and enclosure).

AB  - The current paradigm of toxicity testing is set within a framework of Mode-of-Action (MoA)/Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) investigations, where novel methodologies alternative to animal testing play a crucial role, and allow to consider causal links between molecular initiating events (MIEs), further key events and an adverse outcome. In silico (computational) models are developed to support toxicity assessment within the MoA/AOP framework. This paper focuses on the evaluation of potential binding to the Liver X Receptor (LXR), as this has been identified among the MIEs leading to liver steatosis within an AOP framework addressing repeated dose and target-organ toxicity. The objective of this study was the development of a priority setting strategy, by means of in silico approaches and chemometric tools, to allow for the screening and ranking of chemicals according to their toxicity potential. As a case study, the present paper outlines the methodologies and procedures that have been developed in the context of the COSMOS/cosmetics safety assessment project [4], which developed computational methods in view of supporting cosmetics safety assessment, to rank chemicals based on their potential binding to LXR. Chemicals are ranked based on molecular and QSAR modelling outcomes. The contribution in this paper is threefold: the QSAR model for LXR dataset, an application of molecular modelling approaches, which have been developed and optimized for drug discovery, in the context of toxicology, and finally ranking chemicals based on diverse modelling outcomes. The novelty in this paper consists of the employment of linear (logistic regression) and non-linear (Random Forest) models in the context of ranking chemicals. The results show that these methods can be successfully applied for prioritization of compounds of major concern for potential liver toxicity, and that they perform better than the ranking methods reported in the literature to date (such as total ordering or data fusion).

Our contribution also contains an algorithmic approach for extracting the parameters of this model during an elicitation process, which is validated across a wide range of generated datasets.

AB  - Civil society increasingly holds focal companies accountable for ensuring socially and environmentally sustainable production standards among their supply base. These standards entail increased levels of complexity to be addressed by appropriately designed tools, such as the Voting Analytic Hierarchy Process (VAHP) proposed by Liu and Hai (2005). This method of multi-criteria group decision making structures decision criteria in a hierarchical fashion as per Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) for deriving criteria weights from the ordinal preferences of the group members. Compared to AHP, the method permits a simpler application in a group decision context. However, its theoretical underpinnings have been questioned in the literature. This specifically concerns (i) the requirement of a strong convex order for the importance weights of ordinal rank gradations, and (ii) the choice of discrimination threshold for consecutive rank weights in the underlying DEA model. We propose a revised VAHP method that overcomes both issues (i) and (ii) by pursuing a game-theoretic approach to elicitation of criteria weights — so as to remove subjectivity from rank discrimination. We illustrate the application of the method on a real-world problem of sustainable supplier selection. We contribute to theory by proposing a more robust VAHP tool that helps supply chain and purchasing managers selecting suppliers based on a comprehensive set of criteria spanning all three sustainability dimensions (economic, environmental, and social), while coping with parsimonious input by group decision-makers.

AB  - This research presents a novel, state-of-the-art methodology for solving a multi-criteria supplier selection problem considering risk and sustainability. It combines multi-objective optimization with the analytic network process to take into account sustainability requirements of a supplier portfolio configuration. To integrate ‘risk’ into the supplier selection problem, we develop a multi-objective optimization model based on the investment portfolio theory introduced by Markowitz. The proposed model is a non-standard portfolio selection problem with four objectives: (1) minimizing the purchasing costs, (2) selecting the supplier portfolio with the highest logistics service, (3) minimizing the supply risk, and (4) ordering as much as possible from those suppliers with outstanding sustainability performance. The optimization model, which has three linear and one quadratic objective function, is solved by an algorithm that analytically computes a set of efficient solutions and provides graphical decision support through a visualization of the complete and exactly-computed Pareto front (a posteriori approach). The possibility of computing all Pareto-optimal supplier portfolios is beneficial for decision makers as they can compare all optimal solutions at once, identify the trade-offs between the criteria, and study how the different objectives of supplier portfolio configuration may be balanced to finally choose the composition that satisfies the purchasing company's strategy best. The approach has been applied to a real-world supplier portfolio configuration case to demonstrate its applicability and to analyze how the consideration of sustainability requirements may affect the traditional supplier selection and purchasing goals in a real-life setting.

AB  - This study represents the first attempt to operationalize a novel methodological approach that couples the expanded business model canvas (BMC) with an analytical evaluation of business model items and incorporates context-intervention-mechanism-outcome logic (CIMO-logic). We applied the designed methodology to analyse ten forest-related business models in eight European countries. This study aims to enhance the understanding of the challenges and opportunities generated by changing forest ownership due to the use of new business models. The adopted procedures both enhance the understanding of existing business models and the associated mechanisms and suggest improvements for existing business models. In other words, these procedures facilitated the understanding of business model dynamics. The changing operational environment forces the traditional forestry industry to adapt, and the analysed European cases indicate that business system innovations should always be considered to meet consumers' needs. The analysed business models are mostly grounded on traditional forestry and mainly include either new services or organizational improvements. The analysed business models introduce new organizational channels for reaching customers, satisfying new customer needs, targeting unique customers, reducing transaction costs, and improving customer relationships.

AB  - Waste management requires a new vision and drastic improvements for a transition to a zero-waste circular economy. In reality, however, many economies are producing more and more waste, which poses a serious challenge to environmental sustainability. The problem is enormously complex as it involves a variety of stakeholders, demands behavioral changes, and requires a complete rethinking of the current waste management systems and the dominant linear economic model. Smart enabling technologies can aid in a transformation of waste management toward a circular economy, but many barriers persist. This study first shortlists twelve important barriers to smart waste management in China based on interviews with experienced practitioners. It then prioritizes these barriers through a scientific prioritization technique, fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), based on the survey data from three representative stakeholders. It identified three key causal barriers: the lack of regulatory pressures, the lack of environmental education and culture of environmental protection, and the lack of market pressures and demands. Practical and theoretical implications were discussed based on the research results and findings.

AB  - Laminated composite plates are extensively used in various industries due to their high stiffness-to-weight ratio and directional properties that allow optimization of the stiffness characteristics for specific applications. In multi-objective optimization problems, optimal designs for individual performance metrics may be conflicting, necessitating knowledge on the design requirements for different metrics and potential trade-offs. In this paper, a multi-objective design methodology for laminated composite plates with dynamic and load-carrying requirements is presented. Lamination parameters are used to characterize laminate stiffness matrices in a compact form resulting in a convex design space. Single and multi-objective optimization studies are carried out to determine the optimal stiffness properties. For improving the dynamic performance, maximization of the fundamental frequency metric is aimed. For enhancing the load-carrying capability, buckling load and equivalent stiffness metrics are maximized. Conforming and conflicting behavior of multiple objective functions for different plate geometries, boundary conditions and load cases are presented by determining Pareto-optimal solutions. The results provide a valuable insight for multi-objective optimization of laminated composite plates and show that presented methodology can be used in the design of such structures for improving the dynamic and load-carrying performance.

AB  - The comprehensive optimization of building energy design is fundamental to promote sustainability but it is an arduous issue that involves a huge domain of variables and objectives. The proposed investigation addresses this issue through a novel comprehensive framework – Harlequin – that performs a multi-phase and multi-objective design optimization. Three phases are carried out to optimize design variables related to the whole building-plants system, considering different energy, comfort, economic and environmental performance indicators. Phase 1 implements a genetic algorithm to achieve the Pareto optimization of envelope, geometry and space conditioning set points. Phase 2 performs a smart exhaustive sampling of design scenarios to find optimal energy systems. Phase 3 provides the most sustainable, the cost-optimal and the lowest investment (but energy-efficient) design solutions. Among these, the stakeholders can choose the best solution according to their wills and needs. Harlequin uses EnergyPlus (only in phase 1) and MATLAB® and it is so-called because building geometry and envelope are optimized for each exposure, thereby providing “Harlequin buildings”. The novelty and scientific significance consist in ensuring a reliable design optimization by investigating a domain of variables and objectives, as comprehensive as never before. As a case study, Harlequin is applied to design a typical Italian office in Milan. Compared to a reference design, significant reductions of primary energy consumption (PEC), global cost (GC) and CO2-eq emissions can be achieved, depending on the chosen solution. The maximum reductions are 43.9 kWhp/m2 a for PEC, 63.9 €/m2 for GC (discount rate of 3%) and 12.3 kg/m2 a for CO2-eq.

AB  - Recently, a growing concern with sustainability has become a consideration in business operations. However, there is a lack of mathematical models that quantify environmental effects and, in particular, social impacts of supply chains because of the inherently subjective nature of these aspects. To fill this gap, this paper models a distribution network in which the triple bottom lines of sustainability are captured. Different impacts of the network on the stakeholders, including company owners, workers, consumers and society, are considered as whole. In the current model, a multi-product vehicle routing problem with time windows (MPVRPTW) as an operational decision is integrated with strategic decisions related to the network design. To solve this model, three hybrid swarm intelligence techniques (particle swarm optimization (PSO), electromagnetism mechanism algorithm (EMA), and artificial bee colony (ABC)) are proposed, and each is hybridized with variable neighborhood search (VNS) are proposed. Because metaheuristic methods are sensitive to input parameters, response surface methodology (RSM) with the multi-objective decision making (MODM) approach is applied for tuning the parameters. The proposed approaches are compared with the hybrid of genetic algorithm (GA) and VNS as the benchmark algorithm. A fair comparison is conducted by employing six metrics to evaluate the quality of the Pareto frontier obtained by the algorithms on the test problems. According to the results, the predominance of EMA is enhanced by VNS local search.

AB  - Cloud computing is truly transforming the way e-commerce firms do business. While there has been a sharp increase in the use of cloud computing in e-commerce, the benefits of cloud service models have yet to be explored, particularly for small-to-medium-sized businesses. A strong e-commerce offering depends on a reliable and secure online store, therefore it is important for decision makers to adopt the optimal cloud computing service model such as software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), or infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), which is a multi-criteria decision-making problem (MCDM). To address this MCDM problem, we propose a novel 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic multi-criteria group decision-making method based on the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and rely upon a technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to determine a set of appropriate criteria. The proposed methodology is applied to a small-to-medium-sized company to facilitate assessing the factors associated with cloud-based e-commerce and making the decision. The result analysis indicates that SaaS is the best choice for small and medium-sized e-commerce businesses considering criteria such as complexity, reliability, security and privacy, organization readiness and firm size, while the selection of PaaS or IaaS can be reinforced considering their compatibility and scalability.

AB  - The complexity in the design of sustainable microgrids based on renewable energy sources have increased recently due to the involvement of multiple performance indices, scenarios, and stakeholders. At disintegrated level such as rural villages in developing nations, the issue has become more severe concerning the involvement of social and cultural characteristics making the problem multidimensional with multiple objectives. Thus, a proper method which can simultaneously consider the various criteria and differing views of the multiple actors involved in varying scenarios is required. In this paper, a bi-level framework based on the integration of decision making and optimization tool for the design of a rural microgrid with a perspective of sustainable development considering the annual load growth is presented. The first design level utilizes the decision analysis models to determine the best possible energy alternatives for the microgrid design considering the number of key performance indices formulating different scenarios and acts as input to the second level of the framework. A multi-objective computational optimization tool is utilized in the second level to carry out the feasibility analysis of best energy alternative in order to obtain an optimal size with a lower cost accounting yearly load growth. The proposed framework is then implemented to design a sustainable microgrid for an unelectrified village in the hilly region. Most importantly the microgrid design based on the proposed methodology for the target site utilizes the available local resources such as solar, hydro with the dam, hydrokinetics based on river water streams, etc. as the primary energy generating sources with a diesel generator as back up along with battery and pump-hydro storage as storage systems. A total of 23 alternatives depending upon the different combination of energy sources and storage is constituted in a centralized off-grid system. Moreover, four primary performance criteria (social, technical, economic and environment) with 20 sub-criteria in 29 different scenarios are considered for evaluating the microgrid which is highly unlikely to be observed in literature so far. A discursive result illustrating the various profiles (generation and storage system) of the microgrid based on daily, monthly and yearly basis accounting the load growth is also presented.

AB  - Maintenance in organizations plays an important role in the preservation and improvement of equipment, product quality, safety requirements, and cost reduction. There are many methods to plan and decide over a maintenance activity, among which multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is the well-known one. However, in many organizations, especially where limited information is available on the failure of components and equipment, it is difficult to apply quantitative models. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of maintenance and the presence of predictable and unpredictable factors that affect the reliability of equipment further complicate the process of planning. Considering the above factors, we present a novel model for preventive maintenance planning. This method employs fuzzy numbers to express reliability and take into account the associated risks and errors to analyze effective factors. This method, named as D-FAD method, is a combination of fuzzy axiomatic design and D numbers. A real case study of a part in a steel plant is presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model in different risk scenarios. The results showed that considering the risk of reliability increases the chance of other part replacement intervals to be selected. This gives decision-makers confidence and flexibility to deal with the risk of unseen events. Further, considering an interval lying between riskless and risky scenarios leads to a robust solution.

AB  - Determining economically viable and highly efficient strategic locations for utility-scale solar power plants is a costly procedure that depends on several factors. This paper investigates the spatial suitability for installations of ground-mounted solar farms based on legal, social, technical, economic, environmental and cultural perspectives through the use of Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis combined with Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique. A set of six exclusion criteria are identified and removed from the map layer considered exploitable for construction. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is then used to determine the weights of nine selected evaluation criteria found to influence the placements of the farms. Proximity raster layers were derived from features including road network and high transmission lines, overlain with a 10 m × 10 m raster terrain layers which includes elevation, slope and aspect and finally combined with interpolated raster dataset of climatological parameters comprising of global solar radiation, sunshine duration, air temperature and relative humidity. This combinatorial process through the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) technique generated a high resolution solar resource potential atlas classifying regions on the island from high to low potential for solar farm placement. Further analysis of highly suitable sites with aerial images of the localities of interest resulted in the identification of 3 best sites all situated in the northern plains of the island. The approach demonstrated is expected to help reduce time, money and resources presently allocated towards identifying and assessing hot spots for the construction of solar power plants in Mauritius.

AB  - Over the last twenty-five years, there has been a growing interest in the disassembly line balancing. The key role in reverse supply chains is the most important motivation behind this interest. Cleaner production can be possible via reverse supply chains. The objective of this study is to analyze disassembly line balancing articles in an extended way. In order to achieve this, traditional literature review is combined with bibliometric and social network analysis. This methodology gives the opportunity to identify trends, evolutionary trajectories and key issues in a more scientific and objective way. Future Study Realization Analysis (FSRA) is also proposed in this review as a new analysis tool. It can be able to see all suggestions for future studies in all studies and whether they were studied or not. It is found that disassembly line balancing is immature and there need to write articles to enlarge the problem. It can be seen from bibliometric analysis that there is a rapid development in the last five years. Social network analysis results show that Surendra Gupta is the most authoritative researcher in the network. The noteworthy result of the FSRA is that the future directions of the first article on DLBP are still waiting to study. Findings of this review can be useful for future research in disassembly line balancing.

AB  - In a decision-making process, a decision maker is often able to express his/her preferences of importance of the evaluative criteria only linguistically. These linguistic terms can be expressed as triangular fuzzy numbers. To make a decision about the set of alternatives that are evaluated by differently important criteria, a method of decision-making theory can be applied. Many theories do not accept criteria importance in the format of fuzzy numbers, which means that fuzzy numbers must be transformed into criteria weights. For this purpose, not many methods are known. Based on a literature review, Lai and Hwang's optimization approach is selected because this method has least number of shortcomings. Therefore, this method is researched in more detail. The specified problems with the optimization model are eliminated by the proposed improvements and a new comprehensive fuzzy weights estimation method is introduced. Some proposals are explained through illustrative examples. Easy applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated on a real case of making a portfolio of open unit trusts.

AB  - This study proposes a new group decision making (GDM) methodology to solve outranking problems efficiently under uncertainty integrating multi criteria decision making (MCDM) and intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) theory. To this aim, ELECTRE I, an outranking based MCDM approach is extended with VIKOR method, an ideal solution based approach, under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. The methodology utilizes pairwise comparison and outranking relation concepts of ELECTRE methods to construct different concordance and discordance sets in order to reflect preferences of decision makers effectively. By the help of similarities between concordance and discordance characteristics of ELECTRE and maximum group utility and minimum individual regret characteristics of VIKOR, the methodology enables the intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTRE to overcome its weakness in ranking process and presents complete ranking. In addition, this study employs entropy method to identify the weights of criteria and decision makers, and weighted distance approach to determine the weights of different concordance sets. Utilizing these methods leads to specifying these weights objectively. The applicability of the proposed approach is explored by an illustrative example on supplier selection problem by explaining the method step by step. Furthermore, four computational experiments are conducted in order to demonstrate its applicability to the other areas and the results are compared.

AB  - In the semiconductor wafer fabrication process, wafers go through a series of sequential process steps. Typically, each process step has several machines, and the wafers are assigned to one whenever they enter the process step. When assigning wafers to machines, it is important to consider both the quality and productivity perspectives. Major semiconductor companies in Korea have recently implemented a wafer assignment system to improve wafer yield, a critical measure for semiconductor quality. This system, however, does not consider the productivity perspective. This paper presents a systematic method for assigning wafers to maximize the wafer yield while satisfying a predetermined target level of productivity. A simple hypothetical example is presented to illustrate the method.

AB  - Turkey has a great potential in terms of renewable energy sources. Particularly, this potential comes to the fore in solar energy. Compared to the rest of Europe and other countries worldwide, Turkey has a very large level of annual sunshine period. One of the main elements used to produce electricity from solar energy in solar farms is solar cells. They produce direct current by converting the solar radiation directly onto the solar energy. In order to increase the power output, several solar cells are connected to each other in parallel or in series and mounted on a surface. This structure is called the solar cell module or photovoltaic module. If necessary, these modules can be connected to each other in series or parallel, to create a series of photovoltaic. For high efficiency photovoltaic cycle, it is necessary to improve the structural and electrical properties of the material to optimize the forbidden energy range and to use the most appropriate combination in the choice of the heterocline. In addition, the fact that the selected material can be produced economically at large scale is one of the conditions and it is desired that the sensitivity to the environment is considered during the use of this material. There are many types of solar cells in the market. Recently, 3rd generation solar cells from different materials have taken their place in the market. In a photovoltaic cell, the key operating parameters are efficiency, area, fill factor, and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. This study’s aim is determining the photovoltaic performance and comparing the solar cells fabricated in different types according to key operating parameters.

AB  - To tackle the increasing global energy demand the climate change problem, the integration of renewable energy and negative emission technologies is a promising solution. In this work, a novel concept called “negative emission hybrid renewable energy system” is proposed for the first time. It is a hybrid solar-wind-biomass renewable energy system with biochar production, which could potentially provide energy generation, carbon sequestration, and waste treatment services within one system. The optimization and the conflicting economic and environmental trade-off of such system has not yet been fully investigated in the literature. To fill the research gap, this paper aims to propose a stochastic multi-objective decision-support framework to identify optimal design of the energy mix and discuss the economic and environmental feasibilities of a negative emission hybrid renewable energy system. This approach maximizes energy output and minimizes greenhouse gas emissions by the optimal sizing of the solar, wind, combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, and energy storage components in the system. A case study on Carabao Island in the Philippines, which is representative of an island-mode energy system, is conducted based on the aim of achieving net-zero emission for the whole island. For the island with a population of 10,881 people and an area of 22.05 km2, the proposed optimal system have significant negative emission capability and promising profitability with a carbon sequestration potential of 2795 kg CO2-eq/day and a predicted daily profit of 455 US$/day.

AB  - Flood vulnerability is increasing in Vietnam due to rapid population growth, urbanization, and industrial development. Although there has been a significant increase in studies on flood risk assessments at the local scales in Vietnam, there remains a lack of tools developed for use at the national scale. In response to this need, we sourced and analyzed flood damage data from 1989 to 2015 in Vietnam's national disaster database in order to assess the flood risk of Vietnam's regions and provinces. The study proposes a new approach, multiple linear regression-TOPSIS, to analyze the disaster data. Our findings show that the North Central Coast is the most vulnerable region, followed by the Mekong Delta. Nghe An province has the highest flood risk score while Ho Chi Minh city has the lowest flood risk. This assessment tool provides accessible risk information for decision-makers and planners to classify the most at-risk areas and has practical implications for flood risk management at the national and local scales. The study also provides a new method for analyzing Vietnam's national disaster database, which may suggest potential applications for disaster loss databases in other countries and regions.

AB  - Citizen Science, traditionally known as the engagement of amateur participants in research, is showing great potential for large-scale processing of data. In areas such as astronomy, biology, or geo-sciences, where emerging technologies generate huge volumes of data, Citizen Science projects enable image classification at a rate not possible to accomplish by experts alone. However, this approach entails the spread of biases and uncertainty in the results, since participants involved are typically non-experts in the problem and hold variable skills. Consequently, the research community tends not to trust Citizen Science outcomes, claiming a generalised lack of accuracy and validation. We introduce a novel multi-stage approach to handle uncertainty within data labelled by amateurs in Citizen Science projects. Firstly, our method proposes a set of transformations that leverage the uncertainty in amateur classifications. Then, a hybridisation strategy provides the best aggregation of the transformed data for improving the quality and confidence in the results. As a case study, we consider the Galaxy Zoo, a project pursuing the labelling of galaxy images. A limited set of expert classifications allow us to validate the experiments, confirming that our approach is able to greatly boost accuracy and classify more images with respect to the state-of-art.

AB  - Relational Association Rules (RARs) capture generic relations between attributes values in possibly large data sets. Due to their ability to uncover underlying semantically relevant patterns, they are of particular interest in data mining research and applicable in both unsupervised and supervised learning scenarios. With the aim of increasing the stability and expressiveness of the classical, non-gradual RARs, Gradual Relational Association Rules (GRARs) have been introduced. By generalizing the boolean relations to gradual relations, GRARs also capture the degrees to which generic relations are satisfied. In the current paper we introduce a new approach called DynGRAR (Dynamic Gradual Relational Association Rules Miner) for uncovering interesting GRARs in dynamic data sets which are incrementally extended with both new data instances and new data attributes. DynGRAR dynamically adjusts the set of all interesting GRARs. Through multiple experiments performed on publicly available software defect prediction data sets, we have evaluated DynGRAR versus applying the standard GRARs mining algorithm from scratch on the extended data. The results obtained emphasize the superior performance of the dynamic approach we propose.

AB  - Sintering is a raw material preparation process of blast furnace ironmaking. However, its high energy consumption and pollutant discharge have seriously impeded the development of iron and steel enterprises. In order to reduce the energy consumption and production cost while improving the sinter output and quality, a novel blending optimization model was established based on the in-depth analysis of blending principle in this study. According to the complementary principle of the basic properties between iron ores, the blending model takes the minimum blending cost as optimization objective, and searches the blending scheme group that meets the requirements of granulation and mineralization performance. Then the yield and quality indices and fuel consumption were predicted, and the optimized blending scheme that meets the user's demand is selected via multi-index comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results show that the blending cost of optimized schemes reduced by 0.19–4.19% and fuel consumption decreased by 1.16–3.79 kg per ton sinter, with the improvement of sinter yield and quality indices. The emission of CO2 can be reduced by 15,700–51,200 tons for an enterprise with annual output of 5 million tons of sinter.

AB  - Floodplains perform several important ecosystem services, including storing water during precipitation events and reducing peak flows, thus reducing flooding of downstream communities. Understanding the relationship between flood inundation and floodplains is critical for ecosystem and community health and well-being, as well as targeting floodplain and riparian restoration. Many communities in the United States, particularly those in rural areas, lack inundation maps due to the high cost of flood modeling. Only 60% of the conterminous United States has Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) through the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). We developed a 30-meter resolution flood inundation map of the conterminous United States (CONUS) using random forest classification to fill the gaps in the FIRM. Input datasets included digital elevation model (DEM)-derived variables, flood-related soil characteristics, and land cover. The existing FIRM 100-year floodplains, called the Special Flood Hazard Area (SHFA), were used to train and test the random forests for fluvial and coastal flooding. Models were developed for each hydrologic unit code level four (HUC-4) watershed and each 30-meter pixel in the CONUS was classified as floodplain or non-floodplain. The most important variables were DEM-derivatives and flood-based soil characteristics. Models captured 79% of the SFHA in the CONUS. The overall F1 score, which balances precision and recall, was 0.78. Performance varied geographically, exceeding the CONUS scores in temperate and coastal watersheds but were less robust in the arid southwest. The models also consistently identified headwater floodplains not present in the SFHA, lowering performance measures but providing critical information missing in many low-order stream systems. The performance of the random forest models demonstrates the method's ability to successfully fill in the remaining unmapped floodplains in the CONUS, while using only publicly available data and open source software.

AB  - Present work aims to investigate the thermal performance assessment of different combinations of working fluids for an Organic Rankine Cycle powered Vapor Compression Cycle (ORC-VCC) for air-conditioning applications. Analysis of system performance is conducted for a fixed cooling load of a small conditioned space having a sensible heat factor of 0.7, at different ambient conditions. A preliminary evaluation of the system at the baseline conditions was conducted considering the second law efficiency, overall heat capacity of exchangers, overall internal exergy destruction, and overall Coefficient of Performance. Afterwards, parametric study was performed for the best performing candidates from the preliminary analysis using second law efficiency and overall heat capacity of heat exchangers. The system parameters considered for the study include saturated temperatures of heat exchangers, ORC boiler superheat, pinch points and the sub-cooling of both the ORC and VCC condensers. Then, multi objective optimization was performed using Genetic Algorithm followed by multi-criteria decision-making using Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to select the best optimal solutions from the Pareto front. Sixteen combinations comprising of four working fluids, R245fa, R600, R600a, and R134a were analyzed. The optimization results showed R245fa ORC-R600a VCC to be the best candidate at ambient conditions of 30 °C, while at 35 °C and 40 °C, R600a ORC-R245fa VCC was found to be the most suitable candidate.

AB  - Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) plays an important role in increasing productivity and efficiency in heterogeneous wireless networks. However, different domains such as industrial wireless scenarios, small cell domains and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) require an efficient machine learning/intelligent algorithm to process the vertical handover decision that can maintain mobile terminals (MTs) in the preferable networks for a sufficient duration of time. The preferred quality of service parameters can be differentiated from all the other MTs. Hence, in this paper, the problem with the vertical handoff (VHO) decision is articulated as the process of the Markov decision aimed to maximize the anticipated total rewards as well as to minimize the handoffs’ average count. A rewards function is designed to evaluate the QoS at the point of when the connections take place, as that is where the policy decision for a stationary deterministic handoff can be established. The proposed hybrid model merges the biogeography-based optimization (BBO) with the Markov decision process (MDP). The MDP is utilized to establish the radio access technology (RAT) selection’s probability that behaves as an input to the BBO process. Therefore, the BBO determines the best RAT using the described multi-point algorithm in the heterogeneous network. The numerical findings display the superiority of this paper’s proposed schemes in comparison with other available algorithms. The findings shown that the MDP-BBO algorithm is able to outperform other algorithms in terms of number of handoffs, bandwidth availability, and decision delays. Our algorithm displayed better expected total rewards as well as a reduced average account of handoffs compared to current approaches. Simulation results obtained from Monte-Carlo experiments prove validity of the proposed model.

AB  - A multi-criteria decision-making approach was used for the selection of GCMs for Nigeria based on their ability to replicate historical rainfall estimated using three entropy-based feature selection methods namely, Entropy Gain (EG), Gain Ratio (GR), and Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU). Performances of four bias correction methods were compared to identify the most suitable method for downscaling and projection of rainfall using the selected GCMs. Random forest (RF) regression was used for the generation of the multi-model ensemble (MME) average of projected rainfall. The ensemble projections for each of the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 were computed and compared with global precipitation climatology centre (GPCC) historical rainfall of Nigeria to assess the percentage changes in annual rainfall with 95% level of confidence at different ecological zones for three future periods 2010–2039, 2040–2069, and 2070–2099. Quantile regression was used to assess the changes in seasonal rainfall at 95% confidence interval over the present century. The results revealed that MRI-CGCM3, HadGEM2-ES, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 and CESM1-CAM5 are the most suitable GCMs for the projection of rainfall in Nigeria. The linear scaling method was found as the most suitable approach for downscaling of rainfall in terms of all the statistical indices used. It was found to downscale rainfall with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) in the range of 30.7–44.0%, while Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) was between 0.81 and 0.91, and modified coefficient of agreement (md) was between 0.82 and 0.88. Projection of rainfall showed no significant change in Nigeria over the century under RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 6.5, while RCP 8.5 showed a decrease in the last part of the century (2070–2099). The seasonal changes in rainfall showed an increase in rainfall in the range of 0–20% in most parts of the north. The methodology in this study can reduce the uncertainty inherent in climate change projection and produce better projection of possible spatial and temporal changes in annual and seasonal rainfall.
