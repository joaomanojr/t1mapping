KW  - Literature review
AB  - Bearing in mind that making decisions in the aviation industry is usually related to the huge investment, it is evident that a small saving of a few percent is not negligible. Decisions usually need to be made while considering different, very often opposing criteria that could be both quantitative and qualitative. Therefore, decision makers need to apply multi-criteria decision making methods which will help them in the decision making process. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify and classify the problems in the aviation industry that are solved by using multi-criteria decision making. In this research, 166 papers published in the period from 2000 to 2018 are reviewed. The papers are divided according to the application area in four groups: airlines, airports, air traffic management, and others. Each group refers to specific stakeholder in aviation, and it is further divided by selected theme dealt with in papers reviewed, into evaluation, selection, ranking, improving and other. Moreover, the application areas have been systematically analysed and the results are presented in the paper. Finally, the results of this research indicate that: a) multi-criteria decision making methods are mostly used in airlines; b) evaluation is the most commonly present theme; c) fuzziness is incorporated in 50% of papers; d) Analytic Hierarchy Process (including fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process) is applied in approximately 40% of reviewed papers; e) Taiwan ranks first as both authors’ affiliation country and presented case studies country.

AB  - Predictive maintenance is of importance to various industries. Fleet management can be beneficial if the time-between-failures (TBF) of an automobile can be predicted. Conventionally, the prediction models in predictive maintenance are established using historical maintenance data or sensor data. In the era of big data, the availability of data has been significantly increased. This study aims to introduce geographic information systems data into TBF modelling and research their impact on automobile TBF using deep learning. An experimental study based on real-world maintenance data reveals that the performance of deep neural network improved with the help of GIS data.

AB  - This study develops a machine learning method that hybridizes the Least Squares Support Vector Classification (LSSVC) and Bat Algorithm (BA), named as BA-LSSVC, for spatial prediction of shallow landslide. To construct and verify the hybrid method, a Geographic Information System (GIS) database for the study area of Lang Son province (Vietnam) has been employed. LSSVC is used to separate data samples in the GIS database into two categories of non-landslide (negative class) and landslide (positive class). The BA metaheuristic is employed to assist the LSSVC model selection process by fine-tuning its hyper-parameters: the regularization coefficient and the kernel function parameter. Experimental results point out that the hybrid BA-LSSVC can help to achieve a desired prediction with an accuracy rate of more than 90%. The performance of BA-LSSVC is also better than those of benchmark methods, including the Convolutional Neural Network, Relevance Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Logistic Regression. Hence, the newly developed model is a capable tool to assist local authority in landslide hazard mitigation and management.

AB  - Modernization and optimization of irrigated agriculture management can involve substantial conflicting factors using the opinions of experts. A combined approach based on concepts of Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (FMCDM) methods and Mathematical Optimization Programming (MOP) model for water allocation problem has been developed. In the first phase, we calculate the criteria weights using fuzzy AHP with water expert opinions. Then, we determine the performance of various water resources performed through the application of the fuzzy TOPSIS method. In the second phase, we solve the water resource allocation using the MOP model with the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) results. The allocation of irrigation water resources using the proposed approach was tested on Sfax irrigation district, southern Tunisia. The achieved results indicate that the combination of the fuzzy MCDM model and the MOP methods provide effective linkages between irrigation expert opinions, economic return, and performance of water resource objectives.

AB  - Abstract.
Travelers can enjoy a wide range of choices with the assistance of online review websites such as TripAdvisor. Online reviews provided by customers are an important portion of hotels' online business worldwide as they have value in terms of understanding customers' observations of hotels' product and service features. Hotel managers seek to understand travelers' satisfaction and hotel preferences through online reviews to improve their marketing strategy and decision making. This research uses the travelers' generated content in online hotel reviews to provide reasonable and benchmarking understandings about customers' satisfaction and preferences. Hence, the aim of this study is identifying the important factors for hotel selection based on previous travelers' reviews on TripAdvisor. Accordingly, we develop a new method for the use of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) and soft computing approaches. Concentrating on the case study of the Canary Islands hotels, we show how this method can be applied to determine the satisfaction and preferences among travelers that impact their decision in hotel choices. The results help to identify four customer segments for Canary Islands hotels. These segments are “Highly Satisfied Travelers”, “Satisfied Travelers”, “Moderately Satisfied Travelers”, and “Unsatisfied Travelers”, showing that different travelers have various degrees of satisfaction with dissimilar preferences. We found that travelers' preference and satisfaction segmentation is a crucial stage in travelers' behavior analysis to improve the quality of hotels' products and services. This form of analysis can enhance hotel managers' understanding of different market segments according to customers’ satisfaction level and their preferences. The findings of this study will help managers to set priority instructions for improving the corresponding hotel features and use online customer reviews to improve customer satisfaction and hotel performance.

AB  - Identifying the flood susceptible areas is a vital and substantial element of disaster management for every country to control and mitigate injuries of the natural hazards. The current research presents a framework for the preparation of flood prone areas' maps by the integration of Geospatial Information System (GIS), fuzzy logic, and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). To achieve this goal, a spectrum of geophysical, geomorphological, meteorological, hydrological, and geographical criteria have been addressed. Considering the linkage and the interdependencies of the criteria, DEcision-MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach are used to form the network of relations among the criteria. Moreover, considering inevitable uncertainty, ambiguity/vagueness of the experts' opinions, fuzzy theory is integrated with DEMATEL to handle the issue. Finally, Analytic Network Process (ANP) are implemented to calculate the final weight of every single criterion. The Kurdistan province, located in the North-West of Iran, is considered as the case study in which numerous flood events has had recently happened. The efficiency of the model is assessed through the area under the curve (AUC) and statistical measures such as the Kappa index. In order to evaluate the produced classified flood susceptibility map, the map of historical flood events in the province is also used. About 85% of validation area is classified as “Very High flood Susceptible” which implies the efficiency of proposed framework for flood susceptibility mapping. Furthermore, for evaluating the functionality of the framework in comparison with traditional approaches, the well-known AHP methodology is implemented too. The validation results demonstrate that the Fuzzy-DEMATEL ANP model (AUC-ROC = 0.938, Kappa = 0.88) has a higher performance accuracy compare to the AHP model (AUC-ROC = 0.918, Kappa = 0.79). Moreover, comparing the proposed and validation model shows that the proposed framework can effectively improve decision makers to provide flood susceptibility maps, and recognize flood susceptible areas in data-scarce and ungauged regions.

AB  - Flash flood is a typical natural hazard that occurs within a short time with high flow velocities and is difficult to predict. In this study, we propose and validate a new soft computing approach that is an integration of an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), named as PSO-ELM, for the spatial prediction of flash floods. The ELM is used to generate the initial flood model, whereas the PSO was employed to optimize the model. A high frequency tropical typhoon area at Northwest of Vietnam was selected as a case study. In this regard, a geospatial database for the study area was constructed with 654 flash flood locations and 12 influencing factors (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, toposhade, topographic wetness index, stream power index, stream density, NDVI, soil type, lithology, and rainfall). The model performance was validated using several evaluators such as kappa statistics, root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) and compared to three state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, including multilayer perceptron neural networks, support vector machine, and C4.5 decision tree. The results revealed that the PSO-ELM model has high prediction performance (kappa statistics = 0.801, RMSE = 0.281; MAE = 0.079, R2 = 0.829, AUC-ROC = 0.954) and successfully outperformed the three machine learning models. We conclude that the proposed model is a new tool for the prediction of flash flood susceptibility at high frequency tropical typhoon areas.

AB  - In order to develop an efficient framework for global screening in the material exploration, we performed a clustering analysis of machine learning on the multi-dimensional thermophysical properties of the liquid substances. Data mining using a self-organizing map (SOM) based on the unsupervised learning was employed to project high-dimensional thermophysical data onto a low-dimensional space. Here we adopted 98 liquid substances with eight thermo-physical properties for the SOM training in order to group the liquid substances. The present SOM-clustering approach properly categorized liquid substances according to the chemical species characterized by the functional groups.

AB  - Fog computing is a computing infrastructure that supports data distribution between cloud and source in an efficient manner. Building an effective and generalized model for efficient resource selection and allocation mechanism seems to be complex in fog computing. Allocation and selection mechanisms in such environment fall into a class of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. The existing MCDM methods may not be suitable for fog computing environment as these problems are distributed, scalable and dynamic. We propose an adaptive multi-criteria decision-making (A-MCDM) model to obtain an optimal ranking of alternatives in dynamic and scalable environments. The time complexity of the proposed A-MCDM is O(nm) in general, and it takes only O(m) time to assign a rank to an alternative where n is the number of criteria and m is the number of alternatives. The performance of the proposed model has been analyzed and found to be better than other MCDM methods.

AB  - According to the Higher Council for the Rights of persons with disabilities (HCD) disabled people constitute 13% of the Jordanian community, 41% of them are female (Thompson, 2018 [1]; HCD Statistical Report, 2015). 11.2% of Jordan’s population aged 5 years and older had a disability, 84% of them are living in urban areas and are still facing obstacles to accessibility and inclusiveness through urban environments (Thompson, 2018). Planners and policy makers are responsible for ensuring access for people with disabilities through careful planning taking into account the allocation and accessibility of relevant services. It is therefore necessary for them to monitor the accessibility of disabled people to the primary public services needed by disabled individuals. This research methodology integrates Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques with Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques to model the accessibility of disabled people to relevant services in Greater Irbid Municipality Area (GIMA). The resulting map shows the street network classified into four classes of accessibility. It concludes the current situation of accessibility of the disabled people to relevant services and indicates parts of the public urban space. These parts are more likely to be attended by the disabled and provide them better opportunity to mobile and live independently. The lack of a deliberate provision of service has a negative impact on the overall level of accessibility of services for disabled people and makes these services inaccessible to the disabled inhabitants of outlying suburbs. This research provides insight into accessibility of the disabled to relevant services that can benefit in decision support for improving accessibility and locating services and facilities. It also provides a benchmark for developing policies, regulations and a framework for future planning that despite the strong legislative base, there is alack for implementation, supervision and monitoring (Thompson, 2018). The process of accessing services provided within public urban space by the disabled encounter many obstacles and barriers that the society often plans and develops without considering the needs of the disabled. Due to inadequate planning, the disabled are marginalized and imprisoned in their houses, what negatively affects their full participation to urban and social life (HCD, 2015 [3]; Thompson, 2018). Furthermore it provides a methodology that can be used for monitoring accessibility for the disabled in such areas towards achieving sustainable urban development.

AB  - While optimization studies focusing on real-world buildings are somewhat limited, many building optimization studies to date have used simple hypothetical buildings for the following three reasons: (1) the shape and form of real buildings are complex and difficult to mathematically describe; (2) computer models built based on real buildings are computationally expensive, which makes the optimization process time-consuming and impractical and (3) although algorithm performance is crucial for achieving effective building performance optimization (BPO), there is a lack of agreement regarding the proper selection of optimization algorithms and algorithm control parameters. This study applied BPO to the design of a newly built complex building. A number of design variables, including the shape of the building’s eaves, were optimized to improve building energy efficiency and indoor thermal comfort. Instead of using a detailed simulation model, a surrogate model developed by an artificial neural network (ANN) was used to reduce the computing time. In this study, the performance of four multi-objective algorithms was evaluated by using the proposed performance evaluation criteria to select the best algorithm and parameter values for population size and number of generations. The performance evaluation results of the algorithms implied that NSGA-II (with a population size and number of generations of 40 and 45, respectively) performed the best in the case study. The final optimal solution significantly improves building performance, demonstrating the success of the BPO technique in solving complex building design problems. In addition, the findings on the performance evaluation of the algorithms provide guidance for users regarding the selection of suitable algorithms and parameter settings based on the most important performance criteria.

AB  - Utilising diversified forms of energy in combination with advanced energy conversions and thermal energy storages is an effective way of developing high energy-efficient renewable systems for green buildings. In this study, a novel hybrid system for the energy cascade utilisation has been proposed, integrating the hybrid ventilations, the active photovoltaic cooling, the radiative cooling and the phase change materials’ storages. An enthalpy-based numerical modelling using the finite-difference method, which has been developed earlier, was used to characterize the sophisticated heat transfer process. A generic optimization methodology with competitive computational efficiency was applied by implementing the supervised machine learning and the advanced optimization algorithm. Multivariable optimizations for geometrical and operating parameters have been conducted and contrasted between the teaching-learning-based optimization and the particle swarm optimization. The results illustrate that the developed artificial neural network-based data-driven learning algorithm is more accurate and more computational-efficient than the traditional ‘lsqcurvefit’ fitting methodology for the characterization of the optimization function. In addition, the optimal case through the teaching-learning-based optimization is more robust than the optimal case through the particle swarm optimization in terms of the equivalent overall energy generation. This study presents a novel hybrid system for the energy cascade utilisation and a new generic optimization methodology, which are important for the promotion of green buildings with high efficiency of renewable energy utilisation.

AB  - A novel smart management approach is proposed for optimization, management, and analysis of integrated energy systems considering contemporary economic, safety, and environmental policies referred to as 3M methodology. Accordingly, three key scenarios are defined including an urban plant application (S-I), a domestic economic growth policy (S-II), and a sustainable development plan (S-III). The proposed systems are globally optimized considering exergoeconomic, exergorisk, and exergoenvironmental analyses using a weighted multi-objective optimization in accordance with the circumstances of S-I, S-II, and S-III. Subsequently, a suitable optimal system is selected using a hybrid deterministic fuzzy-TOPSIS approach among optimal configurations, and the best working fluid is allocated via system-based multi-scale management. The MGS allocating R718, R141b, R123, R142b, and R365mfc had smaller total environmental impact rate, smaller total cost rate, lower heat losses, and lower consumption of cold utility in all scenarios compared to the CGS. In turn, the CGS allocating R718 had the smallest total specific risk (0.602 injury.MJ−1) in the S-I than the MGS (0.811 injury.MJ−1). However, the MGS allocating R123 had a lower consumption of cold utility in the S-II (3.92 MW) and S-III (3.90 MW).

The highest weight allocates to “customer satisfaction”. The results of house of quality showed that the “convenient and appropriate logistics services” ranked as first, the “implementation of transportation infrastructure for green policies” ranked as second, “having the necessary expertise and experience in similar industries” ranked third which reflects the importance of these requirements comparing to other requirements. The calculation results indicate that the fourth supplier is the final choice of decision making process.

AB  - Gully erosion is considered as a severe environmental problem in many areas of the world which causes huge damages to agricultural lands and infrastructures (i.e. roads, buildings, and bridges); however, gully erosion modeling and prediction with high accuracy are still difficult due to the complex interactions of various factors. The objective of this research was to develop and introduce three new ensemble models, which were based on Complex Proportional Assessment of Alternatives (COPRAS), Logistic Regression (LR), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), Random Forest (RF), and Frequency Ratio (FR) for spatial prediction of gully erosion with a case study at the Najafabad watershed (Iran). For this purpose, a total of 290 head-cut of gullies and 17 conditioning factors were collected and used to establish a geospatial database. Subsequently, FR was used to determine the spatial relationship between the conditioning factors and the head-cut of gullies, whereas RF, BRT, and LR were used to quantify the relative importance of these factors. In the next step, three ensemble gully erosion models, named COPRAS-FR-RF, COPRAS-FR-BRT, and COPRAS-FR-LR were developed and verified. The Success Rate Curve (SRC), and the Prediction Rate Curve (PRC) and their areas under the curves (AUC) were used to check the performance of the three proposed models. The result showed that Soil group, geomorphology, and drainage density factors played the key role on the occurrence of the gully erosion. All the three models have very high degree-of-fit and the prediction performance, the COPRAS-FR-RF model (AUC-SRC = 0.974 and AUC-PRC = 0.929), the COPRAS-FR-BRT model (AUC-SRC = 0.973 and AUC-PRC = 0.928), and the COPRAS-FR-LR model (AUC-SRC = 0.972 and AUC-PRC = 0.926); therefore, it is concluded that they are efficient and new powerful tools which could be used for predicting gully erosion in prone-areas.

AB  - Recently, big data (BD) has attracted researchers and practitioners due to its potential usefulness in decision-making processes. Big data analytics (BDA) is becoming increasingly popular among manufacturing companies as it helps gain insights and make decisions based on BD. However, there many barriers to the adoption of BDA in manufacturing supply chains. It is therefore necessary for manufacturing companies to identify and examine the nature of each barrier. Previous studies have mostly built conceptual frameworks for BDA in a given situation and have ignored examining the nature of the barriers to BDA. Due to the significance of both BD and BDA, this research aims to identify and examine the critical barriers to the adoption of BDA in manufacturing supply chains in the context of Bangladesh. This research explores the existing body of knowledge by examining these barriers using a Delphi-based analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Data were obtained from five Bangladeshi manufacturing companies. The findings of this research are as follows: (i) data-related barriers are most important, (ii) technology-related barriers are second, and (iii) the five most important components of these barriers are (a) lack of infrastructure, (b) complexity of data integration, (c) data privacy, (d) lack of availability of BDA tools and (e) high cost of investment. The findings can assist industrial managers to understand the actual nature of the barriers and potential benefits of using BDA and to make policy regarding BDA adoption in manufacturing supply chains. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to justify the robustness of the barrier rankings.

AB  - A major challenge in cancer treatment is predicting the clinical response to anti-cancer drugs on a personalized basis. The success of such a task largely depends on the ability to develop computational resources that integrate big “omic” data into effective drug-response models. Machine learning is both an expanding and an evolving computational field that holds promise to cover such needs. Here we provide a focused overview of: 1) the various supervised and unsupervised algorithms used specifically in drug response prediction applications, 2) the strategies employed to develop these algorithms into applicable models, 3) data resources that are fed into these frameworks and 4) pitfalls and challenges to maximize model performance. In this context we also describe a novel in silico screening process, based on Association Rule Mining, for identifying genes as candidate drivers of drug response and compare it with relevant data mining frameworks, for which we generated a web application freely available at: https://compbio.nyumc.org/drugs/. This pipeline explores with high efficiency large sample-spaces, while is able to detect low frequency events and evaluate statistical significance even in the multidimensional space, presenting the results in the form of easily interpretable rules. We conclude with future prospects and challenges of applying machine learning based drug response prediction in precision medicine.

AB  - In healthcare service systems, patients are not always served in the order they arrive, but are ranked with respect to their relative “importance” and “urgency” to the service system. We consider such a system where elective admission requests backlogged on a list wait to be assigned inpatient beds. To consolidate the performance of Classified Diagnose and Treatment in China, determining an optimal admission priority assignment policy for all waiting patients is vital. It is a complicated multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem involving both qualitative and quantitative criteria. Evaluating the admission priority of each patient is based on vague information or uncertain data in which significant dependence and feedback between the evaluation dimensions and criteria may exist. This paper applies a hybrid MCDM model that integrates the 2-tuple DEMATEL technique and the fuzzy VIKOR method to the elective admission control problem. It makes use of the modified 2-tuple DEMATEL to determine the relative weights of the evaluation criteria and the fuzzy VIKOR method to assess the alternatives (waiting patients) over the criteria. An empirical case in West China Hospital is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Sensitivity analysis of the results by the proposed hybrid MCDM model and comparative analysis with other different approaches are presented. The results show that the proposed model is effective and provides insightful implications for hospital managers to refer.

AB  - This research wanted to provide evidence that health and worker safety affects the competitiveness of companies and to identify the KPIs that influence the competitive results. For this, we choose to study the Brazilian slaughterhouse industry, which is characterized by an extensive and dangerous work. We identified 33 key performance indicators (KPI) of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) based on Norm 36 of the Ministry of Labor in Brazil. With the application of the Multi Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) method we determined the values of Individual Competitiveness Rate (ICR) of each company and ranked them. For ranking and verification purposes we used Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which allowed the identification of relevant KPIs and to rank, identify, and visualize the differences in relative importance among them. The results show that the Global Competitiveness Rate (GCR) ideal for companies as provided by specialists is 3.48 (1 to 4 scale), and that only 10% of companies have ICR equal to or greater than the GCR pointed out as ideal by specialists. With this data, you can make the companies act in a more targeted way on the indicators, always looking to raise their ICR. The originality of this article is that, through the integration of MAUT and ANN, we can accelerate probabilistic calculations and through the information gain we can identify which KPIs have the most influence on competitiveness and therefore need special attention.

AB  - Effective evaluation of community livability is in urgent need to avoid increased livability at the expense of sustainability. However, studies concerning community livability evaluation were still conceptual, qualitative or conducted at city or regional scales. The availability of abundant, fine-grained, and multi-source data in the big data era laid the foundation for comprehensive livability evaluation at much finer scales. This paper proposed a quantitative and practical method for up-to-date livability evaluation at individual community scale in China. Nine evaluation criteria were identified spanning dimensions of environment, traffic, convenience, and population. These criteria were calculated respectively from remote sensing, surface observation and geospatial big data. The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was applied for community livability evaluation, and the uncertainty and sensitivity of evaluation results were assessed. The livability evaluation in the case study area of Haidian District, Beijing, China demonstrated the practicality and effectiveness of the framework. A total number of 1242 communities in Haidian District were evaluated. Communities in urban area were generally associated with higher evaluation scores and lower uncertainties than those in rural area. The careful selection of criteria weights with high sensitivity, i.e., green space coverage within community and driving time to schools, can potentially significantly reduce the uncertainty of the livability evaluation. The community scale livability evaluation is expected to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementations of livability evaluation, and enables the development of more effective and locally specific regulations and policies to improve community livability.

AB  - GIS-based siting procedures are progressively used to select protected areas (PAs) on the basis of a variety of attributes clustered in main environmental groups including climate, hydrogeology, vegetation cover and various criteria and sub-criteria showing changes in the landscape. However, the suitability of a selecting procedure may be restrained by the aggregate analyses involving the weight and relative importance of the criteria. Here, we integrate a multi criteria decision analysis methodology with geographic information system for selecting a protected region for the vulnerable Kaiser's mountain newt, Neurergus kaiseri, endemic to southern Iran. The process of decision making for selection a PA for N. kaiseri structured in a two-stage. Mask maps are prepared using nine exclusionary criteria including stream density, high ridge density, areas with unsuitable terrestrial vegetation cover, unacceptable land use, harsh climate, inappropriate distance to cities and industries, main roads, railroad, and dam reservoirs. These exclusionary criteria provided an overlay map representing areas grossly suitable for allocating PAs. The initial site screening followed by a multi criteria decision analysis based on ten non-exclusionary criteria including conservation integrity, number of newt localities, MaxEnt suitability score, distance to nearest neighbor habitat, genetic diversity, spring density, distance to protected area, extent of selected patch areas, villages density and distance to main roads. Giving weight and rate to the non-exclusionary criteria all nominated PAs received a numerical evaluation.

In this paper, we study the problem of inconsistency detection and repair of the Ontology Multi-dimensional Data Model (OMD). We propose a framework of data quality assessment, and repair for the OMD. We formally define a weight-based repair-by-deletion semantics, and present an automatic weight generation mechanism that considers multiple input criteria. Our methods are rooted in multi-criteria decision making that consider the correlation, contrast, and conflict that may exist among multiple criteria, and is often needed in the data cleaning domain.

This paper aims to highlight the role of IoT in aircraft spare parts inventory management. According to Klipi et al. (2009), four generic practices are used by airlines for supplying spare parts: in-house sourcing, ad-hoc, cooperative pooling, and commercial pooling. The implications of IoT in these four strategies are assessed. The business model of KLM engineering and maintenance department provided by (Van Rijssel, 2016) is used to elaborate the application of IoT from four perspectives of component and reliability; airlines engineering and maintenance; logistics arrangement and market.

These disruptive technologies are at the center of the fourth industrial revolution, but are we ready yet to educate and prepare new generations to help society, science, and humanity adapt them? How can we change the current curriculum to reflect these technological innovations? How can we help the new generation to develop not only left-brain skills but also right-brain skills? The Netherlands is the second largest food exporter in the world after the United States and the agricultural related exports generated €45 Billion in 2018 for the economy. R&D in Dutch companies and innovation in universities in the Netherlands play an important and active role in this context. In this paper, we provide a general framework for supporting education in the context of Industry 4.0. We adopt the case study of Wageningen University at which we were actively involved in designing and customizing academic courses related to Industry 4.0. Wageningen University, which has the highest rank in the field of Agriculture & Forestry according to influential university rankings and has a rank 59 according to Times Higher Education, is traditionally a life science university but has taken also an active strategy for aligning with the developments in IT and Artificial Intelligence. Apart from the content-wise shift, skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving are addressed by applying project-based evaluations. We discuss the lessons learned and address the issues related to Industry 4.0 and education.

AB  - Forest fires threaten a large part of the world's forests, communities, and industrial plants, triggering technological accidents (Natechs). Forest fire modelling with respect to contributing spatial parameters is one of the well-known ways not only to predict the fire occurrence in forests, but also to assess the risk of forest-fire-induced Natechs. This study is a review of methods based on geospatial information system (GIS) for modelling forest fires and their potential Natechs that have been implemented all over the world. The present study conducts a systematic literature review of the methods used for forest fire susceptibility, hazard, and risk assessment, while dividing them into four general categories: (a) statistical and data-driven models; (b) machine learning models; (c) multi-criteria decision-making models, and (d) ensemble models. In addition, some forest fire detection techniques using satellite imagery are reviewed. A comparison is also conducted to highlight the research gaps and required future research. The results of the present research assist decision makers to select the most appropriate techniques according to specific forest conditions. Results show that data-driven approaches are the most frequently applied methods while ensemble approaches are more accurate.

AB  - Work zone accidents are important concerns for transportation decision-makers. Therefore, knowledge of driving behaviors and traffic patterns are essential for identifying significant risk factors (RF) in work zones. Such knowledge can be difficult obtain in a field study without introducing new risks or driving hazards. This research uses integrated data mining and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods as part of a simulator-based case study of work zone logistics along a highway in Missouri. The research design incorporates k-mean clustering to cluster driving behavior trends, analytic network process (ANP) to determine weights for criteria that are most likely to impact work zones, and the Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method to rank the alternatives (clusters). Transportation engineers and decision makers can use results from this case study to identify driving populations most likely to engage in risky driving behaviors within work zones, and to provide guidance on effective work zone management.

The rapid prevalence and potential impact of big data analytics platforms have sparked an interest amongst different practitioners and academia. Manufacturing organisations are particularly well suited to benefit from data analytics platforms in their entire product lifecycle management for intelligent information processing, performing manufacturing activities, and creating value chains. This needs a systematic re-architecting approach incorportaitng careful and thorough evaluation of goals for integrating manufacturing legacy information systems with data analytics platforms. Furthermore, ameliorating the uncertainty of the impact the new big data architecture on system quality goals is needed to avoid cost blowout in implementation and testing phases.
Objective
We propose an approach for goal-obstacle analysis and selecting suitable big data solution architectures that satisfy quality goal preferences and constraints of stakeholders at the presence of the decision outcome uncertainty. The approach will highlight situations that may impede the goals. They will be assessed and resolved to generate complete requirements of an architectural solution.
Method
The approach employs goal-oriented modelling to identify obstacles causing quality goal failure and their corresponding resolution tactics. Next, it combines fuzzy logic to explore uncertainties in solution architectures and to find an optimal set of architectural decisions for the big data enablement process of manufacturing systems.
Result
The approach brings two innovations to the state of the art of big data analytics platform adoption in manufacturing systems: (i) A goal-oriented modelling for exploring goals and obstacles in integrating systems with data analytics platforms at the requirement level and (ii) An analysis of the architectural decisions under uncertainty. The efficacy of the approach is illustrated with a scenario of reengineering a hyper-connected manufacturing collaboration system to a new big data architecture.

AB  - In this study, three machine learning models, namely, support vector machine, naïve Bayes, and random forest, along with the geographic information system, are used to delineate the tar mat occurrence hazard in the upper part of Zubair Formation (named as DJ unit) in Rumaila oil field, southern Iraq. To build these models, a well inventory map that consists of 213 wells (tar and free-tar) is used with five factors that control the mat distribution in the DJ reservoir unit. These factors are porosity, volume of shale, water saturation, DJ unit thickness, and distance to the major fold axis. Multicollinearity and feature selection tests demonstrate that three of the five factors (distance to the major fold axis, water saturation, and porosity) are responsible for the tar distribution in the reservoir unit. The important factors with well inventory are used to develop the machine models and the results are compared using five evaluation measures namely, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, kappa, and the relative operating characteristics curve. Findings from the models suggest that random forest is the best model, followed by support vector machine with polynomial kernel. The prediction random forest model is used to delineate the mat distribution, and the probability of tar mat occurrence hazard is classified into five zones, namely, very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The produced hazard map in this study can be used as guide in the drilling of new wells in the considered reservoir unit and in avoiding the drilling of wells where the tar expected to occur.

AB  - Health informatics and telematics have been drastically influenced by big data of IoT devices. In this paper, we conducted a review of scientific literature and mapping of research trends on IoT Big Data Analytics paradigm (IoTBDA) in healthcare industry. The goal is to identify how the IoT BDA paradigm has impacted the design, development, and application of IoT based innovations in healthcare services. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative review of 46 papers on IoTBDA, and a quantitative review of 84 papers on fog computing in the healthcare industry. This study shows that IoT BDA has impacted the acquisition, storage, retrieval, and use of information in healthcare industry. Consequently, three derivers of IoT BDA convergence are identified. The first driver is computing; which is emerged as a response to reduce data congestion and inefficiencies of emergency systems. As the co-word analysis shows, issues such as security, privacy and data transfer are dominant scientific topics within the domain of fog computing. The second driver of convergence is the storage of IoT big data. This has led the researchers to classify IoT data to critical and non-critical data; while the critical data is sent to fog systems; non-critical data is sent to centralized cloud systems. The third driver of convergence is data abstraction. The study shows that IoT BDA has sparked the emergence of novel health applications and systems. This paper extends the literature on health informatics and telematics and our understanding of everyday practice of these systems in healthcare contexts. Since IoT BDA and fog computing in healthcare are new fields, findings of this study can act as a basis for future studies to determine novel research opportunities on IoT BDA.

AB  - Economic, social and environmental requirements make planning for a sustainable electricity generation mix a demanding endeavour. Technological innovation offers a range of renewable generation and energy management options which require fine tuning and accurate control to be successful, which calls for the use of large-scale, detailed datasets. In this paper, we focus on the UK and use Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to evaluate electricity generation options against technical, environmental and social criteria. Data incompleteness and redundancy, usual in large-scale datasets, as well as expert opinion ambiguity are dealt with using a comprehensive grey TOPSIS model. We used evaluation scores to develop a multi-objective optimization model to maximize the technical, environmental and social utility of the electricity generation mix and to enable a larger role for innovative technologies. Demand uncertainty was handled with an interval range and we developed our problem with multi-objective grey linear programming (MOGLP). Solving the mathematical model provided us with the electricity generation mix for every 5 min of the period under study. Our results indicate that nuclear and renewable energy options, specifically wind, solar, and hydro, but not biomass energy, perform better against all criteria indicating that interindustry architectural innovation in the power generation mix is key to sustainable UK electricity production and supply.

AB  - In order to reduce the aerodynamic drag and aerodynamic heating of the hypersonic blunt body, the aerodisk and spike are installed on the blunt body. In this paper, the influences of the aerodisk on the aerodynamic drag and aerodynamic heating of the hypersonic blunt body are studied by numerical method. The results show that the drag coefficient and maximum heat flux of the blunt body for the configuration with the aerodisk are reduced by 34.09% and 51.06% respectively compared with the configuration without the aerodisk, and the two configurations achieve the drag and heat reduction by reconstructing the flow field. On this basis, multi-objective design optimization of the hypersonic blunt body with the aerodisk and spike is performed by the weighting method and NSGA-II method. The results show that increasing the length of the spike and radius of the aerodisk can reduce total heat flux of the blunt body. The drag coefficient decreases with the increase of the length of the spike. However, with the increase of the radius of the aerodisk, the drag coefficient decreases first and then increases. In addition, the drag coefficient and total heat flux of the blunt body of typical Pareto optimal solution are reduced by 35.90% and 46.97% respectively compared with original design, and adjusting the weighting coefficient of the weighting method can obtain the Pareto frontier calculated by NSGA-II method.

AB  - Development of a sustainable public transportation network is one of the most important factors for establishing a sustainable city. Failure analysis for public transport systems is not an issue to be adequately addressed. However, this issue has great importance in terms of maintenance planning and reliability. So, this paper aims for prioritizing failures for corrective actions in Bus Rapid Transit System (BRT) by using a hybrid Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodology. In this paper, a prioritization analysis is carried out by using a hybrid mechanism consists of stochastic, fuzzy approaches and Delphi Method for failure with uncertainties. The proposed hybrid MCDM methodology has been applied for the BRT system in Istanbul, Turkey. Both fuzzy and stochastic approaches have been applied to deal with all the uncertainty in the process. To model uncertainties discussed in fuzzy logic more precisely, type-2 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method has been used to determine the weights of the criteria for failures. After the criteria’s weights are clarified, a stochastic TOPSIS method is adopted for obtaining the ranking of the failures in the better model of the probabilistic uncertainty. At all these stages, Delphi method also has been applied to obtain experts’ evaluations. These evaluations are used as input for the proposed MCDM methodology. Finally, identification and ranking the importance of the failures for BRT system have been clarified. So that it is aimed to support decision makers in taking the maintenance decisions of the vehicles by using the proposed approach.

AB  - This study proposes a novel decision support system for product ranking problems which integrates multi criteria decision making (MCDM) and aspect level sentiment analysis techniques. The main purpose of the developed methodology is to rank the alternative products taking into account a set of product criteria and the customer comments related to these criteria posted on websites to recommend the most appropriate alternative to potential customers. The decision support system comprises two stages, in the first stage, the online customer reviews are transformed into customer satisfaction scores through aspect level sentiment analysis to obtain performance scores corresponding to alternative products, whereas the second stage deals with ranking the alternative products via a novel MCDM methodology, namely “IF-ELECTRE integrated with VIKOR” according to the performance scores obtained in the first level. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) are utilized to effectively represent the customer reviews including hesitant expressions in decision matrix. The weights of criteria (the product aspects of significant importance for customers) are determined using entropy method. The applicability of the developed approach is explored by a case study, in which customer reviews about hotel experiences are evaluated using lexicon based sentiment analysis and alternative hotels are ranked according to the findings from the sentiment analysis by the Intuitionistic fuzzy (IF)-ELECTRE integrated with VIKOR methodology.

AB  - Growing world population along with fast economic growth and increased living standards have increased the municipal waste generation making its management be a foremost global issue. The problem is even more serious in urban areas as its improper management prompts tainting of soil, water, and environment which create public health risks. These problems of waste disposal and management were usually assessed by traditional methods which require loads of data. The recent development in the new software technologies and Internet along with the introduction of gradually more compact and dependable hardware products have presented the ability to accurately deal with these procedures more easily than costly and tedious field experiments. This paper presents an outline of the utilization of different scientific models in solving the environmental problems of municipal waste disposal. The examination of past literature uncovered that usually optimization models were used to find the answer of 'what is the best' under an explicit arrangement of conditions, while, simulation models were usually helpful to get an answer to 'what if? ' due to their predictive capability. An indication of the municipal waste disposal problems and its management alongside the ramifications of the investigation is provided. The rationale and backdrop of the waste disposal issues are described. The applications of optimization modeling, multi-objective approach, multi-criteria decision analysis, and artificial neural networks in waste management are presented and applications of these modeling techniques in diverse case studies worldwide are described. And finally, the conclusions of the analysis are summarized.

AB  - MULTIMOORA is a useful multi-criteria decision-making technique. The output of the MULTIMOORA is a ranking obtained by aggregating the results of the ternary ranking methods: Ratio System, Reference Point Approach, and Full Multiplicative Form. In the literature of MULTIMOORA, there is not a comprehensive review study. In this paper, we conduct an overview of MULTIMOORA by categorizing and analyzing main researches, theoretically and practically. First, we go through an theoretical survey of MULTIMOORA in terms of the subordinate ranking methods, ranking aggregation tools, weighting methods, group decision-making, combination with other models, and the robustness of the method. We scrutinize the developments of MULTIMOORA based on uncertainty theories accompanied by analyzing the mathematical formulations of breakthrough models. Practical problems of MULTIMOORA are categorized into application sectors concerning industries, economics, civil services and environmental policy-making, healthcare management, and information and communications technologies. Bibliometric analyses are implemented into all studies. Also, we pose major theoretical and practical challenges. From the theoretical viewpoint, extensions of Reference Point Approach, cooperative group decision-making structure, and utilization of new uncertainty sets in MULTIMOORA model are the main challenges. From the practical viewpoint, industrial and socio-economic fields are appealing to be studied intensively.

AB  - The previous works on the use of PEM Fuel Cell based power supply system for the operation of off-grid RBS (Radio Base Stations) sites showed a strong influence of system design parameters on the energy conversion performance. In this paper a perturbation of system design is studied with validated models to understand the variability of performance over a full year operation. Moreover, a multi-objective optimal sizing methodology is proposed in terms of the minimization of a functional parameter taking into account costs, RES (Renewable Energy Sources) exploitation and pollutant emission factors. The influence of different weather conditions on the HRES (Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems) performance is analyzed investigating the system behavior for three different locations in Europe. The analysis of three real case studies showed that 20% ratio of the energy produced by fossil fuels over the energy produced by renewables sources can be obtained slightly increasing the PV (PhotoVoltaic) plant size with minor effects on the RES exploitation. Moreover, a lower LCOE (Levelized Cost Of Energy) can be achieved increasing the PV size and reducing battery size with an unavoidable reduction of the RES exploitation. Results for different sites highlighted the obtainment of different optimal sizings for each site. However, similar performance parameters can be obtained in the different case studies for Tilos, Rome and Brighton with an average LCOE of 0.5 €/kWh and a variability in the order of 0.1 €/kWh.

AB  - Standalone photovoltaic system is promising sustainable energy source. Accurate modeling and sizing of these systems strongly affect the system's feasibility. Thus, in this paper, optimal sizing of standalone photovoltaic system is conducted based on multi-objective differential evolution algorithm integrated with hybrid multi-criteria decision making methods. Multi-objective differential evolution algorithm is used to optimize set of configurations of a system by minimizing technical and cost objective functions simultaneously. After that, an analytical hierarchy process integrated with a technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution are used to order preference of configurations based on the loss of load probability and life cycle cost of system. The results of the proposed sizing method are validated by a numerical method to explain the superiority of the proposed method. According to results, the proposed sizing method is faster than numerical method by around 27 times. This is because the multi-objective differential evolution algorithm requires roughly 0.23 of simulations that is required by numerical method. Furthermore, the performance of multi-objective differential evolution algorithm is evaluated by various metrics. As a result, for the adapted load demand, the optimal configuration is 63 PV modules and 66 battery unit with maximum capacity of 500 Ah.

AB  - Industry 4.0 is revolutionizing decision making processes within the manufacturing industry. Among the technological portfolio enabling this revolution, the late literature has capitalized on the potential of data analytics for improving the production cycle at different stages, from resource provisioning to planning, delivery and storage. However, such a promising role of data analytics has been so far explored without a proper, quantitative inspection of the cost-improvement trade-off, nor has the process of acquiring sensors and extracting valuable information from their captured data formalized in a series of methodological steps. This paper introduces the Analyze, Sense, Preprocess, Predict, Implement and Deploy (ASPPID) methodology, an iterative decision workflow that spans from the acquisition of sensing equipment to the quantitative assessment of the contribution of their captured data to enhance the production step under focus. By placing the data scientist at the core of the workflow, this methodology helps improvement teams make informed decisions about which parts of the process need to be sensed, and how to exploit this information towards a verifiable improvement of the production cycle. The implementation of this methodology is exemplified in a real use case within the automotive industry, where the detection of defects in an annealing process can be modeled as a classification problem over a highly imbalanced dataset. Results obtained after applying the proposed ASPPID methodology show that the scrap ratio is reduced by sensing the correct part of the process at minimal investment costs, thus highlighting the crucial role of the data scientist in the management team of manufacturing plants.

AB  - In the last few years, machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to solve engineering problems. However, owing to certain complexities found in real-world problems, such as class imbalance, classical learning algorithms may not reach a prescribed performance. There can be situations where a good result on different conflicting objectives is desirable, such as true positive and true negative ratios, or it is important to balance model’s complexity and prediction score. To solve such issues, the application of multi-objective optimization design procedures can be used to analyze various trade-offs and build more robust machine learning models. Thus, the creation of ensembles of predictive models using such procedures is addressed in this work. First, a set of diverse predictive models is built by employing a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Next, a second multi-objective optimization step selects the previous models as ensemble members, resulting on several non-dominated solutions. A final multi-criteria decision making stage is applied to rank and visualize the resulting ensembles. To analyze the proposed methodology, two different experiments are conducted for binary classification. The first case study is a famous classification problem through which the proposed procedure is illustrated. The second one is a challenging real-world problem related to water quality monitoring, where the proposed procedure is compared to four classical ensemble learning algorithms. Results on this second experiment show that the proposed technique is able to create robust ensembles that can outperform other ensemble methods. Overall, the authors conclude that the proposed methodology for ensemble generation creates competitive models for real-world engineering problems.

In this paper, the safety data of laboratories in Southwest University were collected using a safety checklist, and the weight of each factor affecting laboratory safety was analyzed using a Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). The simulation results showed that the model gave a more accurate and reasonable safety risk level of the laboratory, verified the rationality and feasibility of the established method, and realized potential loopholes in the process of laboratory management and college students' operations. According to the evaluation results, the machine learning principle and the existing maintenance knowledge of the evaluation knowledge base are applied to provide effective measures and suggestions for users to complete the process of risk assessment. Through risk assessment, the professional skill and the incident control could be improved. The model was easy to operate and has a good application value for ensuring the personal and property safety of laboratory users.

Comparing the synthesis of gas compositions with experimental data available in the literature is used to validate the model. The synthesis of gas composition and efficiencies of the system is investigated respect to different biomasses considered as gasification fuels. The results indicate that the molar fractions of hydrogen and carbon dioxide are increased and the molar fraction of carbon monoxide is reduced with steam to biomass ratio (STBR). The hydrogen and cold gas efficiencies are improved with decreasing STBR. Hydrogen, cold gas, and exergy efficiencies are enhanced with temperature. The results illuminate that pine sawdust and straw have the highest hydrogen production and legume straw produces the lowest CO molar fraction. Straw has the highest hydrogen efficiency, eucalyptus and straw have the highest cold gas efficiency, and eucalyptus has the highest exergy efficiency. A systematical analytical hierarchy process (AHP)/technique for order preferences by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) couple method are utilized to select the best alternative. The results illuminate that eucalyptus, straw, and pine sawdust are the best candidates, respectively as gasification fuel based on the considered criteria.

AB  - Proximity to green areas makes a positive impact on citizens’ life quality. Sustainability principles generally govern modern urban public park design. This paper proposes a novel Safety Evaluation Methodology of Urban Public Parks (SEMUPP) which includes a multi-criteria solution to rank a set of urban public parks according to their safety level. Eleven groups of Urban Public Park (UPP) safety factors and seventeen quantifiable criteria are proposed as the basis for UPP safety assessment. Modification of Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) technique is applied to solve the constructed multi-criteria decision-making problem (MCDM).

AB  - Advanced data analysis is increasingly popular with materials engineering. There are many interesting applications, e.g., to identify links between material properties and structural behavior. Most of these applications also entail challenges like compliance with safety requirements for parts and components. These challenges often are specific to the engineering domain, which sets them apart from many other disciplines where data-science already is established. To successfully approach materials science problems with machine learning, one has to identify and address these specifics. In this paper, we pursue this question for crack assessment. More specific, we study whether the prediction of critical stress states is feasible only based on simulated surface measurements of a three-point bending structure. To this end, we pursue several approaches to gain insights into crack initiation and material behavior. We compare different data sets and machine-learning methods to identify variables, such as specific surface locations, that are relevant for high prediction accuracy. Based on our analyses, we discuss the applicability of machine learning for component assessment. Finally, we summarize general principles for machine learning with materials and structural engineering.

AB  - Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy is administered intravenously during the treatment of breast cancer. Prior to surgery, doctors recommend chemotherapy to shrink the large size of an invasive tumor. This research work proposes a Deux Machine Learning framework, implementing a double ensemble of Machine Learning algorithms for building an optimized and efficient solution to predict a complete pathological response of patients after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy. Unlike algorithms which focus on the accuracy of prediction, the performance of the Deux Machine Learning framework is measured using a multi criteria decision-making technique known as weighted simple additive weighting (WSAW). The WSAW comprehensive performance score is calculated by considering ten evaluation metrics, namely, Accuracy, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, TP Rate, FP Rate, Precision, Recall, F-Measure, MCC, and ROC. The results are validated using the k-fold cross validation technique, achieving an accuracy of 99.08%. When the performance of the proposed framework is compared with the performance of state-of-the-art classifiers such as SVM and random forest, the results are quite promising. With the growing trend of the applications of Artificial Intelligence in Cancer research, Machine Learning has an important future in prognostication and decision-making.

AB  - In this research, global optimization algorithms were applied to solve the inverse artificial neural network (ANNi) for obtaining the best inputs values of an absorption heat transformer with energy recycling (AHTER) and improving its performance. The ANNi was obtained by inverting an artificial neural network (ANN) which architecture was 16 input variables, 3 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 output variable. The ANNi’s aim was optimizing 1, 2, 3, and up to 4 manipulated input variables, as well as calculating the other 12 input variables not manipulated in the system (AHTER) considering a coefficient of performance (COP) desired. The Cuckoo Search (CS), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithms were used to find the optimal inputs. The results showed that the four algorithms used (ANNi-CS, ANNi-PSO, ANNi-GA, and ANNi-SA) satisfactorily optimize of 1 up to 16 inputs of the ANNi. However, the algorithms of ANNi-CS and ANNi-SA were slightly faster with acceptable accuracy. Additionally, they were carried out two analyses using different COPs values. These analyses showed that both algorithms optimize the AHTER’s inputs for different COP, as well as R>0.988 were obtained with the COP experimental data against COP obtained data by both ANNi models.

AB  - The present study explores the finite element analysis and design optimization of a multi-layered bendable structure (i.e., a device of smart watch) considering delamination characteristics and materials strength conditions. The materials used for device and rubber in the smart watch are polycarbonate and thermoplastic polyurethane, respectively. Mooney-Rivlin model is employed to accommodate the hyperelastic behavior of rubber under large deformation. An evaluation of the delamination between layers and adhesive of the smart watch is conducted based on the cohesive zone model. The present study suggests the physical definitions of the vertical gap and sliding distance to describe the debonding/delamination properties in case of a bendable structure undergoing a large deformation. In the optimal design for the glass thickness, display thickness and radius of curvature, the bi-objective formal optimization is formulated to minimize both the vertical gap and sliding distance subjected to constraints on materials strength requirements of glass stress and display stress. The optimal design solutions are obtained using 2nd order polynomial based response surface models and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) in the context of multi-objective approximate optimization. In the optimization result, the sliding distance is improved by 25.64% with the secured stress limits compared to an initial design. The sliding distance value has been more enhanced under the contribution of the shear mode of delamination than the vertical gap under the normal mode. The study accommodates more enhanced design solutions to minimize debonding/delamination properties under strength requirements.

AB  - Understanding and predicting the ecological consequences of different management alternatives is becoming increasingly important to support environmental management decisions. Ecological models could contribute to such predictions, but in the past this was often not the case. Ecological models are often developed within research projects but are rarely used for practical applications. In this synthesis paper, we discuss how to strengthen the role of ecological modeling in supporting environmental management decisions with a focus on methodological aspects. We address mainly ecological modellers but also potential users of modeling results. Various modeling approaches can be used to predict the response of ecosystems to anthropogenic interventions, including mechanistic models, statistical models, and machine learning approaches. Regardless of the chosen approach, we outline how to better align the modeling to the decision making process, and identify six requirements that we believe are important to increase the usefulness of ecological models for management support, especially if management decisions need to be justified to the public. These cover: (i) a mechanistic understanding regarding causality, (ii) alignment of model input and output with the management decision, (iii) appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions, (iv) uncertainty quantification, (v) sufficient predictive performance, and (vi) transparent communication. We discuss challenges and synthesize suggestions for addressing these points.

AB  - Cloud computing refers to providing computing services and resources over the Internet. The cloud provider is an organization or company which offers the services to the consumer at different levels of features and characteristics. However, as the growth of cloud services as well as cloud service providers are increasing rapidly, it is becoming a challenge for consumers to choose the best service provider based on their requirements. In this paper, we propose a method to help the consumer to answer this question. A hybrid multi criteria decision method (MCDM) is developed to evaluate and rank cloud service providers from Smart data. Furthermore, this method considers the interdependencies and relations between the performance measurements. The hybrid method consists of two components: (i) clustering the providers using k-means algorithm to consolidate cloud service providers with similar features and (ii) applying MCDM methods using DEMATEL-ANP to rank clusters and make a final decision. The proposed method also considers the existing workloads of the organization as well as assigns different importance and weights for a set of criteria by clustering the cloud service providers using k-means algorithm. A simulation on the MATLAB was performed to evaluate the proposed method, and the results indicate how the proposed hybrid approach can provide an accurate and efficient way to select the best providers.

Utilizing player and team data collected from various web sources, we propose an expert system to better predict NHL game outcomes as well as improve recruiting and salary decisions. The system combines principal components analysis, nonparametric statistical analysis, a support vector machine (SVM), and an ensemble machine learning algorithm to predict whether a hockey team will win a game. The ensemble methods improve upon the reference SVM classifier, and the ensemble models’ predictive accuracy for the testing set exceeds 90%. The comparison of several ensemble machine learning approaches specifies opportunities to improve the accuracy of game outcome prediction. The system makes it simple for users to employ the learning methodologies and input data sources, evaluate model results, and address the challenges and concerns inherent in predicting hockey game wins.

AB  - With the rise of the Internet, there is a growing need to build intelligent systems that are capable of efficiently dealing with early risk detection (ERD) problems on social media, such as early depression detection, early rumor detection or identification of sexual predators. These systems, nowadays mostly based on machine learning techniques, must be able to deal with data streams since users provide their data over time. In addition, these systems must be able to decide when the processed data is sufficient to actually classify users. Moreover, since ERD tasks involve risky decisions by which people’s lives could be affected, such systems must also be able to justify their decisions. However, most standard and state-of-the-art supervised machine learning models (such as SVM, MNB, Neural Networks, etc.) are not well suited to deal with this scenario. This is due to the fact that they either act as black boxes or do not support incremental classification/learning. In this paper we introduce SS3, a novel supervised learning model for text classification that naturally supports these aspects. SS3 was designed to be used as a general framework to deal with ERD problems. We evaluated our model on the CLEF’s eRisk2017 pilot task on early depression detection. Most of the 30 contributions submitted to this competition used state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that our classifier was able to outperform these models and standard classifiers, despite being less computationally expensive and having the ability to explain its rationale.

AB  - Drop-on-demand (DOD) bioprinting has been widely used in tissue engineering due to its high-throughput efficiency and cost effectiveness. However, this type of bioprinting involves challenges such as satellite generation, too-large droplet generation, and too-low droplet speed. These challenges reduce the stability and precision of DOD printing, disorder cell arrays, and hence generate further structural errors. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) design method for DOD printing parameters through fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) is proposed in order to solve these challenges. The MOO problem comprises two objective functions: to develop the satellite formation model with FCNNs; and to decrease droplet diameter and increase droplet speed. A hybrid multi-subgradient descent bundle method with an adaptive learning rate algorithm (HMSGDBA), which combines the multi-subgradient descent bundle (MSGDB) method with Adam algorithm, is introduced in order to search for the Pareto-optimal set for the MOO problem. The superiority of HMSGDBA is demonstrated through comparative studies with the MSGDB method. The experimental results show that a single droplet can be printed stably and the droplet speed can be increased from 0.88 to 2.08 m·s−1 after optimization with the proposed method. The proposed method can improve both printing precision and stability, and is useful in realizing precise cell arrays and complex biological functions. Furthermore, it can be used to obtain guidelines for the setup of cell-printing experimental platforms.

AB  - Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are an important type of environmental organic pollutants. However, it is lack of sufficient information relating to their potential adverse effects on human health and the environment due to the limited resources. Thus, using in silico technologies to assess their potential hazardous effects is urgent and promising. In this study, quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and classification models were constructed using a set of NACs based on their mutagenicity against Salmonella typhimurium TA100 strain. For QSAR studies, DRAGON descriptors together with quantum chemistry descriptors were calculated for characterizing the detailed molecular information. Based on genetic algorithm (GA) and multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses, we screened descriptors and developed QSAR models. For classification studies, seven machine learning methods along with six molecular fingerprints were applied to develop qualitative classification models. The goodness of fitting, reliability, robustness and predictive performance of all developed models were measured by rigorous statistical validation criteria, then the best QSAR and classification models were chosen. Moreover, the QSAR models with quantum chemistry descriptors were compared to that without quantum chemistry descriptors and previously reported models. Notably, we also obtained some specific molecular properties or privileged substructures responsible for the high mutagenicity of NACs. Overall, the developed QSAR and classification models can be utilized as potential tools for rapidly predicting the mutagenicity of new or untested NACs for environmental hazard assessment and regulatory purposes, and may provide insights into the in vivo toxicity mechanisms of NACs and related compounds.

All the proposed clustering steps adapt completely with the distributed Spark computation framework and the data dependency reaches its least possible using the density reachability concept. By proposing a Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) localized subclustering method, disk I/O burden of the MapReduce based clustering approaches has been solved as well. The comparison of the clustering results with similar works shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm in precision and cluster validity indexes. The proposed method also shows relative robustness to the presence of noise in comparison with similar recent works. The proposed approach shows better precision and validity index in comparison with MapReduce base algorithms while outperforming MapReduce based approaches in computational burden. The scalability of the proposed method is almost similar to the standard Spark machine learning library.

AB  - Building a well-structured objectives hierarchy is central to multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). However, in the absence of a systematic methodology to support the process, this task has been described as “more art than science”. Objectives hierarchies often tend to become large and constraining the size of a hierarchy can be challenging. This paper proposes and illustrates the use of a set of methods to support the simplification of the hierarchies in contexts that are “data rich” and characterised by many objectives. The aim of using the proposed approach is to support decision analysts in developing an appropriately concise decision model for the further interactions with the stakeholders. Using data from two completed environmental cases we show retrospectively how qualitative (means-ends networks), semi-quantitative (relevancy analysis) and quantitative (correlation analysis, principal component analysis, local sensitivity analysis of weights) methods, used alone or in combination, can inform hierarchy development. We evaluate the potential benefits and challenges of each method and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the simplification of an objectives hierarchy. Questionnaire-based relevancy analysis can be a useful method to identify and communicate important objectives in the early phases of an MCDA process with stakeholders, while correlation analysis can help to identify overlapping objectives, particularly in cases having many objectives and alternatives. It is intended that the methods support a facilitator in developing a clear understanding of the problem and also prompt deeper thinking about and discussion of the appropriate structure and content of an objectives hierarchy with the stakeholders involved.

AB  - Efficient and reliable space transportation systems are fundamental to the future success of routine scientific, commercial and strategic space missions. RBCC (rocket-based combined cycle) comprising rocket, ramjet and scramjet engines is a propulsion technology that offers promise for reusable space launch systems owing to advantages over traditional propulsion in various aspects including efficiency and flexibility. However, the viability of RBCC-powered access-to-space requires careful consideration and its assessment represents a challenge to conventional design approaches due to the highly complex and coupled characteristics of the system associated with multi-mode propulsion and multi-stage launch. This study has been undertaken to examine the performance of a conceptual RBCC-based TSTO (two-stage-to-orbit) system and identify the key requirements and design factors to achieve space launch via this system. Multi-objective design optimization has been conducted with respect to important design criteria by means of evolutionary algorithms assisted by surrogate modeling and trajectory optimization. The influence of RBCC engine characteristics particularly in terms of performance and operation as well as the scaling of the vehicle and propulsion on the overall performance of the TSTO system and its feasibility has been quantified and examined. Furthermore, a comparative study with a rocket-only-based TSTO system has also been conducted, verifying the advantages of the RBCC-based TSTO system. The results highlight complex aerodynamic characteristics for both concepts as well as highly nonlinear propulsion characteristics for the RBCC-based concept.

AB  - Although big data, big data analytics (BDA) and business intelligence have attracted growing attention of both academics and practitioners, a lack of clarity persists about how BDA has been applied in business and management domains. In reflecting on Professor Ayre's contributions, we want to extend his ideas on technological change by incorporating the discourses around big data, BDA and business intelligence. With this in mind, we integrate the burgeoning but disjointed streams of research on big data, BDA and business intelligence to develop unified frameworks. Our review takes on both technical and managerial perspectives to explore the complex nature of big data, techniques in big data analytics and utilisation of big data in business and management community. The advanced analytics techniques appear pivotal in bridging big data and business intelligence. The study of advanced analytics techniques and their applications in big data analytics led to identification of promising avenues for future research.

AB  - The Social Web promotes social interactions among people through Web 2.0 technologies. In this context, User-Generated Content (UGC) spreads across social media platforms in the absence of traditional intermediaries that can verify both the believability of the content and the reliability of the sources that generated it. For this reason, the problem of how to assess the credibility of UGC is receiving nowadays increasing attention. In the literature, several approaches have tackled this issue mainly as a classification problem, by categorizing information into genuine and fake. The majority of the proposed solutions follows a data-driven approach, by employing supervised or semi-supervised machine learning techniques that act on multiple features related to credibility. Despite its effectiveness, however, machine learning may present some possible drawbacks, including data-dependency and the possible inscrutability of the contribution that single or interacting features have in the final classification process. In this paper, a Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach is proposed, aimed to assess the credibility of UGC. A given information item (alternative) is evaluated with respect to the considered credibility features (criteria) based on prior domain knowledge, where an overall credibility estimate is obtained by means of a suitable model-driven approach based on aggregation operators. The credibility estimate allows to classify credible UGC with respect to non-credible one, and can also be used to provide a ranking of the alternatives with respect to credibility. To consider interactions among features, the Choquet integral is employed.

AB  - A rockburst is a severe and unexpected damaging seismic event caused by the violent release of accumulated strain energy. To assess the risk of rockbursting, three distance-based multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches with hesitant fuzzy information are proposed. First, considering that each criterion has more than one possible value due to the anisotropic nature of rock masses, hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) are used to describe initial fuzzy evaluation information. To calculate comprehensive criteria weights, the traditional experts grading method and entropy weights model are extended with HFSs. Afterward, three distance-based MCDM methods are adopted to obtain the ranking orders of alternatives, and the final results and specific levels of rockburst risk are determined by the dominance theory. Finally, the proposed methodology is utilized to evaluate the rockburst risk for deep shafts in the Xincheng gold mine. The strengths of this methodology are demonstrated through comparison analysis. Results indicate that the evaluation of risk is consistent with observed field conditions, and the proposed methodology is feasible and effective for evaluating the risk of rockbursting in shafts. Based on these results, some implications for the management of rockburst risk are provided to guide the construction of deep shafts.

AB  - The big data samples are important source for analytics. However, its relevant/irrelevant information, unspecified variables/scales, noise/null, and so forth impose huge challenges on the analysis of relevance, feature, cause, and evaluation. This paper proposes an evidential analytics to disclose buried information in big data samples. Technically, it models memberships composed of relevant preference and replaces data with these priors. Its operations include generating analytics baselines, reducing variables, identifying sparse features, and inducing rules by taking advantage of evidence. In illustration, a case study of semiconductor manufacturing in UCI secom is presented. It discloses relevant signals, key factors, variables’ thresholds, sparse characteristics, and causal effect of damages buried in normal samples. The contribution of this paper not only contains these achievements but provides priori data for inference.

AB  - Disruptive innovations are usually identified as ideas that are created ‘outside the box’. They are expected to fundamentally change existing business models and processes founded on technological applications. Disruptive innovations can be challenging to define. Information technology (IT) solutions focus on collecting, processing, and reporting different types of data. Commonly, is the solutions are expected (in cybernetics or self-regulating processes) to provide feedback to original processes and to steer them based on the data. To achieve continuous improvement with regard to environmental responsibility and profitability, new thinking and, in particular, accurate and reliable data are needed for decision-making. Very large data storages, known as big data, contain an increasing mass of different types of homogenous and non-homogenous information, as well as extensive time-series. New, innovative algorithms are required to reveal relevant information and opportunities hidden in these data storages. Global environmental challenges and zero-emission responsible production issues can only be solved using relevant and reliable continuous data as the basis. The final goal should be the creation of scalable environmental solutions based on disruptive innovations and accurate data. The aim of this paper is to determine the explicit steps for replacing silo-based reporting with company-wide, refined information, which enables decision-makers in all industries the chance to make responsible choices.

AB  - The increasing competition among industries has led to the emergence of numerous tools and methods to support decision making focused on assets maintenance in a company, since ensuring good maintenance is directly linked with greater reliability and uptime for equipment, reducing losses in production processes and consequently increasing profitability. This work aims to use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms - Bayesian Networks (BN) and attribute relevance analysis (ARA), implemented in the Weka® platform, to process a dataset of event logs failure of industrial machine components. The approach aims to use the conditional probability relations generated by the BN and the ranking of criteria relevance for the design of an AHP decision-making model within the scope of industrial maintenance to prioritize which components of a specific machine are more susceptible to failures. The proposed integration mechanism aims to bring greater reliability to the weights assigned to the criteria of the AHP model, and consequently, a more accurate decision support. The results showed that the AHP model generated from a Bayesian Network is consistent with the conditional probabilities estimated by the BN, giving robustness to the decision sphere in the context of industrial maintenance. This AHP model can serve as a basis to be complemented by qualitative analysis criteria according to the need of the individual specialist, allowing the construction of strategic maintenance action plans.

AB  - In north of Iran, flood is one of the most important natural hazards that annually inflict great economic damages on humankind infrastructures and natural ecosystems. The Kiasar watershed is known as one of the critical areas in north of Iran, due to numerous floods and waste of water and soil resources, as well as related economic and ecological losses. However, a comprehensive and systematic research to identify flood-prone areas, which may help to establish management and conservation measures, has not been carried out yet. Therefore, this study tested four methods: evidential belief function (EBF), frequency ratio (FR), Technique for Order Preference by Similarity To ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Vlse Kriterijumsk Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) for flood hazard susceptibility mapping (FHSM) in this area. These were combined in two methodological frameworks involving statistical and multi-criteria decision making approaches. The efficiency of statistical and multi-criteria methods in FHSM were compared by using area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, seed cell area index and frequency ratio. A database containing flood inventory maps and flood-related conditioning factors was established for this watershed. The flood inventory maps produced included 132 flood conditions, which were randomly classified into two groups, for training (70%) and validation (30%). Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) indicated that slope, distance to stream and land use/land cover are of key importance in flood occurrence in the study catchment. In validation results, the EBF model had a better prediction rate (0.987) and success rate (0.946) than FR, TOPSIS and VIKOR (prediction rate 0.917, 0.888, and 0.810; success rate 0.939, 0.904, and 0.735, respectively). Based on their frequency ratio and seed cell area index values, all models except VIKOR showed acceptable accuracy of classification.

AB  - Background
Sleep plays an essential role in repairing and healing human mental and physical health. Developing an efficient method for scoring electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep stages is expected to help medical specialists in the early diagnosis of sleep disorders.
Method
In this paper, a novel technique is proposed for classifying sleep stages EEG signals using correlation graphs. First, each 30 s EEG segment is divided into a set of sub-segments. The dimensionality of each sub-segment is reduced by using a statistical model. Second, each EEG segment is transferred into a graph considering each sub-segment as a node in a graph, and a link between each pair of nodes is calculated based on their correlation coefficient. Graph's modularity is used as input features into an ensemble classifier.
Results
Different community detection algorithm based correlation graph are investigated to discern the most effective features to reveal the differences between EEG sleep stages. A combination of various classification techniques: a least square vector machine (LS-SVM), k-means, Naïve Bayes, Fuzzy C-means, k-nearest, and logistic regression are tested using multi criteria decision making (MCDM) to design an ensemble classifier. Based on the results of the MCDM, the best four: LS-SVM, Naïve Bayes, logistic regression and k-nearest are integrated, to finally utilise as an ensemble classifier to categorise the graph's characteristics. The results obtained from the ensemble classifier are compared with those from the individual classifiers. The performance of the proposed method is compared with state of the art of sleep stages classification. The experimental results showed that the EEG sleep classification based on correlation graphs are able to achieve better recognition results than the existing state of the art techniques.

AB  - The high availability of data as well as intelligent analysis methods are central points of “Industrie 4.0”. However, companies often miss their opportunities because they are not able use available information. In times of a dynamic market environment, it is essential for companies to build up a detailed understanding of the influences on their business based on data. Especially in product development and life cycle management, the use of data-generated knowledge can significantly increase the productivity. The problem is not a lack of information but an information overload, as companies are generating more data than they are actually able to use. At the same time, it is crucial that decision-makers have access to the right information for the right purpose at the right time. Which means, the primarily reason for a lack of data-based decisions is the availability of suitable data. Especially the identification and preparation of data for certain analyses causes a high delay and therefore a decrease of decision quality. A multi-perspective and database-overarching information model of products is necessary to overcome incomprehensibility of information, undefined data structures and inflexibility of systems. The methodology presented in this paper describes the derivation of such an information model, which is collecting and merging selected information from existing databases for business intelligence applications. Key element of the method is the choice of a suitable data source for the required information. Therefore, a data-information-fit-indicator is introduced to enable the assignment of data sources to information of the information model.

AB  - Corporate governance assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of companies’ operations and decisions to ensure value creation for shareholders and optimal risk taking. As investors’ decision making process largely depends on financial information and corporate reports, transparency is capital for the stability of a company, or even the stability of a country via the corporate sector. This research introduces the system reliability theory to properly model the behaviour of companies regarding their corporate governance mechanisms. We propose the assessment of the corporate governance framework by mapping its inputs as components (either in operating or failed state) along with firm characteristics to determine an approximate Structure Function that enables alternatively modeling the functioning of the system, quantifying its reliability and detecting critical components. The advantage of the proposed mapping approach is illustrated using a sample of 1109U.S. listed companies during the period 2002–2014, reporting financial and non-financial information as components of the corporate governance system and the return on assets as the system output. The proposed approach is also useful for modelling other non-engineering sub-systems; companies, financial markets or even economies would be exposed to significant risk if these systems do not function properly.

AB  - Third-party logistics (3PL) has involved a significant response among researchers and practitioners in the recent decade. In the global competitive scenario, multinational companies (MNCs) not only improve quality of service and increase efficiency, but also decrease costs by means of 3PL. However, the assessment and selection of 3PL is a very critical decision, comprising intricacy due to the existence of various imprecisely based criteria. Also, uncertainty is an unavoidable part of the information in the decision-making process and its importance in the selection process is relatively high and needs to be carefully considered. Consequently, incomplete and inadequate data or information may occur among other various selection criteria, which can be termed as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Interval rough numbers are very flexible to model this type of uncertainty occurring in MCDM problems. Thus this paper presents a new integrated interval rough number (IRN) approach based on the Best Worst Method (BWM) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method along Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison (MABAC) to evaluate 3PL providers. The hybrid IRN-BWM based methodology is used for computing the priority weights of criteria while IRN-WASPAS and IRN-MABAC are employed to achieve the final ranking of 3PL providers. A computational study is performed to illustrate the proposed approaches along with a sensitivity analysis on different sets of criteria weight coefficient values to validate the stability of the suggested methodology. Consequently, a comparative analysis of the obtained ranking results with their crisp and fuzzy counterparts is also conducted for checking the reliability of the proposed approach. The results display stability in ranking of alternative results and prove the feasibility of the proposed approach to handle MCDM problems with IRNs.

AB  - When the photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal energy (STE) systems, which share the rooftop area, are installed in the same building, a trade-off problem occurs in terms of the energy, economic, and environmental aspects, and thus, steps need to solve this problem. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a multi-criteria decision support system of the PV and STE systems using the multi-objective optimization algorithm. This system was developed in the following six steps: (i) database establishment; (ii) designing the variables of the PV and STE systems; (iii) development of the analysis engine of the PV and STE systems; (iv) environmental and economic assessment from the life cycle perspective; (v) integrated multi-objective optimization (iMOO) with a genetic algorithm; and (vi) establishment of a multi-criteria decision support system. To verify the robustness and reliability of the developed model, an analysis of “D” City Hall and “I” Airport as target facilities was performed. The optimal PV and STE systems that consider the energy, economic, and environmental aspects at the same time were determined with respect to the 1.23 × 1015 and 1.05 × 1016 installation scenarios, respectively, in terms of effectiveness. The iMOO scores of the existing PV and STE systems installed in “D” City Hall and “I” Airport were 0.358 and 0.346, respectively, whereas those of the optimal solutions were 0.249 and 0.280, showing score improvements. In terms of efficiency, the times required for determining the optimal solutions were 20 and 30 min, respectively. The developed model makes the final decision-maker to find the optimal solution in introducing the PV and STE systems in the early design phase at the same time.

AB  - Biobased chemistry has gained interest and has the potential to tackle some of the sustainability challenges the chemical industry must endure. Sustainability impacts need to be evaluated and monitored to highlight the advantages and pitfalls of different biobased routes over the entire product life cycle. This study aims for expert consensus concerning indicators needed and preferred for sustainability analysis of biobased chemicals in Europe. Experts are consulted by means of a Delphi method with stakeholders selected from three core groups: the private, public and academic sector. Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) is performed to gather data on the prioritization of the sustainability indicators per respondent. Afterwards, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is used to develop a consensus ranking among the experts. The results show that GHG emissions, market potential and acceptance of biobased materials are deemed the most crucial indicators for respectively environmental, economic and social sustainability. Expert consensus is positive in all three sustainability domains, with the strongest consensus measured for environmental sustainability showing a median Kendall’s τ of 0.63 (τ ranging from -1 to 1) and the weakest consensus found within social sustainability showing a median Kendall’s τ of 0.50. Further research can apply the ranked indicators on specific case studies to evaluate the practicability of the defined indicator set.

To achieve a full coverage of the relevant studies to the scope of the research, a three-decade time span of the publishing date of the existing studies was taken into account. The review focuses on the studies utilized ANN to analyze the energy-related issues associated with buildings in major areas, including modeling of water heating and cooling systems, heating and cooling loads prediction, modeling heating ventilation air conditioning systems, indoor air temperature prediction, and building energy consumption prediction. Moreover, the findings of the abundant reviewed studies along with the potential future research to be carried out are discussed elaborately. Regarding the comprehensive review conducted, it is found out that the majority of studies focused on building energy consumption and indoor air temperature prediction. Additionally, it is observed that there has been a growing interest in the application of newly-developed ANNs to BEA areas, such as general regression neural network and recurrent neural network, due to their abilities in improving the modeling and prediction of buildings energy analysis. It is believed that this thorough review paper is useful for the researchers and scientific engineers working on the application of AI-based techniques to the building-energy-related areas to find out the relevant references and current state of the field.

AB  - Improvements of Machine Learning-based landslide prediction models can be made by optimizing scale, customizing training samples to provide sets with the best examples, feature selection, etc. Herein, a novel approach, named Cross-Scaling, is proposed that includes the mixing of training and testing set resolutions. Hypothetically, training on a coarser resolution dataset and testing the model on a finer resolution should help the algorithm to better generalize ambiguous examples of landslide classes and yield fewer over/underestimations in the model. This case study considers the City of Belgrade area for training and its south-eastern suburb for testing. The dataset is exceptionally rich with detailed geological, morphological and environmental data, so 24 landslide predictors were used for multi-class mapping: Class 0 – stable ground, Class 1 - dormant landslides, and Class 2 – active landslides. Two state-of-the-art algorithms were implemented: Support Vector Machines and Random Forest. Additionally, our modelling included variants with an implemented feature selection by using the Information Gain and Correlation Feature Selection. All these variants were modelled across four resolutions - 25, 50, 100 and 200 m, whereby Cross-Scaling was implemented as follows: training on 50 and testing on 25, training on 100 and testing on 25, training on 100 and testing on 50, training on 200 and testing on 25, training on 200 and testing on 50, and finally, training on 200 and testing on 100 m resolution datasets. The results clearly show that Cross-Scaling improves the performance of the model, especially for Class 2, when compared to the performance of their non-Cross-Scaled counterparts; this thereby proves the initial hypothesis. Random Forest models tend to be less sensitive to scale and feature selection effects than the SVM. Class 1 remains the most difficult to discern, leaving some room for even further customization and adjustments. In conclusion, the Cross-Scaling technique is proposed as a method that could become a promising tool for training/testing protocols in landslide assessment.

AB  - This research introduces a scientific methodology for gully erosion susceptibility mapping (GESM) that employs geography information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision analysis. The model was tested in Semnan Province, Iran, which has an arid and semi-arid climate with high susceptibility to gully erosion. The technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) models were integrated. The important aspect of this research is that it did not require gully erosion inventory maps for GESM. Therefore, the proposed methodology could be useful in areas with missing or incomplete data. Fifteen variables reflecting topographic, hydrologic, geologic, environmental and soil characteristics were selected as proxies for gully erosion conditioning factors (GECFs). The experiment was conducted using 200 sample points that were selected randomly in the study area, and the weights of criteria (GECFs) were obtained using the AHP model. In the next step, the TOPSIS model was applied, and the weight of each alternative (sample points) was obtained. Kriging and inverse distance-weighted (IDW) methods were used for interpolation and GESM. Natural break method was used for classifying gully erosion susceptibility into five classes, from very low to very high. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used for validation. AHP results showed that distance to stream (0.14), slope degree (0.13) and distance to road (0.12) played major roles in controlling gully erosion in the study area. The values of points obtained by using the TOPSIS model ranged from 0.321 to 0.808. Verification results showed that kriging had higher prediction accuracy than IDW. The GESM results obtained by this methodology can be used by decision makers and managers to plan preventive measures and reduce damages due to gully erosion.

AB  - This study presents an analysis of three models associated with artificial intelligence as tools to forecast the generation of urban solid waste in the city of Bogotá, in order to learn about this type of waste's behavior. The analysis was carried out in such a manner that different efficient alternatives are presented. In this paper, a possible decision-making strategy was explored and implemented to plan and design technologies for the stages of collection, transport and final disposal of waste in cities, while taking into account their particular characteristics. The first model used to analyze data was the decision tree which employed machine learning as a non-parametric algorithm that models data separation limitations based on the learning decision rules on the input characteristics of the model. Support vector machines were the second method implemented as a forecasting model. The primary advantage of support vector machines is their proper adjustment to data despite its variable nature or when faced with problems with a small amount of training data. Lastly, recurrent neural network models to forecast data were implemented, which yielded positive results. Their architectural design is useful in exploring temporal correlations among the same. Distribution by collection zone in the city, socio-economic stratification, population, and quantity of solid waste generated in a determined period of time were factors considered in the analysis of this forecast. The results found that support vector machines are the most appropriate model for this type of analysis.

AB  - This paper reports the identification modus operandi (in Phase-I) of prospective sites to situate nuclear power plants (NPPs) in Saudi Arabia. Currently, the nation has taken a strategic imitative to introduce nuclear power to resolve future energy crises. Potential areas for installing these NPPs were determined via geographical information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision making approach. Nine significant criteria were applied to screen out unsuitable areas for such NPPs construction. Results revealed that scarcity of water in Saudi Arabia was the major reason to discard 96% of the possible sites. Furthermore, the overlaying process of all these criteria could dispose of nearly 98% of the contiguous Saudi lands. The remaining 2% land area was discerned to be suitable for positioning NPPs, which amounts to an area coverage of 21473 km2 and 13395 km2 on the western and eastern coast, respectively. The dominant siting issues on the western coast were related to the geological features (slope, fault, and flood), while the population concern could overweigh the others on the eastern coast. Meanwhile, the survey revealed that the sea-level rise sensitivity must be considered on the eastern coast for the safe operation of NPPs. Further analyses disclosed that sea-level rise of about 2 m could reduce the possible land areas by 20% and 13% in the eastern and western coast correspondingly. The net feasible areas were inversely proportional to the aggregation of suitable lands into specific NPP footprint. It was established that the proposed assemblage strategy could reduce the net effective area on the western coast for siting the NPPs such as SMR350 (small reactor), AP1000 (moderate reactor) and EPR1600 (large reactor) by almost 22%, 37%, and 47%, respectively. Present findings may constitute a basis for future development in selecting particular sites for NPP installation in Saudi Arabia.

AB  - In order to identify flood-prone areas with limited flood inventories, a semi-supervised machine learning model—the weakly labeled support vector machine (WELLSVM)—is used to assess urban flood susceptibility in this study. A spatial database is collected from metropolitan areas in Beijing, including flood inventories from 2004 to 2014 and nine metrological, geographical, and anthropogenic explanatory factors. Urban flood susceptibility is mapped and compared using logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and a support vector machine. Model performances are evaluated using four evaluation indices (accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score) as well as the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results show that WELLSVM can better utilize the spatial information (unlabeled data), and it outperforms all comparison models. The high-quality WELLSVM flood susceptibility map is thus applicable to efficient urban flood management.

Edge trimming was conducted at different levels of cutting speed, feed speed, and radial depth of cut using a 2k factorial design. The effects of cutting parameters on tool wear, surface roughness and tool temperature were analyzed and discussed. Data generalization was performed by training multiple neural network structures (NN) where the input vector of the neural networks contained sensor data in addition to typical process parameters. TOPSIS was used to select the optimal cutting conditions that could generate minimum tool wear, surface roughness, and tool temperature simultaneously while maintaining high production rates. The results show that the NN models offer better results when sensor data is fused in the input vector. TOPSIS optimum conditions were confirmed by validation experiments and were found to be accurate.

AB  - Recognition of mineralization-related geochemical footprints and modeling their multi-element dispersion patterns are important aspects to consider when “vectoring” toward undiscovered ore deposits. The collection, analysis, and interpretation of stream sediment geochemical data together make an exploration method that has proven to be successful at the district scale mineral exploration targeting. Identifying the possible sources of stream sediment geochemical anomalies and mapping evidence (i.e., footprints) of the underlying ore-forming processes, however, are not trivial tasks. This is because stream sediment samples represent transported material reflecting the entire geology upstream from the sample locations. Furthermore, indicator element distribution patterns are commonly strongly affected by local factors such as regolith, topographic gradient, vegetation density, and/or climate. Therefore, there is a need for finding a better geochemical anomaly separation method regarding the nature of geochemical data obtained from the area sampled. The main objectives of this study were (1) evaluating and comparing the spatial U-statistic and concentration–area fractal modeling methods of anomaly identification, both amenable to spatial analysis, for recognizing geochemical footprints of porphyry copper mineralization, and (2) measuring their performance in the context of district-scale exploration targeting in an area located in southeast Iran. Subsequently, the methods were first evaluated on a dataset of element contents to decompose anomalous populations. Finally, the geochemical model that proved more efficient with respect to predicting the known mineral deposits was integrated with additional evidence maps to delineate exploration targets. Our evaluation of the resulting geochemical targeting model demonstrated that the targets derived from this method are robust and worthy of follow-up exploration.

AB  - A design support system is developed in this work that can be integrated into the car side silhouette design tools and can estimate the drag coefficient of a given silhouette. This task is typically performed via two manners: namely wind tunnel testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Due to the high computational cost for these two approaches, it is impractical to employ them during the silhouette conceptual design stage in a real time. Therefore, a mathematical model is obtained in this study for the drag coefficient estimation of a given silhouette. First, the desired number of silhouettes are generated via a generative design (silhouette sampling) technique so that the silhouettes are evenly distributed in the silhouette design space. Each silhouette is then tested via computational fluid dynamics simulations, and their corresponding drag coefficients (CDs) are obtained. A training dataset is formed with the silhouette geometries and CDs of the silhouettes, and a mathematical model that can estimate the drag coefficient (CD) of a silhouette is finally obtained via principal component analysis (PCA) followed by regression/neural network methods. These three steps are repeated until a desired level of reliable mathematical model is obtained. Finally, three generative design test cases are illustrated based on the mathematical model obtained to predict CD of a given silhouette.

AB  - Flood risk mapping and modeling is important to prevent urban flood damage. In this study, a flood risk map was produced with limited hydrological and hydraulic data using two state-of-the-art machine learning models: Genetic Algorithm Rule-Set Production (GARP) and Quick Unbiased Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST). The flood conditioning factors used in modeling were: precipitation, slope, curve number, distance to river, distance to channel, depth to groundwater, land use, and elevation. Based on available reports and field surveys for Sari city (Iran), 113 points were identified as flooded areas (with each flooded zone assigned a value of 1). Different conditioning factors, including urban density, quality of buildings, age of buildings, population density, and socio-economic conditions, were taken into account to analyze flood vulnerability. In addition, the weight of these conditioning factors was determined based on expert knowledge and Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP). An urban flood risk map was then produced using flood hazard and flood vulnerability maps. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and Kappa statistic were applied to evaluate model performance. The results demonstrated that the GARP model (AUC-ROC = 93.5%, Kappa = 0.86) had higher performance accuracy than the QUEST model (AUC-ROC = 89.2%, Kappa = 0.79). The results also indicated that distance to channel, land use, and elevation played major roles in flood hazard determination, whereas population density, quality of buildings, and urban density were the most important factors in terms of vulnerability. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can help in flood risk mapping, especially in areas where detailed hydraulic and hydrological data are not available.

AB  - Software as a Service (SaaS) has emerged as the most widely used of all the current software delivery models. With the growth of edge computing, as SaaS services increasingly become distributed, selecting the best SaaS provider from those available is challenging but it is of critical importance. In the recent past, well-known cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft have developed frameworks and service quality pillars for cloud applications. However, there are currently no mechanisms for product users to know if and to what extent a service satisfies the defined service pillar. Having such information would enable users to form trustworthy associations in edge computing. In this paper, we address this drawback by adopting a systematic approach of analysing customer reviews related to SaaS products and ascertain to which service quality pillar they refer. We use eleven traditional machine learning classification approaches and a weighted voting ensemble of these classifiers to achieve this task and test the performance of each of them. Since the dataset is unbalanced in terms of sample distribution per class, we use 10-fold cross-validation on the training dataset to determine the best parameters for each machine learning algorithm to achieve optimal performance. Friedman test and Nemenyi’s post hoc test is applied to identify the significant difference among the classifiers performance during cross-validation. Based on the experimental results, a comparative analysis is conducted to identify the best performing machine learning classification model on the SaaS reviews. The results show that the performance of the logistic regression model has a higher performance among the individual classifiers and the weighted voting ensemble shows minimal improvement in overall performance.

AB  - In this paper, dynamic performance identification for a direct expansion (DX) air conditioning (AC) system is proposed using Bayesian artificial neural network (ANN). The input and output datasets are generated by a dedicated AC simulator by varying the compressor speed in various signal amplitudes and including dynamic cooling load and ambient temperature. The exergy destruction, which represents the work potential losses in the system and room temperature indicating the thermal comfort are selected as the output variables. The key parameters of an ANN model, including the number of neurons and tapped delay lines, are optimized to improve the prediction accuracy. The results show that the dynamic response of the exergy destruction and room temperature can be predicted accurately by the optimized ANN model using three neurons, a Bayesian regularization algorithm, five delayed inputs for the compressor speed and room temperature, and six delayed inputs for the cooling load and ambient temperature. The validation of the multi-step-ahead prediction showed satisfying results with respect to the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) and coefficient of variations (CVs) of the room temperature (RMSE: 0.18 °C and CV: 0.85%) and exergy destruction (RMSE: 1.79 W and CV: 0.4%). Accordingly, the identification of the AC system behavior presented in this paper could be further implemented to control the DX AC system operation to achieve a desired thermal comfort with low exergy destruction.

AB  - Machine learning and data-driven models have achieved a favorable reputation in the field of advanced geospatial modeling, particularly for models of groundwater aquifer potential over large areas. Such models built using standalone machine learning techniques retain some uncertainty, including errors associated with the modeling process, sampling approach, and input hyper-parameters. Some of these techniques cannot be applied in data-scarce regions because high bias and variance can lead to oversimplification. Therefore, in the current study, we developed and validated a novel ensemble multi-adaptive boosting logistic regression (MABLR) model for groundwater aquifer potential mapping. This model was validated in a large area of the Gyeongsangbuk-do basin in South Korea and the results were compared to those of different types of machine learning models including multiple-layer perception (MPL), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM) models. A forward stepwise LR technique was implemented to assess the importance of contributing morphological factors; we found 15 factors that contributed significantly: topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic roughness index (TRI), stream power index (SPI), topographic position index (TPI), multi-resolution valley bottom flatness (MVBF), slope, aspect, slope length (LS), distance from the river, distance from the fault, profile curvature, plane curvature, altitude, land use/land cover (LULC), and geology. We optimized the MABLR model using a fuzzy logic supervised (FLS) approach with 184 iterations and then validated the results using accuracy assessment metrics including the κ coefficient, root-mean-square error (RMSE), receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and the precision-recall curve (PRC). Our model had superior predictive performance among the models tested, with higher overall goodness-of-fit and validation values according to the κ coefficient (0.819 and 0.781, respectively), ROC (0.917 and 0.838), and PRC (0.931 and 0.872). Our experimental results demonstrate that MABLR is more effective at reducing bias and variance error than other constituent machine learning methods.

AB  - Sustainable urban surface runoff management is receiving increased attention due to environmental and ecological consequences related to urbanization. This study presents a useful new framework for green infrastructure (GI) planning for the management of urban runoff quality and quantity. The proposed framework considers physical, technical, economic, and multi-stakeholder aspects related to urban runoff management while simultaneously addressing the uncertainties of the decision-making process and model parameters. The methodology is applied to regionally locating and sizing low impact development-best management practices (LID-BMPs) while considering the hydrologic and hydraulic impacts. A decision-making multi-objective optimization framework is developed by integrating: 1) a Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network founded on a Storm Water Management Model (SWMM-MLP meta-model), 2) NSGA-II multi-objective optimization, 3) fuzzy α-cut technique, and 4) a decision-making support model based on social choice theory to elicit trade-offs among system cost and LID-BMP performance indicators. The decision-making model, based on Fuzzy Social Choice (FSC) theory, is applied to simulate consensus between stakeholders for a partially cooperative group decision-making problem. The proposed methodology is explored in a catchment located in the northeastern part of Tehran, Iran. Results showed that the SWMM could be effectively replaced with a MLP-based meta-model in simulation-optimization problems for urban runoff management. In the application of FSC methods, the optimal scenarios were effective in reducing the volume of urban runoff and contamination loads while maintaining the optimality of the operation costs. Considering the optimal LID scenario, a reduction of more than 99% in runoff volume and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and a decrease of more than 92% of total suspended solids (TSS), occurred for the lower bound of uncertainty (lower (left) end of the α-cut = 0.3). For the upper bound of uncertainty (upper (right) end of the α-cut level = 0.3), a maximum reduction of 57% was obtained. In applying FSC methods through the decision-making process, the Borda Counting method considered the preferences of all stakeholders best. Moreover, the proposed framework allows decision-makers to decide on the acceptability and reliability of the optimal management scenarios considering their preferences and uncertainties.

AB  - The search for appropriate models for predictive analytics is currently a high priority to optimize anaerobic fermentation processes in industrial-scale biogas facilities; operational productivity could be enhanced if project operators used the latest tools in machine learning to inform decision-making. The objective of this study is to enhance biogas production in industrial facilities by designing a graphical user interface to machine learning models capable of predicting biogas output given a set of waste inputs. The methodology involved applying predictive algorithms to daily production data from two major Chinese biogas facilities in order to understand the most important inputs affecting biogas production. The machine learning models used included logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and k-nearest neighbors regression. The models were tuned and cross-validated for optimal accuracy. Our results showed that: (1) the KNN model had the highest model accuracy for the Hainan biogas facility, with an 87% accuracy on the test set; (2) municipal fecal residue, kitchen food waste, percolate, and chicken litter were inputs that maximized biogas production; (3) an online web-tool based on the machine learning models was developed to enhance the analytical capabilities of biogas project operators; (4) an online waste resource mapping tool was also developed for macro-level project location planning. This research has wide implications for biogas project operators seeking to enhance facility performance by incorporating machine learning into the analytical pipeline.

AB  - This paper introduces Parasol—an open source, interactive visualization library to support the development of web applications for multi-objective decision making. Multi-objective optimization is a popular way to explore competing objectives in environmental management problems. Interactive visualizations allow stakeholders to explore and gain insights about the large, high-dimensional datasets produced by multi-objective optimization. Among visualization methods, parallel coordinates are well-suited for this task. However, current software and open source libraries have limited support for these plots. The Parasol library described in this work provides developers with the building blocks to create sharable, interactive parallel coordinates web applications. Moreover, by incorporating state of the art clutter reduction techniques—such as clustering, linking, brushing, marking, and bundling—Parasol improves upon traditional parallel coordinates visualizations. We demonstrate the benefit of such features through simple examples and by exploring a real-world water resources problem commonly used in multi-objective optimization literature.

AB  - This paper describes the development and application of a multi-criteria decision model to support stakeholder management in city logistics by prioritising among the diversity of stakeholders' goals. The decision model was applied and tested in a longitudinal case study of a city logistics initiative in Sweden with ten stakeholders. The data were collected included semi-structured interviews and surveys with the stakeholders, participant observation and archival records. The results were analysed using a multi-criteria decision model, which utilises the analytic hierarchy process to rank alternative goals and their importance. The proposed multi-criteria decision model provides a structured approach to managing the multiple stakeholders in city logistics and their goals. The model helps to identify the overall goals that need the most attention and which of these goals need to be considered for each stakeholder and to what extent. This paper offers a multi-criteria decision model for stakeholder management in city logistics, something that is lacking in the literature.

AB  - Nearly 1.24 million people die every year in traffic accidents. More than 20% of the number of deaths are pedestrians. Traffic crashes will become, in 2030, the fifth leading cause of deaths worldwide. A considerable amount of these accidents occurs due to either imprudence or lack of dexterity of the driver. More than 70% of traffic accidents are attributed to human error, such as perception errors as distance judgment error or simply by lack of attention. Because of the problem aforementioned, this work proposes the development and discussion of a pedestrian recognition system using an automotive radar of 79 GHz. The main idea is to early detect pedestrians using the micro Doppler characteristics of the human body in near to crash situations (0–15 m). Based on these requirements, at first this work presents the improvement of velocity resolution of the radar system with the objective of extracting the micro Doppler characteristics of the objects. The improvement of velocity resolution was reached assuming the application of multi-objective optimization techniques, in this case Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Search (RS) were adopted, enhancing the quality of the radar signal. Based on radar measures of velocity and range, a machine learning approach was considered in order to classify objects detected by the radar. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was assumed to distinguish pedestrians and non-pedestrians objects. Four different SVM based models were considered in this work, aiming the improvement of both classification performance and speed, comparing three different kernel functions. As a result, it was possible to verify the advantages of the multi-objective optimization to extract the micro Doppler effects based on radar signals. Moreover, the optimization reached the velocity resolution of 0.12 m/s. To conclude, we showed that a model involving a polynomial kernel for the SVM reported better result in terms of accuracy (99.5%), confirming the promising perspectives of vehicles embedded radar-based safety systems.

AB  - There has been an increased interest in resilient supplier selection in recent years, much of it focusing on forecasting the disruption probabilities. We conceptualize an entirely different approach to analyzing the risk profiles of supplier performance under uncertainty by utilizing the data analytics capabilities in digital manufacturing. Digital manufacturing peculiarly challenge the supplier selection by the dynamic order allocations, and opens new opportunities to exploit the digital data to improve sourcing decisions. We develop a hybrid technique, combining simulation and machine learning and examine its applications to data-driven decision-making support in resilient supplier selection. We consider on-time delivery as an indicator for supplier reliability, and explore the conditions surrounding the formation of resilient supply performance profiles. We theorize the notions of risk profile of supplier performance and resilient supply chain performance. We show that the associations of the deviations from the resilient supply chain performance profile with the risk profiles of supplier performance can be efficiently deciphered by our approach. The results suggest that a combination of supervised machine learning and simulation, if utilized properly, improves the delivery reliability. Our approach can also be of value when analyzing the supplier base and uncovering the critical suppliers, or combinations of suppliers the disruption of which result in the adverse performance decreases. The results of this study advance our understanding about how and when machine learning and simulation can be combined to create digital supply chain twins, and through these twins improve resilience. The proposed data-driven decision-making model for resilient supplier selection can be further exploited for design of risk mitigation strategies in supply chain disruption management models, re-designing the supplier base or investing in most important and risky suppliers.

AB  - Floods around the world are having devastating effects on human life and property. In this paper, three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) analysis techniques (VIKOR, TOPSIS and SAW), along with two machine learning methods (NBT and NB), were tested for their ability to model flood susceptibility in one of China’s most flood-prone areas, the Ningdu Catchment. Twelve flood conditioning factors were used as input parameters: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), lithology, land use, distance from river, curvature, altitude, Stream Transport Index (STI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), soil type, slope and rainfall. The predictive capacity of the models was evaluated and validated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). While all models showed a strong flood prediction capability (AUC > 0.95), the NBT model performed best (AUC = 0.98), suggesting that, among the models studied, the NBT model is a promising tool for the assessment of flood-prone areas and can allow for proper planning and management of flood hazards.

AB  - Energy economy models are central to decision making on energy and climate issues in the 21st century, such as informing the design of deep decarbonisation strategies under the Paris Agreement. Designing policies that are aimed at achieving such radical transitions in the energy system will require ever more in-depth modelling of end-use demand, efficiency and fuel switching, as well as an increasing need for regional, sectoral, and agent disaggregation to capture technological, jurisdictional and policy detail. Building and using these models entails complex trade-offs between the level of detail, the size of the system boundary, and the available computing resources. The availability of data to characterise key energy system sectors and interactions is also a key driver of model structure and parameterisation, and there are many blind spots and design compromises that are caused by data scarcity. We may soon, however, live in a world of data abundance, potentially enabling previously impossible levels of resolution and coverage in energy economy models. But while big data concepts and platforms have already begun to be used in a number of selected energy research applications, their potential to improve or even completely revolutionise energy economy modelling has been almost completely overlooked in the existing literature. In this paper, we explore the challenges and possibilities of this emerging frontier. We identify critical gaps and opportunities for the field, as well as developing foundational concepts for guiding the future application of big data to energy economy modelling, with reference to the existing literature on decision making under uncertainty, scenario analysis and the philosophy of science.

Rankings are an unavoidable part of the football world, where high competitiveness and efficiency is a natural factor. One of the techniques to deal with such problems is the use of multi-criteria decision-analysis methods (MCDA), offering an effective approach to not only ranking but also assessing, selecting and sorting given alternatives. In this paper, the Characteristic Objects METhod (COMET) is used in order to create a performance ranking of the top-tier football clubs. The assessment model is identified and compared with the existing benchmark ranking by the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient.

AB  - Increasing concerns over the environmental impacts of agriculture in Europe has led to the introduction of agri-environment schemes (AES) into the Common Agricultural Policy to help mitigate biodiversity loss by encouraging farmers with subsidies for implementing environmentally-friendly farming techniques. However, effectiveness of AES has been mixed and only partially successful in achieving desired outcomes. To improve effectiveness and reduce costs, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) can help support decision-making and determine the most effective management action. Although MCDA has great potential for evaluating policy measures, it rarely considers the context-dependency of species responses to management practices across different landscapes. Landscape simulations can, therefore, be valuable for reducing the uncertainties when predicting the consequences of management actions. A potential suitable simulation system is the Animal, Landscape, and Man Simulation System (ALMaSS), a mechanistic simulation with can improve MCDA with the automatic integration of landscape context and a species ecology and behaviour. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of ALMaSS in evaluating AES management practices across different landscapes and estimate their ability to achieve the proposed conservation outcomes in three species of conservation interest. In this study, the effect of a particular management strategy on a species was dependent on the landscape context, in our case, a combination of landscape structure and the type and distribution of farms, and varied depending on the metrics being measured. We demonstrate how simulations can be used for MCDA to select between management strategies with different costs. Despite the complexity of ALMaSS models, the simulation results provided are easy to interpret. Landscape simulations, such as ALMaSS, can be an important tool in multi-criteria decision making by simulating a wide range of managements and contexts and provide supporting information for filtering management options based on specific conservation goals.

To enhance the effectiveness of FMEA, a great many multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods have been applied for properly evaluating the risk of failure modes over the past two decades. However, there is a lack of study concerning systematic literature review and classification of the researches on this topic. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the FMEA studies using MCDM approaches for evaluation and prioritization of failure modes. To do so, a total of 169 journal papers extracted from the online database over the period of 1998–2018 were selected and reviewed. These publications were classified into 10 categories according to the used MCDM methods, and analyzed in regard to the risk factors, risk factor weighting methods, and risk assessment methods in FMEA. Furthermore, a bibliometric analysis was performed based on the frequency of MCDM methods, number of citations, year of publication, appeared journals, country of origin and application areas. This research supports academics and practitioners in effectively adopting MCDM methods to overcome the deficiencies of the traditional FMEA and provides an insight into its state-of-the-art.

AB  - A new reaction rate system was introduced for differential kinetic simultaneous determination of hydroquinone (HQ) and Catechol (CC). The method is based on the different kinetic behavior of HQ and CC in their reaction with iron (III) in the presence of 1, 10-phenanthroline (Phen) as a chromogenic reagent. An asymmetric double line flow injection manifold coupled with a spectrophotometric detector was designed and optimized using TOPSIS (Technique of ranking Preferences by Similarity to the Ideal Solution) methods based upon AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process). Under optimal conditions, Bayesian Regularized Artificial Neural Network (BR-ANN) trained by back-propagation of errors was utilized as a non-linear model calibration of flow injection manifold. Detection limits of 0.05 and 0.07 mg L−1 were obtained for HQ and CC, respectively. The linear dynamic range was 0.5–3.0 mg L−1 for both analytes. The suggested method was applied for simultaneous determination of HQ and CC in real samples.

AB  - The benefits (B), opportunities (O), costs (C), and risks (R) of green roof (GR) installation have been identified by several studies. However, the inner-dependencies among them, potentially significant in the decision-making process for proper adoption of GRs, have not yet been investigated. In view of this gap, this study investigates the inner-dependencies between the BOCRs of GR installation according to Malaysian experts. BOCRs were collated through a review of the literature and categorized into 11 groups. The enhanced fuzzy Delphi method (EFDM) and fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL) approaches were utilized to investigate the inner-dependencies. The EFDM results revealed that 28 BOCRs were perceived as significant, while the investigation of inner-dependencies showed that stormwater management, contribution to mitigation of urban heat islands, additional structural support, and irregular maintenance were the most influential B, O, C, and R, respectively. Notably, no significant relationships were found among environmental and economic opportunities. FDEMATEL results showed that, to take full advantage of GR installation, the primary focus should be on the most influential (rather than important) Bs and Os. The findings of this research provide stakeholders with insights into the adoption of GR installation, bringing not only environmental benefits but financial upsides.

AB  - Nowadays, sustainability is recognized as one of the most important development paradigms and included in the international and national strategies of almost all organizations. Sustainability assessment methods have been important for monitoring sustainability performance. These methods are developed to help decision-makers in their attempts to make society more sustainable. Various methods have been proposed for assessing the sustainability performance, however, this research is the first attempt to employ fuzzy clustering and supervised machine learning techniques to country sustainability assessment. This research tries to extend the previous sustainability assessment systems by the use of these techniques to reveal the relationships between human sustainability, ecological sustainability and overall sustainability performance by discovering the decision rules. The decision rules discovered from the Sustainability Assessment by Fuzzy Evaluation data of 128 countries are used to predict the country sustainability performance. The method proposed in this paper is flexible to accept large number indicators of sustainability to be used in the assessment of countries sustainability. The results of our analysis on countries sustainability data showed that the proposed method has potential to be used as a decision-making tool for sustainability assessment through a large set of indicators.

AB  - With developments in cloud computing and big data, the term “cloud” has become a household name owing to its characteristics of smartness and connectedness. Cloud-based platforms are associated with people. However, multi-objective decision-making problem in cloud platforms has not been extensively studied. There is no consensus on the reasonable and effective implementation of the decision-making model to select the optimum design scheme in a cloud platform and its establishment to objectively evaluate its significance. In this study, to efficiently and accurately realize the optimal selection of design scheme, a fuzzy evaluation mechanism in handling the vagueness and uncertainty is established, with the advantage of quality function deployment and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm in decision analysis. A case study is provided to validate the proposed approach in cloud platforms. To reveal the advantages of the proposed method, it was compared with other methods such as the requirement-scenario-experience evaluation framework and a rough number-based integrated method. MATLAB programming was used for this comparison and accuracy certification. The result shows that the proposed model is more efficient and dynamic and provided users with multidimensional evaluation based on open and distributed resources system.
