abstract = {In this paper, we describe the methods of manufacturing quality data acquisition, analysis and utilization. The source of quality data in the process of tractor manufacturing, the common analysis methods and the aspects of utilization based on the analysis results are introduced. Supply chain is critical to tractor manufacturing quality because many parts of tractor are from suppliers. Supplier can be evaluated based on data analysis using information from both incoming inspection and after-sales service.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to socialize ongoing research on appropriate criteria for the selection of suppliers in companies in the telecommunications sector, exposing the design of a multi-criteria model, to obtain a correct and adequate prediction of the best provider depending on the variables and criteria that each company has for the selection. The above is raised, because the selection of suppliers is a problem of multicriteria decision making, because it implies both qualitative and quantitative particularities; suppliers are a very important part of the supply chain of all companies, because they depend on the strengthening of supply management and in turn the selection will depend on criteria beyond the subjective or relationships that are had with the providerThe study proposes a descriptive methodology, with a mixed approach (quantitative and qualitative), which begins with sufficient bibliographic review, through the gathering of information with a technical research instrument (survey) to identify the selection criteria that have the companies in the telecommunications sector and finally designing a proposal for a multi-criteria model based on the application of a combination of the multi-criteria tools Hierarchical Analytical Process (AHP) and Diffuse Hierarchical Analytical Process (FAHP) English), for the selection of telecommunications equipment suppliers, considering defining a group of critical factors to evaluate a possible solution of the best and most appropriate alternative.The preliminary results and conclusions are based on the contributions that provide an adequate bibliographic review and the validation of the criteria to be surveyed by suitable personnel, concluding with what the research leads, which is a clear sample that the selection of any type of criteria it takes more and more strength to be at the forefront of global technology.},

abstract = {This paper proposes the use of multi-objective ensemble learning to monitor drinking-water quality. Such problem consists of a data set with an extreme imbalance ratio where the events, the minority class, must be correctly detected given a time series denoting water quality and operative data on a minutely basis. First, the given data set is preprocessed for imputing missing data, adjusting concept drift and adding new statistical features, such as moving average, moving standard deviation, moving maximum and moving minimum. Next, two ensemble learning techniques are used, namely SMOTEBoost and RUSBoost. Such techniques have been developed specifically for dealing with imbalanced data, where the base learners are trained by adjusting the ratio between the classes. The first algorithm focuses on oversampling the minority class, while the second focuses on under-sampling the majority class. Finally, multi-objective optimisation is used for pruning the base models of such ensembles in order to maximise the prediction score without reducing generalisation performance. In the training phase, the model is trained, optimised and evaluated using hold-out validation on a given training data set. At the end, the trained model is inserted into a framework, which is used for online event detection and assessing the model's performance.},

abstract = {Vehicles are becoming increasingly intelligent and connected, incorporating more and more sensors to support safer and more efficient driving. The large volume of data generated by such sensors, however, will likely saturate the capacity of vehicular communication technologies, making it challenging to guarantee the required quality of service. In this perspective, it is essential to assess the value of information (VoI) provided by each data source, to prioritize the transmissions that have the greatest importance for the target applications. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a framework that uses analytic hierarchy multicriteria decision processes to predict VoI based on space, time, and quality attributes. Our results shed light on the impact of the propagation scenario, the sensor resolution, the type of observation, and the communication distance on the value assessment performance. In particular, we show that VoI evolves at different rates as a function of the target application's characteristics.},

abstract = {Many evolutionary computation (EC) methods have been used to solve feature selection problems and they perform well on most small-scale feature selection problems. However, as the dimensionality of feature selection problems increases, the solution space increases exponentially. Meanwhile, there are more irrelevant features than relevant features in datasets, which leads to many local optima in the huge solution space. Therefore, the existing EC methods still suffer from the problem of stagnation in local optima on large-scale feature selection problems. Furthermore, large-scale feature selection problems with different datasets may have different properties. Thus, it may be of low performance to solve different large-scale feature selection problems with an existing EC method that has only one candidate solution generation strategy (CSGS). In addition, it is time-consuming to find a suitable EC method and corresponding suitable parameter values for a given large-scale feature selection problem if we want to solve it effectively and efficiently. In this article, we propose a self-adaptive particle swarm optimization (SaPSO) algorithm for feature selection, particularly for large-scale feature selection. First, an encoding scheme for the feature selection problem is employed in the SaPSO. Second, three important issues related to self-adaptive algorithms are investigated. After that, the SaPSO algorithm with a typical self-adaptive mechanism is proposed. The experimental results on 12 datasets show that the solution size obtained by the SaPSO algorithm is smaller than its EC counterparts on all datasets. The SaPSO algorithm performs better than its non-EC and EC counterparts in terms of classification accuracy not only on most training sets but also on most test sets. Furthermore, as the dimensionality of the feature selection problem increases, the advantages of SaPSO become more prominent. This highlights that the SaPSO algorithm is suitable for solving feature selection problems, particularly large-scale feature selection problems.},

abstract = {Recommender system is a well-known information system which can capture user tastes and produce item recommendations to the end users. Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) additionally take contexts (e.g., location, time, weather, etc) into consideration, and multi-criteria recommender systems (MCRS) utilize user preferences in multiple criteria to better generate recommendations. Both CARS and MCRS have been widely applied in the real-world applications, such as tourism, movies, music and dining. However, there are no existing research which exploits the methods to integrate them together, not to mention the contributions in the area of educational learning. In this paper, we make the first attempt to integrate context-awareness and multi-criteria decision making in the recommender systems by using the educational data as a case study. Our experimental results reveal that it is able to help produce more accurate recommendations by taking advantage of these two recommendation strategies. We also perform experiments on a tourism data set to demonstrate that the proposed methods can also be generalized to other domains.},

abstract = {Emergency Response Services (ERS) in the developing countries face a dual challenge of lack of resources and selection of optimal locations to distribute the available resources. Moreover, the exclusion of urban space details in the previous models leads to unfeasible solutions. Due to variations in the travel time and coverage demand throughout the day, static location problem is not sufficient to provide good solutions. Hence, we propose an approach to incorporate dynamic aspects like demand, travel time, and coverage area in developing an asset location model. We also incorporate the influence of urban settlement elements like built-up compactness etc. in the model to find the suitable locations for building mini and large fire stations. Our formulated a mixed integer program tries to maximize the empirical demand coverage by firefighting vehicles. The solution is applied to the southern region of Mumbai. When compared to the existing scenario an approximate increase of 10 to 15% increase in the demand coverage by various vehicles is achieved. It is observed that increasing the resources further increases the demand coverage.},

abstract = {The hypervolume subset selection problem (HSSP) aims at approximating a set of n multidimensional points in Rd with an optimal subset of a given size. The size k of the subset is a parameter of the problem, and an approximation is considered best when it maximizes the hypervolume indicator. This problem has proved popular in recent years as a procedure for multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. Efficient algorithms are known for planar points (d=2), but there are hardly any results on HSSP in larger dimensions (d≥3). So far, most algorithms in higher dimensions essentially enumerate all possible subsets to determine the optimal one, and most of the effort has been directed toward improving the efficiency of hypervolume computation. We propose efficient algorithms for the selection problem in dimension 3 when either k or n-k is small, and extend our techniques to arbitrary dimensions for k≤3.},
