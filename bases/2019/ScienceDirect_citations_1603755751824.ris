AB  - This study provides a new comparative analysis of four hybrid artificial intelligence models for the spatially explicit prediction of wildfire probabilities. Each model consists of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) combined with a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, i.e., genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), and imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA). A spatial database was constructed based on 159 fire events from the Hyrcanian ecoregion (Iran) for which a suite of predictor variables was derived. Each predictor variable was discretized into classes. The step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) procedure was used to assign weights to each class of each predictor variable. Weights indicate the strength of the spatial relationship between each class and fire occurrence and were used for training the hybrid models. The hybrid models were validated using several performance metrics and compared to the single ANFIS model. Although the single ANFIS model outperformed the hybrid models in the training phase, its accuracy decreased considerably in the validation phase. All hybrid models performed well for both training and validation datasets, but the ANFIS-ICA hybrid showed superior predictive performance of spatially explicit wildfire prediction and mapping for the dataset. The results clearly demonstrate the ability of the optimization algorithms to overcome the over-fitting problem of the single ANFIS model at the learning stage of the fire pattern. This study contributes to the suite of research that seeks to obtain reliable estimates of relative likelihoods of natural hazards.

AB  - Predictive modelling of mineral prospectivity using GIS is a valid and progressively more accepted tool for delineating reproducible mineral exploration targets. In this study, machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forest (RF), were employed to conduct GIS-based mineral prospectivity mapping of the Tongling ore district, eastern China. The mineral systems approach was used to translate our understanding of the skarn Cu mineral system into mappable exploration criteria, resulting in 12 predictor maps that represent source, transport, physical trap and chemical deposition processes critical for ore formation. Predictive SVM, ANN and RF models were trained by way of predictor maps, and corroborated using a 10-fold cross-validation. The overall performance of the resulting predictive models was assessed in both training and test datasets using a confusion matrix, set of statistical measurements, receiver operating characteristic curve, and success-rate curve. The assessment results indicate that the three machine learning models presented in this study achieved satisfactory performance levels characterized by high predictive accuracy. In addition, all models exhibited well interpretability that provided consistent ranking information about the relative importance of the evidential features contributing to the final predictions. In comparison, the RF model outperformed the SVM and ANN models, having achieved greater consistency with respect to variations in the model parameters and better predictive accuracy. Importantly, the RF model exhibited the highest predictive efficiency capturing most of the known deposits within the smallest prospective tracts. The above results suggest that the RF model is the most appropriate model for Cu potential mapping in the Tongling ore district, and, therefore, was used to generate a prospectivity map containing very-high, high, moderate, and low potential areas in support of follow-up exploration. The prospective areas delineated in this map occupy 13.97% of the study area and capture 80.95% of the known deposits. The fact that two newly discovered deposits occur within the prospective areas predicted by the prospectivity model indicates that the model is robust and effective regarding exploration target generation.

AB  - In the business environment, decision making is a differential when the team responsible for it does it right. This implies some assumptions, such as knowledge of the activity, internal and external variables that impact the company’s business, as well as the quality of the workforce. Thus, when the maintenance issue is addressed, be it in industrial or service companies, the expected results will be translated by the satisfaction indexes of its users. This work aims to propose a framework with the elements that lead to the proper decision making in maintenance for bus companies. For this, the multicriteria decision-making method chosen was PROMETHEE. The PROMETHEE method has the flexibility to treat data both qualitatively and quantitatively, offering different scenarios to managers on the best decision to make. It is known that companies seek to minimize their maintenance costs and maximize the quality of service provided.

AB  - Efficient and reliable maintainability management is a basic element behind ensuring sustainable practices for offshore assets. A method for easily implementing offshore asset maintainability management is proposed and described in terms of the maintainability decision-making process based on data-mining technology. A dataset of historical logs from operational systems drawn from offshore oil and gas service firms that have adopted sustainable maintenance management information system practices, including 12 main systems and 91 auxiliary systems, is used to inform a case study describing maintainability management and the decision-making process. The method uses the optimal values from a multicore classification model that adopts a goal-oriented data mining decision-making approach. Based on maintenance feature attributes, fault duration, fault loss, and frequency of occurrence in maintenance management are the three most important predictors of decision objectives. The decision tree classification results also indicate that the total average maintainability of assets in the key assets component is 53.4%, and the total average maintainability of noncritical assets is 37.9%. The five most important characteristic events found during maintenance and configuration processes were flaws in the tubing for A-annulus communication, leakage in the closed position, external leakage, failure to close on demand, and hydraulic failures that cause safety loss. The results provide unique insights into how offshore enterprise operators can improve maintainability management and decision-making performance using a data-driven decision strategy perspective. Furthermore, it provides a solution for visual proactive maintenance management and decision making under a data-driven framework, making it easier to implement maintenance management and decision-making tasks.

AB  - The growing role of sustainability in the construction industry must be considered in the entire lifecycle of a building. This way BIM (Building Information Modeling) figures as an important factor in the management of this lifecycle, from design and construction, through the operation and maintenance until the demolition. An efficient interoperability along the lifecycle supported by BIM allows an overall better management and help users to improve sustainability of projects. This interoperability must consider not only data, but also should be concerned with broader aspects, such as processes and guidelines, avoiding information loss, facilitating analysis, and therefore, improving sustainability. In the light of this scenario, a systematic literature review was performed considering sustainability factors, interoperability concerns and lifecycle stages. This review was based on existing methods complemented by a multicriteria decision analysis method to aid the selection of relevant papers. Also, a qualitative data analysis was performed to identify the relations of the fields studied. Results showed that even though some fields receive much attention in the literature, few studies are performed considering interoperability in the entire lifecycle of sustainable buildings. Also, results showed the relevant connections among lifecycle stages and sustainability fields, providing an influence matrix of these two areas. This review can be used as a tool to organize knowledge and data and systematize processes and even to structure interoperability frameworks.

AB  - We address the problem of how to define an importance index in multicriteria decision problems, when a numerical representation of preferences is given. We make no restrictive assumption on the model, which could have discrete or continuous attributes, and in particular, it is not assumed that the model is monotonically increasing or decreasing with respect to the attributes. Our analysis first considers discrete models, which are seen to be equivalent to multichoice games. We propose essentially two importance indices, namely the signed importance index and the absolute importance index, both based on the average variation of the value of the model induced by a given attribute. We provide several axiomatizations for these importance indices, extend them to the continuous case, and finally illustrate them with examples: classical simple models and an example of discomfort evaluation based on real data.

AB  - A supply chain performance prediction system aims to estimate lagging metrics based on leading metrics so as to predict performance based on causal relationships. Two studies in the literature propose a supply chain performance prediction system based on metrics suggested by the SCOR® (Supply Chain Operations Reference) model. However, a limitation of both systems is the difficulty of adjusting them to the environment of use, since their implementation and updating require manual parameterization of many fuzzy decision rules. To overcome this difficulty, this study proposes a performance prediction system also based on the SCOR® metrics but using artificial neural networks (ANN), which enables adaptation to a specific environment by means of historical performance data. Computational implementation of the ANN models was made using MATLAB. The method of random subsampling cross-validation was applied to select the network topologies. Results showed that the values of the correlation coefficient evidence that there is a high positive correlation between the expected and predicted performance values for the SCOR® level 1 metrics by all the ANN models. Statistical hypothesis tests showed that multilayer perceptron neural networks are adequate to support performance prediction of supply chains based on the SCOR® model. The proposed system promotes rational decision-making through a prospective diagnosis of the supply chain performance. By comparison between the predicted value and the target defined for each level 1 metric, managers can simulate whether improvement plans can lead to objectives; it can also help to identify areas that have performance problems and may need improvements.

AB  - Forest parameters have been estimated using various regression methods based on satellite data. However, there are a few concerns regarding further application of these predicted parameters. Current forest quality (FQ) assessments are mainly based on forest parameters collected in the field. To evaluate FQ quickly and comprehensively, forest parameters estimated from satellite images can be used. Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) plantations have experienced increases in tree mortality and reductions in tree growth caused by human destruction and poor natural conditions on the Loess Plateau. Assessing the FQ of the black locust plantations in these areas is critical. In this study, four machine learning algorithms (MLAs) – classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) – were first implemented and compared regarding their ability to estimate forest parameters of black locust plantations on the Loess Plateau. The results indicated that among the four MLAs, the CART method achieved the lowest accuracy, the SVM and ANN methods had moderate performances, and the RF obtained the highest accuracy and lowest error for all forest parameter estimates. As a result, the RF algorithm was chosen to predict the forest parameters. The highest R2 values among the forest parameters were predicted for the diameter at breast height (DBH, R2 = 0.85 and relative root mean square error (rRMSE) = 0.18), and the lowest R2 values were predicted for the forest aboveground biomass (AGB, R2 = 0.66 and rRMSE = 0.25). These predicted forest parameters as well as the topographic factors derived from a digital elevation model (DEM) were used to assess the FQ of the study area. Among the four stand age classes, the middle-aged forest had the lowest proportion of poor quality forests (7%) and the highest proportion of good quality forests (52%), whereas overmature forests presented a moderate proportion of poor quality forests (23%) and good quality forests (21%). These results provide the necessary foundation for forest management and guidance for regional reforestation on the Loess Plateau.

AB  - The integration of Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study with the Decision-Matrix Risk Assessment (DMRA) technique and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) as well, is proposed as a new framework for identifying critical points and potential hazards and also prioritizing risks, in industry. Therefore, the objective of this article is the development and application of the extended HAZOP-DMRA-AHP approach (E-HAZOP) in process industries. Initially, the application of the conventional HAZOP study is performed (as a case study) in a sour crude-oil processing-plant in order to identify the possible fault causes of abnormal conditions (deviations) in the plant. With the results of the HAZOP study on the one hand, and the usage of the DMRA risk assessment technique for assessing the risks, on the other side, the typical AHP process is then introduced, in order to extend HAZOP analysis by prioritizing the risks in the worksite of the plant. The proposed E-HAZOP framework can provide a trustworthy basis to boost process safety and improve occupational health and safety. Moreover, it could be a useful tool for the decision makers to estimate the emergency of investing constrained budget in actions preventing specific kind of deviations.

AB  - There is a growing demand for species-based conservation to be strategic and deliver the greatest possible benefits for the money and resources invested. There is no global consensus on what constitutes an important species, but many biodiversity conservation initiatives prioritise the most rare, unique, vulnerable and/or useful as deserving attention. Currently, a wide range of prioritisation methods using varied criteria are available, but it can be difficult for conservation managers to choose the appropriate protocol best suited to their conservation purposes, and to combine the protocols that are available. The prioritisation process proposed here is integrative, adaptable, straightforward and transparent, and open to refinement by interested parties. Based on the availability of taxon level data, from an initial list of 337,137 accepted scientific names, we produced a conservation priority list for 25,025 vascular plant taxa (pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms) that accounts for their geographic rarity or endemism, taxonomic rarity or uniqueness, vulnerability to extinction and natural capital value by means of a multicriteria decision making approach. This list represents about 4.47% of pteridophyte, 36.12% of gymnosperm and 7.41% of angiosperm global diversity. The list consisted of a high percentage of taxa from South America (30%), Africa (23%) and North America (22%) followed by Asia-Temperate and Europe (each 15%) and Asia-Tropical (14%) with a low percentage from Australasia (6%), the Pacific (5%) and Antarctic (~2%). The occurrence of some taxa was reported from more than one geographic continent. We found 573 taxa (2%) had a high priority status, 21,707 taxa (87%) had a medium priority status and 2745 taxa (11%) had a low priority status for conservation. Results were validated against existing prioritisation schemes with a global or continental focus. The resulting list of plants with priority status along with their geographical distribution patterns should complement, not replace, existing conservation plans. Our method can be used as a rapid and preliminary assessment technique in prioritising vascular plants and has the scope to be used globally across various conservation activities.

In this work an extensive review on the DSSs applied to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is presented. The main aim of the work is to provide an updated compendium on DSSs in view of supporting researchers and engineers on the selection of the most suitable method to address their management/operation/design problems. Results showed that DSSs were mostly used as a comprehensive tool that is capable of integrating several data and a multi-criteria perspective in order to provide more reliable results. Only one energy-focused DSS was found in literature, while DSSs based on quality and operational issues are very often applied to site-specific conditions. Finally, it would be important to encourage the development of more user-friendly DSSs to increase general interest and usability.

Electric power cannot be stocked in large quantity that why its production must be equal to the consumption in each time. This equation constituted the key for a good management of any power system and introduces the need of more controllers when taking into account the integration of renewable energy sources into the traditional power system. More controllers are presented in the literature and the presents work proposes a review of those called traditional and those who combined the traditional controller and artificial intelligence algorithms.

AB  - Contaminated sediment may pose a serious threat to human health and ecosystems. However, sediment remediation is typically an expensive and time-consuming process. Therefore, an effective decision-making process for the remediation of contaminated sediment is essential for identifying the optimal approach. Since a single assessment for sediment remediation may be insufficient, combining different analytical approaches is highly recommended. The objective of this study was to develop a comprehensive assessment framework based on the concept of green and sustainable remediation that considers various environmental, economic, and social aspects for the management of contaminated sediment. We propose a framework based on human health risk assessment (HHRA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and apply the multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique to implement integrated and sustainable strategies for sediment management. We used the framework to determine the best alternative for managing heavy-metal-contaminated sediment in a river in Northern Taiwan. The results of the pre-remediation HHRA indicated an unacceptably high cancer risk to children, while the CBA revealed that a remediation project was economically feasible. Moreover, the results of the MCDA revealed that a strategy involving in-situ capping with anthracite-based activated carbon would be relatively inexpensive and result in low risk to human health. In addition, this strategy would have a higher environmental impact and greater public acceptance as compared to a method involving the dredging and washing of soil. Thus, in this case study, in-situ capping using anthracite-based activated carbon was identified as the preferable remediation alternative from multiple perspectives. The proposed framework should allow decision-makers to choose the optimal integrated management strategy for similar river sites with contaminated sediment.

AB  - In early stage of building design, design team has to consider and simulate energy consumption for several combinations of various input parameters to analyze the building energy consumption. In a scenario considering five parameters, each with ten variations, one has to simulate hundred thousand combinations. It requires a lot of computation to simulate energy consumption for all the input combinations. This paper aims at reducing the computation required to compute the energy consumption of all the combinations. This is done by identifying appropriate training samples, computing their energy consumption using EnergyPlus and estimating energy consumption of the rest of the data using machine learning techniques. This paper presents two sampling methods along with various regression techniques to predict energy consumption of a building in the early phase. It involves usage of efficient sampling methods for identifying the training data. The key contribution of this method of surrogate modeling is saving a lot of computation by reducing the computation by ~100-fold. This method is tested for Jaipur and Hyderabad cities of India. Approximately hundred thousand simulations are performed for each location using parallel computation. By simulating approximately one percent of the input combinations, annual energy consumption for the large set of combinations are predicted using SVR and k-means clustering for Jaipur with accuracy greater than 93% for 99.8% of the input combinations. When the same model is trained for Hyderabad, it produced accuracy greater than 93% for 98% of the input combinations.

Parametrisation of online campaigns is usually related to allocation of budgets, number of seeds and strategies of their selection. It is hard to predict campaign effects. Proposed in this paper approach uses network samples to select appropriate strategy for use within complete network. Results showed how scaling of samples is affecting approximation quality. Multi-criteria analysis of performance allows for strategy selection according to preferences and goals.

AB  - Flash floods are among the most devastating natural hazards but the analyses of flash floods are hindered by the lack of hydro-meteorological data. In particular, data issues are critical in ungauged basins. This paper presents an investigation of flash flood modeling using coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models. Specifically, the TOPography-based hydrological MODEL (TOPMODEL) is employed to obtain the flood hydrograph and the coupled 1D-2D hydrodynamic model MIKEFLOOD is used to simulate floodplain inundation. The methods are tested in the Pajiang River, a mountainous basin in South China. The results show that the TOPMODEL effectively simulates the flood hydrograph and the Nash–Sutcliffe coefficients of the flow rate are larger than 0.80 for both calibration and validation. Also, MIKEFLOOD effectively simulates the flood inundation extent and flooding depth and the BIAS for simulated water level is −0.004 m. Further, using socioeconomic and historical flood disaster datasets, areas with high flash flood risk are identified. A flash flood risk assessment shows a clear trend of change in the flood hazard and the spatial heterogeneity of the flood vulnerability is significant. A sensitivity analysis of the flood vulnerability to the socioeconomic indicators indicates that cultivated land is the most sensitive indicators, and the population and the construction areas have similar influences. Overall, the coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models prove effective and can be used in practical applications for flash flood risk mapping.

The system is composed by: (i) a “sea-to-grid” technological component harvesting and producing electrical energy from sea waves; (ii) a “green” logistic services based on the use of EVs. This paper is relative to part (ii). One of the main challenge is to promote the use of green-energy resources for freight and people mobility planning involved in the port area. The main task concerns the location of a parking area/distribution center and the optimal design of mobility services, operated by means of EVs, connecting a port with a closer extended (sub)urban area. The mobility services by EV bikes and cars are oriented to the port users; the freight services are oriented to the extended port area. In this context, the paper presents a methodology for the definition of freight logistics and passenger transport services in order to pursue sustainability goals, and a data analysis in the pilot study of Roccella Jonica port, South of Italy.

AB  - The purpose of this research was forest fire susceptibility mapping in the western part of the Republic of Serbia. A forest fire inventory map was developed using a serial historical forest fire database, Worldview-2, Landsat 8 OLI, MODIS, and field recording. The proposed methodology is based on the combined application of geographical information system and multicriteria decision analysis. The methodology considers 13 conditioning factors for forest fire susceptibility mapping. These are altitude, slope degree, aspect, plan curvature, topographic wetness index, average annual rainfall, wind power, average annual temperature, distance from river, soil type, normalized difference vegetation index, distance from road, and distance from urban areas. The expert evaluation takes into account the nature and severity of observed criteria, and it is tested using three modalities of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The first of these uses the interval rough numbers with the analytical hierarchy process (IR’AHP). The second uses the fuzzy technique for the exploitation of uncertainty with the AHP method [fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP)], and the third scenario uses the traditional (crisp) AHP method. The final maps of forest fire by different scenarios were prepared using the weighted linear combination algorithm. For accuracy of results, a receiver operating characteristics curve and the kappa coefficient (kappa) were applied. According to the validation of results using the area under the curve and kappa coefficient, the final map obtained from the IR’AHP model was the most accurate compared to the FAHP and AHP models. In addition, based on the obtained accuracy assessment results, all models had most satisfactory performance and could be utilized for forest fire susceptibility mapping in the study area.

AB  - It all starts with the forest; a rich, complex, but also fragile ecosystem. Managing such a complicated ecosystem is a challenging task, especially in mountainous regions. The complexity in these regions arises from variable topographic conditions, while the difficulty is finding a solution for multiple, sometimes conflicting, objectives, which requires that many sources of information are incorporated into the decision. These normally involve large volumes of data and analyses, which have been mostly carried out manually in most countries. As a result, the effectiveness and efficiencies of the decisions implemented are limited. To overcome difficulties, the current study firstly reviewed the most often used geospatial multicriteria decision system capabilities of Geographical Information System and R platform, and secondly, introduced the development of an integrative approach that combined spatial analysis with a multicriteria decision system to find feasible zones in which harvest operations can be conducted, and locate logistics possibilities for ground-based skidding operations in a subjective way without including monetary assessments. According to the harvest feasibility map, 50.82% of the total area is identified as feasible zones for the planning of timber harvest operations, of which 68.30% are allocated to the use of mechanized harvesting systems. The animal system is the preferred system on 32.24% of the total area characterized by steep-slope zones. The method also identified 55 sites with a variable area as suitable zones for a wood-yard terminal, of which 33 sites are nominated and evaluated using a compromise programming approach. The study ends with some discussions and concluding remarks.

AB  - In the present study, landslide susceptibility assessment for a part of the North Anatolian Fault Zone between Reşadiye and Koyulhisar townships has been determined using index of entropy (IOE) and frequency ratio (FR) models within geographical information system. The landslide inventory map has been created in the study area. Altogether 91 landslides were mapped and 63 (69%) were randomly selected for modelling, with the remainder (28, 31%) used for validating the models. The landslide-conditioning factors, including slope degree, aspect, elevation, distance to faults, distance to streams, distance to road were selected. Subsequently, landslide susceptibility maps were produced using frequency ratio and index of entropy models. For verification, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn and the areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated. The verification results showed that FR model (AUC = 75.71%) provided slightly better predictions than the IOE (AUC = 75.43%) model. According to the FR, about 32.54% of the study area is located within high to very high susceptibility classes of landslides. The interpretation of the susceptibility map indicates that distance to streams, distance to road and distance to fault play major roles in landslide occurrence and distribution in the study area. The landslide susceptibility maps like the one produced in this study should provide a valuable tool for the use of planners and engineers for reorganizing or planning new road and domestic constructions.

AB  - Hot-dip galvanizing is considered one of the most important corrosion protection alternatives for steel; however, its poor environmental performance has been a matter of concern. Even though many researchers have dealt with this topic in the past none of them have jointly dealt with the triple bottom line of sustainable development, and with the random and epistemic uncertainty of its measurement. For that reason, in this work, the sustainability of the hot-dip galvanizing process is investigated integrating: (a) 17 indicators taken from the 4 categories of the GREENSCOPE methodology and one quality performance indicator which is directly related to ISO 1461. (b) The additive utility method for multi-criteria decision-making. (c) The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process used to calculate the relative weights of both indicators and categories by means of a survey. (d) The hierarchical partitioning analysis used for determining the process stages that have a higher impact on sustainability variation, and others useful and suitable statistical tools for data analysis. Furthermore, the proposed framework is tested for a particular hot-dip galvanizing process, considering a random generation of each batch size, steel item characteristics and operating conditions via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. The results show that the stages of pickling and fluxing are critical for the analyzed system and they are not expected to be improved without a significant modification of the process. The proposal outlined in this paper might help designers, process engineers and researchers for a better decision-making process, focusing on the most critical stages while considering the trade-off between the three dimensions of sustainable development.

Furthermore, lack of a systematic and computer-based model for showing the steps of budget allocation and algorithmic models, as well as a model to support the qualitative sections, has led to failure of the system. This chapter paves the way for finding a sophisticated platform in an attempt to develop a decision support system with a multiobjective programming model for an efficient allocation in the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education.

AB  - Diversity multi-criteria decision-making methods have been developed to address different complex decision-making problems, and the analytic network process has been found to be one of the most effective techniques. There is an increase in the quality and quantity of publications related to the analytic network process. This detailed overview can provide the research status and development characteristics of analytic network process research and will be useful to researchers for future research directions. To achieve these goals, bibliometric techniques were used. In addition, past and present hotspots of analytic network process research were concluded, and future research trends were determined. The bibliometric analysis was carried out from various aspects including countries and regions, institutions, journals, authors, research areas, articles and author keywords based on data harvested from the Web of Science database. There were 1485 analytic network process-related publications retrieved from the Web of Science. The results show that Expert Systems with Applications was the most productive journal publishing articles in analytic network process research (118); its number of publications has decreased dramatically since 2013, while Journal of Cleaner Production has shown an upward trend in recent years and ranks second with 47 publications. The most collaborative country is the United States. Taiwan takes a leading position in analytic network process research with 436 publications (29.36%), and National Chiao Tung University, which is located in Taiwan, produced the most articles and has gained the highest h-index (28). The major hot topics that employ analytic network process are sustainability, environmental management and supply chain management. These topics may continue to attract more attention in the future.

AB  - In the past decades, the quantity of researches regarding industrial gas turbines (GT) has increased exponentially in terms of number of publications and diversity of applications. The GTs offer high power output along with a high combined cycle efficiency and high fuel flexibility. As consequence, the energy efficiency, the pressure oscillations, the pollutant emissions and the fault diagnosis have become some of the recent concerns related to this type of equipment. In order to solve these GTs related problems and many other real-world engineering and industry 4.0 issues, a set of new technological approaches have been tested, such as the combination of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and metaheuristics for global optimization. In this paper, the recently proposed metaheuristic denoted Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA) is applied to the operation optimization of a heavy duty gas turbine placed in Brazil and used in power generation. The global goal is to find the best valves setup to reduce the fuel consumption while coping with environmental and physical constraints from its operation. In order to treat it as an optimization problem, an integrated simulation model is implemented from original data-driven models and others previously proposed in literature. Moreover, a new version of the COA that links some concepts from Cultural Algorithms (CA) is proposed, which is validated under a set of benchmarks functions from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2017 and tested to the GT problem. The results show that the proposed Cultural Coyote Optimization Algorithm (CCOA) outperforms its counterpart for benchmark functions. Further, non-parametric statistical significance tests prove that the CCOA’s performance is competitive when compared to other state-of-the-art metaheuristics after a set of experiments for five case studies. In addition, the convergence analysis shows that the cultural mechanism employed in the CCOA has improved the COA balance between exploration and exploitation. As a result, the CCOA can improve the current GT operation significantly, reducing the fuel consumption up to 3.6% meanwhile all constraints are accomplished.

AB  - Sustainable treatments of construction and demolition (C&D) wastes have become an increasingly urgent social, environmental, and economic issue worldwide. Based on a filter of 370 articles related to C&D waste management, this review-based study adopted a science mapping approach to evaluating the recent decade’s C&D waste management research. Through a three-step workflow consisting of bibliometric literature search, scientometric analysis, and qualitative discussion, this study identified the most influential journals, scholars, articles, and countries that have been active and influential in the C&D waste management research since 2009. Keyword analysis revealed the emerging research topics, such as BIM, prefabricated construction, Big Data, and Circular Economy. The follow-up discussion summarized the mainstream research areas (e.g., qualification of waste generation), discussed research gaps (e.g., integration of BIM and Big Data into C&D waste management), and proposed the framework for near-future research, such as a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of C&D waste diversion, human factors, and design and planning for waste diversion. By providing the big picture of the latest research in C&D waste management since 2009, the paper serves as a multi-disciplinary guide for practitioners and researchers to link current research areas into future trends.

The choice to emphasize the application of Digital Twin is due to the fact that it is a digital replica, a virtual version of a system, helping companies to develop, improve and evaluate their products, optimizing the process, improving production, reducing costs and helping the improvement of the final product. This article presents a bibliometric analysis of the subjects related to Digital Manufacturing, focusing on the application of Digital Twin and also researches involving systems monitoring with the transfer of information in real time. For the construction of knowledge, the realization of this research was chosen using the ProKnow-C method (Knowledge Development Process) assisting the author in the theoretical basis of the subject in question. The development of this method consists of the first moment in the selection of the articles to form a bibliographic portfolio, searching for publications by keywords relevant to the research; later the bibliographic analysis of these articles found in databases respected, quantitatively evaluating those of greater relevance, as well as recurrent authors and periodicals, focused on the subject; in a third moment the practice of a systematic analysis of this portfolio is important, raising more recurring problems, possible proposed solutions and existing gaps in this area so that; in the end it is possible to define the research question as well as the general and specific objectives forming the knowledge base on the topic addressed. This article presents a survey on the subject in question, demonstrating research involving real-time monitoring with the use of sensors and actuators, as well as emphasizing in Industry 4.0 with Internet of Things (IoT) mechanism and cyber-physical systems. Works seeking the improvement of these systems, as well as the use of data analytics to improve the virtual model generated by Digital Twin, show a great tendency for future research.

AB  - Spatial analysis approaches have been long since adopted in citation studies. For instance, already in the early eighties, two works relied on input-output matrices to delve into citation transactions among journals (Noma, 1982; Price, 1981). However, the techniques meant to analyze spatial data have evolved since then, experiencing a major step change starting from the turn of the century or so. Here I aim to show that citation analysis may benefit from the development and latest improvements of spatial data analysis, primarily by borrowing the spatial autoregressive models commonly used to identify the occurrence of the so-called peer and neighborhood effects. I discuss features and potentialities of the suggested method using an Italian narrow academic sector as a test bed. The approach proves itself useful for identifying possible citation behavior and patterns. Especially, I delve into the relationships between citation frequency at author level and years of activity, references, references used by the closest peers, self-citations, number of co-authors, conference papers, and conference papers authored by the nearby researchers.

AB  - Ontologies are one of the fundamental elements of the Semantic Web, and they have gained a lot of popularity and recognition because they are viewed as the answer to the need for interoperable semantics in modern information systems. The intermingling of techniques in areas such as natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning, data mining, and knowledge representation provide a lot of possibilities for development of ontology learning approaches. A rise in focus on the ability to cope with the scale of Web data required for ontology learning forces the potential growth of cross-language research, emphasizing the automatic or semi-automatic generation of the tools dedicated to text mining and information extraction. This paper presents the integration of ontology learning tools from text in the knowledge repository to incorporate the applied techniques and outputs of an ontology learning algorithm into the one complex multifunctional solution. The proposed knowledge repository covers various applicability of existing techniques of learning ontologies from text, and offers competency question-based reasoning mechanism for individuals to specify their profiles of ontology learning tools. The validation stage is also provided in the form of applied reasoning.

AB  - Background
We have seen significant advancement in a range of health technologies, some with transformative or curative potential. Nevertheless, it is often unclear how global health systems recognize or reward innovation.
Objectives
To consider what is transformative, challenges for transformative therapies, and downstream health ecosystem effects.
Methods
A systematic review of publications in English between 2012 and 2018 was conducted with a focus on value assessment processes and health system effects of a range of breakthrough health technology categories. After screening 9012 records, 222 unique studies were identified. The study also included an analysis of 100 health technology assessments (HTAs) from 5 markets to consider how and in what ways global HTA bodies evaluate transformative therapies. Global sales and technology/procedure utilization data were also evaluated to gain insights into patient access and commercial impact.
Results
This article evaluated uncertainties around evidence of efficacy, safety, and duration of effect, as well as underlying study quality and methodological considerations in the target categories. Although many HTA evaluations had similar approaches to assessing parameters such as safety, there were significant differences across technology categories. Technology-driven trends also surfaced where global HTA and payer systems may not yet be prepared to recognize and reward emerging technology impacts, including use of next-generation diagnostic results to guide care, considering novel impacts on therapy sequencing and clinical pathway management, and changes in payment and health delivery models.
Conclusions
Some trends stemming from rapid evolution of breakthrough therapies will prompt reconsideration of our conventional value assessment and reward models, because health system measurement and management processes have not fully anticipated their effects.

AB  - Background
Mechanically ventilated patients with respiratory disorders may require sedatives, such as opioids.
Objectives
To define methodological trends, gaps, and the reporting quality of the comparative clinical and economic evaluations of fentanyl and morphine in ventilated patients in the intensive care unit.
Methods
We conducted a literature review of the MEDLINE, Embase, OVID, ScienceDirect, Springer Link, and EconLit databases, comparing studies in the management of ventilated patients with respiratory disorders in the intensive care unit using either fentanyl or morphine, or both. We assessed the methodological aspects of the literature characteristics and trends of, for example, modeling, data sources, cost calculation, and data analysis, appraising the quality of reporting via the CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials, STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology, and the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklists.
Results
Among 1327 articles, 33 (comprising 22 in adults, 8 in neonates, and 3 in pediatrics) met the inclusion criteria. No head-to-head morphine versus fentanyl evaluations explicitly confined to subjects with respiratory conditions were undertaken. Studies relied on various scales to measure the sedation level as a primary study outcome, limiting the comparability of study conclusions. Seven articles of adults were identified to be economic studies from the hospital perspective. On the basis of different endpoints, the same sedation regimen performed differently in various studies. None of the randomized controlled trials, observational cohorts, or pharmacoeconomics studies met most of the assessed reporting quality criteria.
Conclusions
Our review identified poor reporting quality and high heterogeneity of methods used, potentially limiting the degree to which studies could be interpreted, decisions could be influenced, and findings could be generalized.

AB  - Industry and academia shift from the single cloud provider paradigm to cloud federations and alternative models, which orchestrate heterogeneous resources, such as Mobile Edge Computing and Fog Computing. In such complex environments, incorrect selection of deployment platform can lead to underwhelming application performance. This dictates the necessity of Service Level Agreements (SLA) and trust management services in order to enforce performance guarantees and enable customers to simultaneously evaluate their application’s performance and give performance indicators for future provider selection. In this paper, we propose a collaborative SLA and Reputation-based Trust Management (RTM) solution for federated cloud environment. The SLA service defines clearly the performance metrics and measures the actual performance of the deployed cloud applications. Based on the SLA, the RTM service of the collaborative solution leverages several technical and user’s experience metrics to compute the reliability of the cloud providers and the credibility of the customers. A proof of concept of the collaborative solution in a realistic federated environment is provided and validated. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that it objectively computes the cloud providers’ reputation values under various scenarios.

AB  - Today, almost everybody has a smartphone and applications have been developed to help users to take decisions (e.g. which hotel to choose, which museum to visit, etc). In order to improve the recommendations of the mobile application, it is crucial to elicit the preference structures of the user. As problems are often based on several criteria, multicriteria decision aiding methods are most adequate in these cases, and past works have proposed indirect eliciting approaches for multicriteria decision aiding methods. However, they often do not aim of reducing as much as possible the cognitive efforts required by the user. This is prerequisite of mobile applications as they are used by everybody. In this work, the weights to assign to the evaluation criteria in a PROMETHEE-based ranking approach are unknown, and therefore must be elicited indirectly either from a partial ranking provided by the user or from the selection of his/her most preferred alternative into a subset of reference alternatives. In the latter case, the cognitive effort required by the decision-maker is minimal. Starting from a linear optimisation model aimed at searching for the most discriminating vector of weights, three quadratic variants are proposed subsequently to overcome the issues arising from the linear model. An iterative quadratic optimisation model is proposed to fit the real setting in which the application should operate, where the eliciting procedure must be launched iteratively and converge over time to the vector of weights, which are the weights that the user implicitly assigns to the evaluation criteria. Finally, three experiments are performed to confirm the effectiveness and the differences between the proposed models.

AB  - Nowadays, context aware manufacturing systems offer interesting capabilities to improve the performance of pull controlled production systems. Smart Kanbans can be used instead of physical cards, and the information become available about the production context, collected for example through sensors and RFID. Such information can be exploited by intelligent pull control strategies so as to dynamically adapt the number of cards. This is particularly useful for production systems that are subjected to unpredictable changes in the customers’ demand, and need to react quickly to preserve a high level of performance. For this reason, we aim, in this article, at proposing an intelligent system, which can communicate with the information system, whose purpose is to autonomously decide or to help managers in adding or removing cards. In this respect, we propose an approach that uses a neural network which is trained offline, directly from simulation, to decide when it is relevant to change the number of cards, and at what production stage. The learning process, based on multi-objective simulation optimization, aims at reducing the production costs as well as the number of changes to avoid nervousness. The use of stochastic simulation, allows various types of complex problems, related to manufacturing systems, to be addressed and fluctuating demand phenomena to be taken into account. The relevance of our approach is illustrated using six published adaptive ConWIP and Kanban systems. Comparisons with adaptive Kanban and ConWIP systems show that the neural network can automatically learn very relevant knowledge. Good results are obtained in terms of performance, with fewer changes in the number of cards. Several possible future research directions are pointed out.

AB  - As the water quality of rivers and lakes is central to human and economic development, the accurate evaluation and estimation of water quality levels has become essential. Water quality assessment is the foundation of environmental protection work and is an important part of water environmental supervision and management. It refers to water quality evaluation through physical, chemical, and biological indicators, based on water quality monitoring (WQM) data, according to certain evaluation standards and evaluation methods. In order to accurately reflect the current state of water quality, both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of water quality factors are needed, with the goal of understanding the degree of influence and the developmental trends of water pollution, in order to protect the water environment and provide a scientific basis for water resources planning management. The core of water quality evaluation is the selection of an evaluation method. The rationality of the evaluation method determines whether the result of the water quality evaluation is reliable. This chapter discusses the various methods of water quality evaluation used and compare them in terms of their suitability for this application. Methods examined are decision-making methods, index evaluation methods, and artificial intelligence evaluation methods. Several practical applications are also examined.

The most important task of any website is the provision of tailored information and services to satisfy client needs. This research aimed to evaluate the status of websites and e-services provided by five-star hotels. For this purpose, initial criteria and subcriteria for evaluation were determined using the fuzzy Delphi method. The weight of the criteria was calculated using the Shannon entropy method. Finally, PROMETHEE and GAIA methods were utilised to rank and develop the visual aid of websites. Once these perceptions were captured, amongst the four criteria determined for the evaluation of websites of hotels, customer orientation was the most important criterion, followed by marketing, security and technology. Moreover, the websites of the five-star hotels of Mashhad were evaluated and ranked to validate the proposed model.

AB  - Brownfield assessment is a crucial precondition for sustainable urban renewal. In particular, brownfield assessment usually involve a large amount of data and information relevant to urban or land dynamic. However, obtaining these data and information in fine scale has been especially challenging via traditional datasets (like surveyed or statistics datasets). This paper proposes a method for integrating crowdsourced datasets and traditional datasets to measure dynamic information of land parcels and applies a presence and background data machine learning (PBL) model to assess the redevelopment suitability in mass. The work focuses on the study area of Shenzhen, a high-density urban context with an adequate amount of urban renewal cases and sufficient crowdsourced data. Results indicated that assessments based on the combination of crowdsourced datasets and traditional datasets were accurate and reliable for the residential and commercial land parcels. Furthermore, mass assessments at a fine spatial-temporal scale are viable if introduce crowdsourced datasets due to the cost of obtaining the crowdsourced data is much lower, and the spatial-temporal scale is much finer than investigated or surveyed data.

AB  - Design optimization of geared transmissions has become more of a necessity than ever before. Typically, conflicting design goals must be concurrently achieved. The difficulty of such a multiobjective design optimization problem is exacerbated by the fact that modern design practices rely on increasingly sophisticated, computationally-expensive simulation tools for tooth contact analysis. Their intrinsic nonlinearities add complexity to the problem, hampering gear designers’ efforts to obtain globally optimal solutions. Practical optimization problems of this class have often been solved by evolutionary algorithms, but their computational burden may well be inappropriate for CPU-intensive simulation models. The present work details an algorithmic framework inspired by deterministic multiobjective optimization methods, specially combined with a direct-search global optimization algorithm to obtain globally Pareto-optimal solutions. Nonlinear constraints are enforced through an exact penalty formulation. A comprehensive description of all theoretical and algorithmic details is provided, with the intention of enabling gear designers to implement or adapt the proposed methodology to their design optimization purposes. Two tests on a challenging gear design problem, namely ease-off topography optimization of a hypoid gear set for maximum efficiency and minimum contact stress, demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently obtain solutions belonging to the global Pareto front. Declarations of interest: none.

AB  - Food safety is vital to the national economy and livelihood of people. Therefore, effective food safety warnings are helpful to the healthy and sustainable development of society. Focused on the early warning modeling for a certain scale of complex food safety inspection data, this paper proposes a novel early warning modeling method based on the deep radial basis function (DRBF) neural network that integrates an analytic hierarchy process (AHP). First, the AHP based on the entropy weight is used to obtain the risk fusion results of the inspection data as the expected output of the DRBF. Then, the DRBF model based on the autoencoder is used to build the early warning model, implementing feature learning to acquire the high-level representation of the food inspection data. Finally, the category data of sterilized milk from the food safety inspection data of a province in China is taken as a case study. Comparing the experimental results of the radial basis function (RBF) neural network, the back propagation (BP) neural network and the improved multilayer BP, the proposed DRBF model is found to have a better generalization ability and a better generalization effect for the complex food safety inspection data. Furthermore, the proposed early warning model is used to predict and analyze the risk of the inspection data from early September 2014. The results could be helpful for relevant departments to carry out early warning work and provide a scientific basis for guidance, thereby promoting the improvement of the food quality and reducing food risks.

AB  - Ventilation heat recovery devices have been increasingly used in energy-efficient buildings. Many factors, such as the attributes of buildings and the economic conditions of decision makers, should be considered in the installation of ventilation heat recovery devices. Thus, decision makers experience a multicriteria decision-making problem. This study presented a method of combining Analytical Hierarchy Process with the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution to provide guidance in selecting ventilation heat recovery devices on the basis of the attributes of buildings and preferences of decision makers. By using residential house, small shop, and small public service center as examples, four types of ventilation heat recovery devices (total, plate sensible, integral heat pipe (R32), integral heat pipe (R717) heat exchangers) were recommended and sequenced under different background requirements through the proposed method. Results showed that the total heat exchanger obtained the highest recommended indicator value in small load application scenario, indicating its suitability. The proposed method can completely consider the attributes of buildings and psychological preferences of decision makers and combine the characteristics of different types of ventilation heat recovery devices. This approach provides scientific and reasonable recommended results in selecting heat recovery devices.

AB  - Background
An increasing awareness of the importance of health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) skills has been reported in Latin America. There is, however, no published study directly assessing perceived knowledge levels and knowledge gaps on specific HEOR topics among professionals and students in the region.
Objectives
To assess perceived HEOR knowledge levels and identify knowledge gaps in Latin America.
Methods
An online needs assessment survey was developed to quantify perceived HEOR knowledge levels and identify knowledge gaps. Members of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research in the Latin American region, regional chapters, and student chapter presidents were invited to participate in the survey. The survey, developed using the SurveyMonkey tool, was distributed to participants electronically. Data were extracted from the survey and analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics to summarize the survey respondents' demographic information, current and desired knowledge levels, and preferred method/format for delivery of educational training.
Results
Survey responses were collected from 106 participants. The largest knowledge gap was calculated for methods for integrating medication adherence and persistence in health economic evaluations (mean = 2.30 ± 1.48). The smallest knowledge gap was calculated for types of healthcare costs (mean = 1.01 ± 1.17). Most respondents (74% [n = 66]) preferred to receive educational materials related to HEOR topics through online learning and continuing education programs.
Conclusions
The knowledge gap assessment provided current knowledge gap perceptions among members of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research in Latin America. The survey data collected support a need for developing educational programs for topics with the highest perceived knowledge gap.

AB  - The management of solid waste and its impact on the environment has been a subject of study and revision in different aspects, from mathematical modeling to control, with the aim of proposing different alternatives that contribute to diminishing the adverse effects in the environment. In this regard, reverse logistics has become a key trend to balance economic development with environmental protection, as this approach allows the maximization of value and the sustainable use of products at the end of their life cycle. This approach has been applied in different sectors such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, food, among others, but still with great potential for study in the plastic industry given the impact of plastic products on the environment and the increasing pressures of consumers, government and environmental groups that propose new forms of operation and innovation in companies in the sector. The goal of this work is the identification of good practices and trends in the plastic products manufacturing industry, with respect to the recovery of plastic products through reverse logistics, both at the revision level of literature, as well as, from the use of an evaluation instrument among entrepreneurs of the sector, in order to provide a framework for diagnosis and continuous improvement in the development of good practices in reverse logistics for the industry.

AB  - Regional cooperation has become a new direction for China development. Indeed, carbon emission reduction is especially important to combat Climate change. In this paper, we use Direction Distance Function to estimate the overall carbon emission efficiency. We empirically estimate the spatial Moran'I and LISA cluster in China from 2005 to 2016. Our results show carbon emission efficiency presents the spatial pattern of gradually decreasing in “Eastern, Central, Western” and symmetrical distribution in “Southern, Central, Northern” of China. High efficiency spatial cluster areas mainly concentrate on the mid-east coastal provinces, which technical level and policies are better than those of the inland among the factors influencing carbo emission efficiency, energy structure, technology and urbanization have a significant impact. This paper will provide some scientific support to solve cooperation between province to combat carbon emission.

AB  - In the present paper, we demonstrate that the degree of orness, which measures the attitudes of decision-makers, does not decrease strictly with the fractile values when either the normal probability density function or its inverse form is used to generate the weights of ordered weighted averaging operators. As for the weights of ordered weighted averaging operators generated from either the exponential distribution and its inverse form, we prove the strict monotonicity of the orness function with respect to the distribution shape parameter. To solve the drawbacks of the probability-density-function-based weight generation approach, the present paper uses the interweaving method to adjust the probability-density-function-based weighting vector of an ordered weighted averaging operator based on the premise that the distribution shape parameter is excluded. This enhanced approach retains the preferences of decision-makers to the utmost when they change their attitudes toward objects. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of this novel paradigm for generating the weights of ordered weighted averaging operators are demonstrated with its promising application in a system for aggregating movie ratings.

KW  - GPGPU power and performance
AB  - It has been more than a decade since general porous applications targeted GPUs to benefit from the enormous processing power they offer. However, not all applications gain speedup running on GPUs. If an application does not have enough parallel computation to hide memory latency, running it on a GPU will degrade the performance compared to what it could achieve on a CPU. On the other hand, the efficiency that an application with high level of parallelism can achieve running on a GPU depends on how well the application’s memory and computational demands are balanced with a GPU’s resources. In this work we tackle the problem of finding a GPU configuration that performs well on a set of GPGPU applications. To achieve this, we propose two models as follows. First, we study the design space of 20 GPGPU applications and show that the relationship between the architectural parameters of the GPU and the power and performance of the application it runs can be learned by a Neural Network (NN). We propose application-specific NN-based predictors that train with 5% of the design space and predict the power and performance of the remaining 95% configurations (blind set). Although the models make accurate predictions, there exist few configurations that their power and performance are mispredicted. We propose a filtering heuristic that captures most of the predictions with large errors by marking only 5% of the configurations in the blind set as outliers. Using the models and the filtering heuristic, one will have the power and performance values for all configurations in the design space of an application. Searching the design space for a set of configurations that meet certain restrictions on the power and performance can be a tedious task as some applications have large design spaces. In the Second model, we propose to employ the Pareto Front multiobjective optimization technique to obtain a subset of the design space that run the application optimally in terms of power and performance. We show that the optimum configurations predicted by our model is very close to the actual optimum configurations. While this method gives the optimum configurations for each application, having a set of GPGPU applications, one may look for a configuration that performs well over all the applications. Therefore, we propose a method to find such a configuration with respect to different performance objectives.

AB  - Population growth increases the need for food and water, resulting in an increase in water demand around the world. Since groundwater is the main source of consumption in arid and semiarid regions, it is important to understand the groundwater processes in a given watershed. The objective of this study is to use the classification and regression trees (CARTs) algorithm to predict groundwater potential in a semiarid region, Firoozeh watershed, Iran. A total of 11 condition factors, including topographic wetness index, distance to river, slope percent, drainage density, aspect, elevation, land use, lithology, distance from fault, relative slope position (RSP), and topographic position index were employed. Model calibration and validation were conducted based on the random partition in the R software environment. To assess the accuracy of a diagnostic test, relative operating characteristic curve analysis was considered. Sensitivity analysis (SA) was also performed to assess the importance of groundwater conditioning factors. The validation results indicated that the area under the curve value for CART model was 88%. SA showed that the most sensitive factors are RSP, lithology, distance from fault, and distance to river. The findings of the current research can be helpful for decision-makers and managers for sustainable planning, irrigation, and town water supply purposes to achieve water demand goals.

Major advances have been made since the first metaheuristic was proposed and numerous new algorithms are still being proposed every day. There is no doubt that the studies in this field will continue to develop in the near future. However, there is an obvious demand to pick out the best performing metaheuristics that are expected to be permanent. In this survey, we distinguish fourteen new and outstanding metaheuristics that have been introduced for the last twenty years (between 2000 and 2020) other than the classical ones such as genetic, particle swarm, and tabu search. The metaheuristics are selected due to their efficient performance, high number of citations, specific evolutionary operators, interesting interaction mechanisms between individuals, parameter tuning/handling concepts, and stagnation prevention methods. After giving absolute foundations of the new generation metaheuristics, recent research trends, hybrid metaheuristics, the lack of theoretical foundations, open problems, advances in parallel metaheuristics and new research opportunities are investigated.

Luxury summer resorts represent an interesting setting for investigating job satisfaction (JS). Hotels in this end of the market face higher customer quality expectations and depend heavily, in order to fulfill these expectations, on a diversified force of seasonal employees. To investigate the key factors that drive overall JS of seasonal employees in summer luxury resorts a survey was conducted in a single setting. The Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire was combined with the MUlticriteria Satisfaction Analysis (MUSA), demonstrating that MUSA can be an effective decision making tool also in the area of human resource management. Principal component and confirmatory factor analyses revealed a four-factor structure of the MSQ construct: Empowerment, Task enrichment, HRM policies and Leadership qualities. Moreover, MUSA indicated that Empowerment was the critical factor of JS of seasonal employees.

AB  - Cassava has the potential to be a promising crop that can adapt to changing climatic conditions in Indonesia due to its low water requirement and drought tolerance. However, inappropriate land selection decisions limit cassava yields and increase production-related costs to farmers. As a root crop, yield prediction using vegetation indices and biophysical properties is essential to maximize the yield of cassava before harvesting. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to develop a yield prediction model based on suitable areas that assess with land suitability analysis (LSA). For LSA, the priority indicators were identified using a fuzzy expert system combined with a multicriteria decision method including ecological categories. Furthermore, the yield prediction method was developed using satellite remote sensing datasets. In this analysis, Sentinel-2 datasets were collected and analyzed in SNAP® and ArcGIS® environments. The multisource database of ecological criteria for cassava production was built using the fuzzy membership function. The results showed that 42.17% of the land area was highly suitable for cassava production. Then, in the highly suitable area, the yield prediction model was developed using the vegetation indices based on Sentinel-2 datasets with 10 m resolution for the accuracy assessment. The vegetation indices were used to predict cassava growth, biophysical condition, and phenology over the growing seasons. The NDVI, SAVI, IRECI, LAI, and fAPAR were used to develop the model for predicting cassava growth. The generated models were validated using regression analysis between observed and predicted yield. As the vegetation indices, NDVI showed higher accuracy in the yield prediction model (R2 = 0.62) compared to SAVI and IRECI. Meanwhile, LAI had a higher prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.70) than other biophysical properties, fAPAR. The combined model using NDVI, SAVI, IRECI, LAI, and fAPAR reported the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.77). The ground truth data were used for the evaluation of satellite remote sensing data in the comparison between the observed and predicted yields. This developed integrated model could be implemented for the management of land allocation and yield assessment in cassava production to ensure regional food security in Indonesia.

Past malware studies tend to investigate the novel approaches of preventing, detecting and responding to malware threats but little attention has been given to the area of risk assessment. This paper aims to fill that gap by presenting a risk assessment approach that evaluate the risk zone for an application. The permission-based approach is presented for evaluating and zoning the Android applications (EZADroid), based on risk assessment. The EZADroid applies the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a decision factor to calculate the risk value. A total of 5000 benign and 5000 malware applications were drawn from the AndroZoo and Drebin datasets for evaluation. Results showed that the EZADroid had achieved 89.82% accuracy rate in classifying the application into a different level of risk zones (i.e. very low, low, medium, and high).

AB  - Fuzzy measures model interactions between the inputs in aggregation problems. Their complexity grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the problem, and elicitation of fuzzy measure coefficients either from domain experts or from empirical data is a significant challenge. The notions of k-additivity and k-maxitivity simplify the fuzzy measures by limiting interactions to subsets of up to k elements, but neither reduces the complexity of monotonicity constraints. In this paper we explore various approaches to further reduce the complexity of learning fuzzy measures. We introduce the concept of k-interactivity, which reduces both the number of variables and constraints, and also the complexity of each constraint. The learning problem is set as a linear programming problem, and its numerical efficiency is illustrated on numerical experiments. The proposed methods allow efficient learning of fuzzy measures in up to 30 variables, which is significantly higher than using k-additive and k-maxitive fuzzy measures.

AB  - The increasing competition among industries has led to the emergence of numerous tools and methods to support decision making focused on assets maintenance in a company, since ensuring good maintenance is directly linked with greater reliability and uptime for equipment, reducing losses in production processes and consequently increasing profitability. This work aims to use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms - Bayesian Networks (BN) and attribute relevance analysis (ARA), implemented in the Weka® platform, to process a dataset of event logs failure of industrial machine components. The approach aims to use the conditional probability relations generated by the BN and the ranking of criteria relevance for the design of an AHP decision-making model within the scope of industrial maintenance to prioritize which components of a specific machine are more susceptible to failures. The proposed integration mechanism aims to bring greater reliability to the weights assigned to the criteria of the AHP model, and consequently, a more accurate decision support. The results showed that the AHP model generated from a Bayesian Network is consistent with the conditional probabilities estimated by the BN, giving robustness to the decision sphere in the context of industrial maintenance. This AHP model can serve as a basis to be complemented by qualitative analysis criteria according to the need of the individual specialist, allowing the construction of strategic maintenance action plans.

AB  - Intensive research using chemical stabilization for improving subgrade soil has become increasingly popular around the globe. The alkaline activator additive provides an improved and effective alternative for cement, and also produces comparatively less CO2 emissions. This paper studied the factors that contribute to the strength development of silty sand, a typical subgrade soil in Kamloops, British Columbia (BC), Canada, by mixing different percentages of MgCl2 with alkaline activator (Na2SiO3/NaOH). A total of 64 samples, including the untreated sample, were tested using standard compaction tests and the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test under curing periods of 7, 14, 28, and 60 days. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) full factorial design was used to analyse the UCS results for determining the optimum design of the experiment. A significant compressive strength improvement on the treated soil sample was found using the proposed additive. The combination Na2SiO3/NaOH (0.5) ratio, alkaline activator-to-MgCl2 (0.7) ratio, and 3%, of MgCl2 percentage by dry weight of the soil was selected as the optimum additive design to improve the silty sand found in subgrades in Kamloops, BC.

AB  - The concept of green maintainability provides the building sector with an exciting opportunity to transform itself with highly maintainable and sustainable buildings. It spans throughout the building project delivery process and overarches different building systems. This paper aims to propose a set of critical green maintainability performance indicators for building projects; to minimize the adverse environmental impacts whilst maximizing the functional, safety, energy efficiency and financial performance of the facility. To overcome data deficiency challenges, a qualitative research approach was used in this study; consisting of a systematic literature review and expert interviews. The identified set of green maintainability indicators are validated using a pilot case study of an exemplary building project with highly desirable levels of green maintainability. The identified critical indicators are crucial in the development of a green maintainability assessment system. This study is a significant attempt to promote green maintainability among building professionals to advance the lifecycle sustainability of built environments by seeking to improve facility design processes with capable tools.

AB  - Mexican oregano is a non-timber forest product harvested in natural vegetation and represents an important source of income for rural families. Recent reports have highlighted decreases in natural populations caused by increased harvest intensity. Oregano leaf harvesting is a complex problem, involving different components and views, and has a clear spatial dimension. We proposed an analytical framework based on multi-criteria-multi-objective analyses. GIS tools were used as the platform for managing, displaying and analyzing ecological and socioeconomic information from different sources in order to evaluate land suitability of three different management strategies for two competing land objectives: oregano Harvest and oregano Regeneration. The incorporation of environmental evaluation criteria in the analysis allowed the identification of new potential oregano harvesting areas which were neither reported by harvesters, nor registered during harvesting trips. Socio-economic criteria, such as land tenure, highlighted the fact that a substantial proportion of current oregano harvesting areas are located outside ejido limits resulting in potential conflicts for resource access. The proposed Balanced oregano management strategy, in which the same proportion of suitable area (50%) was assigned to both objectives, represents the most favorable management strategy. This option allows harvesters to continue earning an income from oregano leaf harvest; and at the same time helps in the selection of the best areas for oregano regeneration. It also represents a management strategy with a smaller impact on oregano populations and on the harvesters´ income, as well as lower monitoring costs. The proposed analytical framework may contribute to advance the application of systematic approaches for solving decision-making problems in areas where oregano leaves and other NTFP are harvested.

AB  - Nowadays, companies have to improve their practices in the management of sustainable supply chain with increased awareness of environmental, economic and social issues globally. Selecting the optimum sustainable supplier is crucial for sustainable supply chain management, which is a challenging multi-dimensional problem. From a systematic perspective, sustainable supplier selection problem can be separated into two parts, including criteria and methods. This paper concentrates on the method selection aspects, referring to their application examples. Thus, the objectives of this paper are twofold: one is to summarize the literature on supplier selection issues from related articles, then to present an attempt to ontology-based approach to handling knowledge about sustainable supplier selection methods. To meet this aim, ontology-based model is proposed to synthetize the knowledge of analyzed methods and related papers. Finally, the proposed ontology-based model is demonstrated by an empirical example of using competency questions to confirm its correctness and effectiveness.

AB  - Background
Microbial whole genome sequencing (WGS) has many advantages over standard microbiological methods. However, it is not yet widely implemented in routine hospital diagnostics due to notable challenges.
Objectives
The aim was to extract managerial, financial and clinical criteria supporting the decision to implement WGS in routine diagnostic microbiology, across different operational models of implementation in the hospital setting.
Methods
This was a systematic review of literature identified through PubMed and Web of Science. English literature studies discussing the applications of microbial WGS without limitation on publication date were eligible. A narrative approach for categorization and synthesis of the sources identified was adopted.
Results
A total of 98 sources were included. Four main alternative operational models for incorporating WGS in clinical microbiology laboratories were identified: full in-house sequencing and analysis, full outsourcing of sequencing and analysis and two hybrid models combining in-house/outsourcing of the sequencing and analysis components. Six main criteria (and multiple related sub-criteria) for WGS implementation emerged from our review and included cost (e.g. the availability of resources for capital and operational investment); manpower (e.g. the ability to provide training programmes or recruit trained personnel), laboratory infrastructure (e.g. the availability of supplies and consumables or sequencing platforms), bioinformatics requirements (e.g. the availability of valid analysis tools); computational infrastructure (e.g. the availability of storage space or data safety arrangements); and quality control (e.g. the existence of standardized procedures).
Conclusions
The decision to incorporate WGS in routine diagnostics involves multiple, sometimes competing, criteria and sub-criteria. Mapping these criteria systematically is an essential stage in developing policies for adoption of this technology, e.g. using a multicriteria decision tool. Future research that will prioritize criteria and sub-criteria that were identified in our review in the context of operational models will inform decision-making at clinical and managerial levels with respect to effective implementation of WGS for routine use. Beyond WGS, similar decision-making challenges are expected with respect to future integration of clinical metagenomics.

AB  - Nowadays, educational centers are regarded as one of the most important buildings in cities; therefore, in the present study, the geographical suitability of the existing schools in two districts (6, 12) of Tehran Metropolitan, Iran, is studied using five standpoints including urban facilities, accessibility to urban road networks, population density, city services, and cultural centers. For this purpose, a stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) algorithm was applied to determine the importance of each subfactor. By use of “R” programming language, a combination of SWARA, radial basic function (RBF), and imperial competitive algorithm (ICA) was applied to eliminate SWARA gaps. Finally, five maps for factors, subfactors, and classes of each subfactor were developed. And, based on the location of existing schools and the final map, the site selection map for new schools in the two studied districts is presented. Also, the results showed that the percentage of schools in districts 6 and 12 in “good” areas was 24.30% and 40.80%, respectively. Therefore, the condition of schools located in district 12 is better than district 6. Additionally, the combination of the SWARA–RBF–ICA method rectified the SWARA method limitations and led to 5% more optimized results.

We put forward the notions of λ-indiscernibility relation and λ-approximation space in information systems. The properties of roughness for λ-approximation space are explored. To illustrate the usefulness of λ-approximation spaces, we provide two approaches to deal with a special type of multiattribute decision-making problems. By comparative analysis, the ranking results based on two different approaches have a high consensus. Although there are some different ranking results of these two methods, the optimal selected alternative is the same.

AB  - Background
Health economists ask members of the general public to value health states, but it is recognized that individuals construct their preferences during the valuation tasks. Conventional methods rely on one-off interviews that do not give participants time to reflect and deliberate on their preferences.
Objective
This study investigates the effect of reflection and deliberation on health state preferences using the EQ-5D questionnaire and time trade-off valuation method.
Methods
A novel concurrent explanatory mixed-methods design is used to investigate the explanation for the quantitative findings.
Results
A total of 57 participants in the United Kingdom valued health states before and after a group-based deliberation exercise. There were large changes in health state values at the individual level, but the changes canceled out at the aggregate level. The mixed-methods findings suggest deliberation did not reveal new information or reduce inconsistencies in reasoning but rather focused on an exchange of personal subjective beliefs. In cases of disagreement, the participants accepted but did not adopt other participants' opinions. Participants remained uncertain about the relevance of their experiences and about their values.
Conclusions
The evidence suggests that reflection and deliberation, as designed in this study, are unlikely to result in large systematic changes of health state values. The uncertainties expressed by participants means future research should investigate whether preferences are informed or whether providing participants with more information helps them construct their preferences with more certainty. The mixed-methods design used is a promising design to help elucidate the reasons for quantitative findings.

KW  - Multiple query criteria active learning
KW  - Integration criteria strategy
KW  - Sample query criterion
KW  - Weighted rank aggregation
AB  - Multiple query criteria active learning methods have a higher potential performance than conventional active learning methods in which only one criterion is deployed for sample selection. A central issue related to multiple query criteria active learning methods concerns the development of an integration criteria strategy that makes full use of all criteria. The conventional integration criteria strategies adopted in relevant research facilitate the desired effects, but several limitations still must be addressed. For instance, some of the strategies are not sufficiently scalable during the design process, and the number and type of criteria involved are dictated. Thus, it is challenging for the user to integrate other criteria into the original process unless modifications are made to the algorithm. Other strategies are too dependent on empirical parameters, which can be acquired only by experience or cross-validation and thus lack generality; additionally, these strategies are counter to the intention of active learning, as samples need to be labeled in the validation set before the active learning process can begin. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multiple query criteria active learning method for classification tasks that employs a third strategy via weighted rank aggregation. The proposed method serves as a heuristic means to select high-value samples of high scalability and generality and is implemented through a three-step process: (1) the transformation of the sample selection to sample ranking and scoring, (2) the computation of the self-adaptive weights of each criterion, and (3) the weighted aggregation of each sample rank list. Ultimately, the sample at the top of the aggregated ranking list is the most comprehensively valuable and must be labeled. Several experiments generating 419 wins, 226 ties and 55 losses against other state-of-the-art multiple query criteria-based methods are conducted to verify that the proposed method can achieve superior results.

AB  - Objective
Motivated by the well documented worldwide spread of adverse drug events, as well as the increased danger of antibiotic resistance (caused mainly by inappropriate prescribing and overuse), we propose a novel recommendation system for antibiotic prescription (PARS).
Method
Our approach is based on the combination of semantic technologies with MCDA (Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding) that allowed us to build a two level decision support model. Given a specific domain, the approach assesses the adequacy of an alternative/action (prescription of antibiotic) for a specific subject (patient) with an issue (bacterial infection) in a given context (medical). The goal of the first level of the decision support model is to select the set of alternatives which have the potential to be suitable. Then the second level sorts the alternatives into categories according to their adequacy using an MCDA sorting method (MR–Sort with Veto) and a structured set of description logic queries.
Results
We applied this approach in the domain of antibiotic prescriptions, working closely with the EpiCura Hospital Center (BE). Its performance was compared to the EpiCura recommendation guidelines which are currently in use. The results showed that the proposed system is more consistent in its recommendations when compared with the static EpiCura guidelines. Moreover, with PARS the antibiotic prescribing workflow becomes more flexible. PARS allows the user (physician) to update incrementally and dynamically a patient’s profile with more information, or to input knowledge modifications that accommodate the decision context (like the introduction of new side effects and antibiotics, the development of germs that are resistant, etc). At the end of our evaluation, we detail a number of limitations of the current version of PARS and discuss future perspectives.

AB  - Handling outliers are one of the primary concerns of today’s data mining techniques. The concept of outliers, it’s handling, and diagnosis is context specific and varies according to the field of application. The existence of outliers while mining web data is inevitable by virtue of unique characteristic features exhibited by a typical web user. As the output of a regression algorithm is always different from the actual value, it poses a challenge to the knowledge workers and researchers about the notion of an outlier in such cases. In this paper, we propose to develop the concept of an outlier with respect to regression analysis of any Web-based dataset. A framework to find outliers in the output of a regression algorithm is being formulated with the help of Ordered Weighted operators. The underlying idea is to find an error rectification value, ϵ, that will work, in association with the predicted value from the regression model and then help to distinguish an outlier. This will, in addition, also provide a possible range of deviation from the predicted output. A case study on a web dataset is being done to show the usefulness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Environmental assessments require the development and analysis of a large amount of data. Decision-makers must manage considerable amounts of information just to obtain a viable set of alternatives. The environmental assessment proposed in this study is a decision-support framework that facilitates obtaining results that endorse the decision-making process. This study aims to provide a fast and straightforward analysis of the influence of energy consumption in water treatment systems (energy-for-water) and its impact onto the environment, considering water quality requirements, water distribution systems, and how different energy combination setups affect these variables. The framework was applied to countries on the seashore experiencing water scarcity distress and world average greenhouse gas emissions regimes as examples, but it can also be applied to other types of systems. Energy-for-water greenhouse gas emissions can be decreased through the awareness-related measures reflected in the selection of energy sources, changing water desalination process, optimizing water intake, choosing water reuse, and using untreated seawater in industrial processes. Countries with the highest greenhouse gas emissions continue obtaining electricity from coal. Likewise, greenhouse gas emissions are lower in countries using nuclear energy as a source of electricity. However, the reliance on nuclear energy often depends on stakeholder approval.

AB  - The heat transfer performance of Plate Fin Heat Sink (PFHS) has been investigated experimentally and extensively. Commonly, the objective function of the PFHS design is based on the responses of simulations. Compared with existing studies, the purpose of this study is to transfer from analysis-based model to image-based one for heat sink designs. Compared with the popular objective function based on maximum, mean, variance values, etc., more information should be involved in image-based and thus a more objective model should be constructed. It means that the sequential optimization should be based on images instead of responses and more reasonable solutions should be obtained. Therefore, an image-based reconstruction model of a heat transfer process for a 3D-PFHS is established. Unlike image recognition, such procedure cannot be implemented by existing recognition algorithms (e.g. Convolutional Neural Network) directly. Therefore, a Reconstructive Neural Network (ReConNN), integrated supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques, is suggested and improved to achieve higher accuracy. According to the experimental results, the heat transfer process can be observed more detailed and clearly, and the reconstructed results are meaningful for the further optimizations.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) becomes the hot cake in all technological fields. IoT applications concurrently generate the huge amount of data that need to be handled. In this paper, an optimal mechanism is proposed to handle big data for decision making. Based on the classical decision-making process in the field of Big Data, we design an adaptive knowledge-based method through IoT application. A Bayesian network model is used to manage knowledge formation in all direction for the decision-making process. Knowledge of Bayesian networks is habitually emitted as an optimal solution, where the analysis job is to locate a formation that exploits a statistically motivated score. Generally, accessible knowledge tools deal with this optimal solution by means of ordinary search methods. As it required big amount of data space, therefore it is a time consuming procedure that should be avoided. The situation becomes decisive once big data involve in searching for optimal solution. An algorithm is introduced to accomplish faster processing of optimal solution by limiting the search data space. The proposed recursive algorithm will limit the search space. The result shows that the optimal mechanism of the decision process is able to handle big data by reducing processing time, computational complexity and a higher percentage of prediction rates.

AB  - Heavy metals present in industrial wastewater contribute to human and ecosystem health risk when discharged without proper treatment. Low-cost biosorbents with high metal-binding capacity are increasingly being utilized for the removal of heavy metals. Inherent physico-chemical properties of biosorbents significantly influence their adsorption capacity. Studies quantifying the influence exerted by these properties on adsorption capacity are scarce. This study quantifies the influence and relative importance of selected physico-chemical properties on the adsorption capacity of three divalent heavy metals; Cu2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+ using multivariate analysis. Twenty one biosorbent mixtures were created, systematically varying their physico-chemical properties using tea factory waste and coconut shell biochar. Their adsorption capacities were measured using batch sorption studies. The influence of physico-chemical properties on the adsorption capacity is comparable for all three metal cations. Regression models were developed to quantify the influence of physico-chemical parameters on the adsorption capacity based on regression coefficients. All models were found to have high reliability with R2 values above 0.98. Acidic surface functional groups were found to act as the key property that governs the adsorption capacity of Pb2+, Cu2+ and Cd2+. Carboxylic groups played a major role in the adsorption of Cu2+ and Pb2+, while lactonic groups were more important in providing binding sites to Cd2+. SSA failed to demonstrate a significant impact on the adsorption capacity of these three metals on its own when the biosorbent had a low surface functional group density.

Our decision-making platform for bidding is based on intelligent agents. These agents will seek tenders in relation to the specialty area of the company. Then they will make calculations and generate a report which contains the description of the offers found and the details of the studies applied to these offers. Finally, the final decision, that is to say, is that the company can apply to win the project or not knowing that the agent knows the potential of the company and its limits. During our project, we discuss several relevant concepts as follows: Artificial Intelligence; Intelligent agents; Web Mining; Big data.

AB  - Production of defensible modelling tools for aquifer vulnerability mapping under the conditions of sparse data remains topical using the DRASTIC framework. DRASTIC is the acronym for seven data layers using a prescribed scoring system in terms of rates to account for local variations and weights to account for the relative importance of data layers. Also, the term framework signifies the consensual nature of choosing the data layers without any theoretical or empirical basis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) or similar techniques are used to reduce inherent subjectivities through a strategy of unsupervised learning from data by formulating Multiple Frameworks (MF) and supervised learning from Multiple Models (MMs) without searching for any ‘superior’ model. Notably, a framework lacks the procedure for iterative training and testing, as usual in modelling procedures. In this strategy, models are organised in two hierarchical levels: Level 1 comprises the construction of MFs (two frameworks) and/or MMs (two models); Level 2 comprises a model or an algorithm to reuse the outputs from Level 1 through formulating four strategies, including a mixture of MFs/ MMs, in which Support Vector Machine (SVM) is chosen by the paper to run models at Level 2. The supervision process uses target values as a function of observed nitrate-N values. The strategy is applied to the aquifer in the Malekan region, where the past extensive agricultural practices have been transformed into intensive use of fertilisers without protecting water quality in the aquifers. Results show that AIMM/MF lead to significant improvements in delineating high vulnerability areas.

AB  - Local rough sets as a generalization of classical rough sets not only inherit the advantages of classical rough sets which can handle imprecise, fuzzy and uncertain data, but also break through the limitation of classical rough sets requiring large amount of labeled data. The existing researches on local rough sets mainly use the relative quantitative information between a target concept and equivalence classes of those objects contained in the target concept to approximate the target concept. This ignores the information differences of equivalence classes concerned containing the relevant concept, namely the absolute quantitative information. We propose Local Logical Disjunction Double-quantitative Rough Sets (LLDDRS) model based on the importance, completeness and complementary nature of the relative and absolute quantitative information to describe an approximation space. This provides an effective tool for discovering knowledge and making decisions in relation to large data sets. In this paper we first study the important properties, optimal computing of rough regions and decision rules of the LLDDRS model. Then we explore the relationships of the proposed LLDDRS model and other representative models. Finally, we present experimental comparisons showing the computational efficiency and approximate accuracy of the LLDDRS model in concept approximation.

AB  - Nearly 1.24 million people die every year in traffic accidents. More than 20% of the number of deaths are pedestrians. Traffic crashes will become, in 2030, the fifth leading cause of deaths worldwide. A considerable amount of these accidents occurs due to either imprudence or lack of dexterity of the driver. More than 70% of traffic accidents are attributed to human error, such as perception errors as distance judgment error or simply by lack of attention. Because of the problem aforementioned, this work proposes the development and discussion of a pedestrian recognition system using an automotive radar of 79 GHz. The main idea is to early detect pedestrians using the micro Doppler characteristics of the human body in near to crash situations (0–15 m). Based on these requirements, at first this work presents the improvement of velocity resolution of the radar system with the objective of extracting the micro Doppler characteristics of the objects. The improvement of velocity resolution was reached assuming the application of multi-objective optimization techniques, in this case Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Search (RS) were adopted, enhancing the quality of the radar signal. Based on radar measures of velocity and range, a machine learning approach was considered in order to classify objects detected by the radar. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was assumed to distinguish pedestrians and non-pedestrians objects. Four different SVM based models were considered in this work, aiming the improvement of both classification performance and speed, comparing three different kernel functions. As a result, it was possible to verify the advantages of the multi-objective optimization to extract the micro Doppler effects based on radar signals. Moreover, the optimization reached the velocity resolution of 0.12 m/s. To conclude, we showed that a model involving a polynomial kernel for the SVM reported better result in terms of accuracy (99.5%), confirming the promising perspectives of vehicles embedded radar-based safety systems.

KW  - Demand forecasting
KW  - Decision-making

KW  - Paradigm change
AB  - Medium- and long-term planning, defined here as 10 years or longer, in the energy and water sectors is fraught with uncertainty, exacerbated by an accelerating ‘paradigm shift’. The new paradigm is characterised by a changing climate and rapid adoption of new technologies, accompanied by changes in end-use practices. Traditional methods (such as econometrics) do not incorporate these diverse and dynamic aspects and perform poorly when exploring long-term futures. This paper critiques existing methods and explores how interdisciplinary insights could provide methodological innovation for exploring future energy and water demand. The paper identifies four attributes that methods need to capture to reflect at least some of the uncertainty associated with the paradigm shift: stochastic events, the diversity of behaviour, policy interventions and the ‘co-evolution’ of the variables affecting demand. Machine-learning methods can account for some of the four identified attributes and can be further enhanced by insights from across the psychological and social sciences (human geography and sociology), incorporating rebound effect and the unevenness of demand, and acknowledging the emergent nature of demand. The findings have implications for urban and regional planning of infrastructure and contribute to current debates on nexus thinking for energy and water resource management.

The finding showed that a large proportion of agricultural land was converted into commercial areas to accommodate economic development and population growth. Furthermore, construction of anti-flood structure infrastructure in PNSA increased flood intensity and duration in three neighboring districts as more floodwater was diverted to the peri-urban area. In addition, this research looks into the social impacts related to land use change and anti-flood structural infrastructure.

Alignment of exposures across traditional data streams such as data from in vivo laboratory animal and epidemiological or clinical studies, as well as integration of novel data types from emerging testing technologies and new methods of analysis, will improve causal inference. We propose a mechanistic scaffold that supports a source-to-outcome structure and an associated workflow pipeline which facilitates needed data curation and transparency regarding operational assumptions. The scaffold and workflow components enhance the utility and repurposing of data with the flexibility to support regulatory decision-making in a fit-for-purpose fashion. Efficient use of data based on this scaffold across various modeling approaches will promote “one health” characterization to improve, promote, and protect the health of all species and the environment. Associated data standards to facilitate leveraging and sharing of data will increase communication and collaboration across different disciplines to enable that end.

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV), including homicides is a widespread and significant public health problem, disproportionately affecting immigrant, refugee and indigenous women in the United States (US). This paper describes the protocol of a randomized control trial testing the utility of administering culturally tailored versions of the danger assessment (DA, measure to assess risk of homicide, near lethality and potentially lethal injury by an intimate partner) along with culturally adapted versions of the safety planning (myPlan) intervention: a) weWomen (designed for immigrant and refugee women) and b) ourCircle (designed for indigenous women). Safety planning is tailored to women's priorities, culture and levels of danger. Many abused women from immigrant, refugee and indigenous groups never access services because of factors such as stigma, and lack of knowledge of resources. Research is, therefore, needed to support interventions that are most effective and suited to the needs of abused women from these populations in the US. In this two-arm trial, 1250 women are being recruited and randomized to either the web-based weWomen or ourCircle intervention or a usual safety planning control website. Data on outcomes (i.e., safety, mental health and empowerment) are collected at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months post- baseline. It is anticipated that the findings will result in an evidence-based culturally tailored intervention for use by healthcare and domestic violence providers serving immigrant, refugee and indigenous survivors of IPV. The intervention may not only reduce risk for violence victimization, but also empower abused women and improve their mental health outcomes.

To enhance the effectiveness of FMEA, a great many multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods have been applied for properly evaluating the risk of failure modes over the past two decades. However, there is a lack of study concerning systematic literature review and classification of the researches on this topic. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the FMEA studies using MCDM approaches for evaluation and prioritization of failure modes. To do so, a total of 169 journal papers extracted from the online database over the period of 1998–2018 were selected and reviewed. These publications were classified into 10 categories according to the used MCDM methods, and analyzed in regard to the risk factors, risk factor weighting methods, and risk assessment methods in FMEA. Furthermore, a bibliometric analysis was performed based on the frequency of MCDM methods, number of citations, year of publication, appeared journals, country of origin and application areas. This research supports academics and practitioners in effectively adopting MCDM methods to overcome the deficiencies of the traditional FMEA and provides an insight into its state-of-the-art.

AB  - Neighborhood Multigranulation Rough Sets (NMGRS), constructed by a family of neighborhood relations, can effectively obtain required knowledge from Neighborhood Information Systems (NIS). In various practical situations, NIS may alter dynamically with time. Incremental learning is an alternative manner for maintaining knowledge by utilizing previous computational results under dynamic data contexts. In dynamic NIS with numerical data, potential useful knowledge, e.g., the positive, boundary and negative regions in NMGRS, needs to be updated for various applications. To address this issue, we present matrix-based incremental approaches to update knowledge in NMGRS with the addition or deletion of granular structures. First, a matrix-based representation of neighborhood multigranulation rough approximations is developed. Then, the matrix-based dynamic strategies are proposed to update the positive, boundary, and negative regions in the optimistic and pessimistic NMGRS under the variation of a granular structure. In accordance with the proposed updating strategies, the matrix-based dynamic algorithms are explored for maintaining the positive, boundary and negative regions while adding or deleting granular structures. Finally, comparative experiments are conducted to show that the matrix-based dynamic algorithms are feasible and effective.

In this paper, the authors propose a model to rank tourist sites of a city, based on OWA operators, with the objective of being used as a recommender system.

AB  - Supplier selection is the process by which firms identify, evaluate, and contract with suppliers. The supplier selection process deploys an enormous amount of a firm’s financial resources and plays crucial role for the success of any organization. The main objective of supplier selection process is to reduce purchase risk, maximize overall value to the purchaser, and develop closeness and long-term relationships between buyers and suppliers. The literature on supplier selection criteria and methods is full of various analytical approaches. Some researchers have developed hybrid models by combining more than one type of selection methods. The current paper provides an overall picture of research on supply chain management, supplier selection criteria and supplier selection evaluation methods (multi-criteria decision making). A summary of the process of supplier selection can be helpful for companies to have a clear understanding of the concept in order to improve their success and competitiveness. The results show that the application of a structured decision-making technique is vital, especially under the complex conditions that include both qualitative and quantitative criteria.

AB  - This study proposes an Island Parallel Evolutionary Extreme Learning Machine algorithm (IPE-ELM) for the well-known data classification problem. The ELM is a fast and efficient machine learning technique with its single-hidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN). High prediction accuracy and learning speed of the ELM make it an elegant tool for the fitness calculation process of the evolutionary algorithms. The IPE-ELM algorithm combines the evolutionary genetic algorithms (for feature selection), ELM machine learning technique (for prediction accuracy calculation), parallel computation (for faster fitness evaluation), and parameter tuning (activation function selection and the number of hidden neurons) for the solution of this important problem. Each ELM that runs at a different processor selects one of four different activation functions (Sine, Cosine, Sigmoid and Hyperbolic Tangent) and uses a randomized number of hidden neurons to achieve higher prediction accuracy. The proposed algorithm provides high quality results with its (near)-linear scalability behavior. The IPE-ELM algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art data classification algorithms by using UCI benchmark datasets and significant improvements are reported in terms of prediction accuracy with reasonable execution times. The scalable IPE-ELM algorithm can be reported as the first island parallel evolutionary classification algorithm with its high prediction accuracy results that outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in literature.

AB  - Sustainable transportation is a popular concept with great influence in political decisions. After a general description of its main traits, we present the general characteristics of passengers and freight transportation in order to discuss later the importance of their environmental impact. Then we give an introduction to the main sources of energy, which give support to each transportation mode, presenting the main intermodal systems. An explanation about how to make decisions in conflicting scenarios is presented in the following section. Finally, some emerging trends in sustainable transportation are provided, along with conclusions.

AB  - The aim of this study is to adapt a well-known interactive and multi-criteria decision-making method, TODIM, to the portfolio allocation process. The proposed method is applied to empirical US equity data by employing variance, correlation and returns calculated on different observation periods as decision criteria. A total of 440 different configurations are applied to analyze the impact of several parameters in TODIM. Based on the results for the test period, outperforming TODIM configurations are elected. In the validation period, it is empirically demonstrated that portfolios based on outperforming TODIM configurations yield significantly better results than equally weighted portfolios (1/N) and insignificantly inferior results than the minimum variance portfolio (MVP) in terms of the Sharpe ratio. However, TODIM may still be a better choice than MVP for investors sensitive to concentration risk and turnover costs.

AB  - Nowadays, the design of smart buildings (micro smart grids) has become one of the major concerns of almost all countries. Relying on clean or renewable energies to power homes, institutions or even factories has become a reality and an inevitable future. However, the distribution of energy stored or obtained must be done in an intelligent way to best serve all the building entities taking into consideration several factors such as: their priorities, nature of activities, the energy required, the duration of daily activity. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the primary components for micro smart grids, indeed thanks to IoT we can not only do the tele-survey of the consumption, but especially back up the reports to a controller entity allowing adapt the energy policy of the entire building. As a result, when we talk about a smart building, we are talking about a distributed sensor architecture. The management of these sensors must be done centrally to facilitate: (1) the prediction of the energy to be demanded, (2) the application of new energy balancing policies, (3) and the promotion of a source of energy compared to another depending on the weather conditions. Software-Defined Network (SDN) is an approach to orchestrate from a central point called a controller a set of nodes or devices present in the network and can be perfectly matched to the points previously discussed. Our contribution is in the context of the micro-smart grid, our paper proposes a new architecture for the efficient management and intelligent distribution of electrical energy obtained from all sources of renewable energy by adopting an SDN approach and by exploiting IoT sensors. The architecture is called Micro Smart Grid by Software-Defined Network (MSGSDN). A new algorithm is modeled and developed allowing this intelligent sharing.

AB  - Interactive data visualization has become an important tool for business executives in monitoring key performance indicators, analyzing business process data, and managing individual and organizational performances. One of the key features in interactive data visualization is that users have direct control over how information is presented during the decision-making process. Few studies have examined how users choose visualization formats in such an environment. In this study, we investigate how cognitive style, spatial ability, and task difficulty affect the preference and choice of visualization formats and how the chosen visualization format in turn affects decision accuracy and confidence. Our results show that the choice of visualization format is affected by a user's cognitive style and task difficulty. While decision performances in accuracy and confidence are affected by task difficulty, spatial ability, and visualization format, they are largely not affected by the interactions between visualization format and cognitive style, spatial ability, and task difficulty.
