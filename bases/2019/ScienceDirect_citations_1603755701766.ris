AB  - Abstract:
As the speed of mobile phone updates continues to accelerate, the self-service mobile phone recycling mode, led by third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLs), has ushered in an important developmental era. This paper proposes a novel interval-valued Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy best-worst multi-criteria large group decision-making method to research the selection of 3PRLs. To minimize the influence of subjective factors and maximize the mathematical analysis method, some related improvements have been made to the traditional best worst method (BWM). First, in order to make an effective strategic assessment and achieve overall optimization of the organization, evaluators are grouped by the self-organized maps (SOM) method to balance the coordination ability and professional level of different groups. Next, the interval Pythagoras hesitant fuzzy set (IPHFS) is used to evaluate the criteria of 3PRLs selection. Then, according to above evaluation results, the BWM method and deviation model are combined to determine the weights of criteria. Finally, the traditional BWM is extended by ranking functions to determine the optimal 3PRL. The applicability of the proposed method is numerically demonstrated by solving a real case, and the key conclusions are that the technical factor is important to affecting the choice of 3PRLs. At the same time, the quantity and price of recycled components on End of Life (EOL) and used mobile phones also have important impacts on the selection of 3PRLs.

AB  - Prior studies in sustainable development have been conducted since its introduction, however, there is evidence in the literature that sustainable supply chain finance is still lacking, in particular, in relation to developing measurements to analyze the benefit and cost attributes. Furthermore, these studies did not also identify an ideal hierarchical structure, which is key for accuracy of decisions making. Hence, this paper contributes to the literature by constructing a set of measurements and analyzing the benefits and costs in the textile industry. In this paper, a fuzzy interpretive structural model was developed to build a hierarchical model, and a fuzzy TODIM was applied to determine the linguistic preferences and identify the benefits and costs. The results obtained show that sustainable supply chain finance improves firms' competitive advantages through multiple attributes, which imply that collaboration value innovation, strategic competitive advantage and financial attributes are the most important aspects for improving firm's performance. The results also indicate that to build a successful sustainable supply chain finance, firms should upgrade the synchronization of financial-related decisions, obtain price and cost information, focus on product and service quality, and ensure the dispersion of dependent and interdepartmental interactions.

AB  - Increasing the reliability of machine tools and reducing possible risks during the manufacturing process is crucial for the future of industry. The failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) method is reliant upon the experience of experts to determine the primary failure modes and detect the most critical factors for preventing risk. Clearly, an effective method capable of integrating the various different expert opinions is required. This study proposes a novel FMEA model based on multi-criteria group decision-making, which is developed by integrating a rough best–worst method, and modified rough technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution for ranking failure modes. The model can overcome some of the limitations of the conventional FMEA. It also includes the expected cost as a risk element to provide a more practical result. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by conducting a case study involving a machine tool company. The results indicate that the proposed model can effectively assist managers in evaluating risk factors and identifying critical failure modes.

AB  - Due to very large strain rates, deformations and temperature changes, selection of optimal hot extrusion process parameters of aluminum alloy composite is aexigent problem in metal processing. Hence in the present work, simulation is performed by varying Cone Half Angle (CHA), billet temperature and friction coefficient at a ram speed of 5mm/s using DEFORM-3D which is FEM simulation software. The effect of change of process parameters were observed with respect to the multiple criteria extrusion load, exit temperature, damage and displacement and the optimal process parameters were selected using a hybrid multiple criteria decision making technique, a combined AHP and TOPSIS approach. AHP is used to prioritize the criteria and the TOPSIS method used to rank the process parameters.

AB  - The integration of Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study with the Decision-Matrix Risk Assessment (DMRA) technique and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) as well, is proposed as a new framework for identifying critical points and potential hazards and also prioritizing risks, in industry. Therefore, the objective of this article is the development and application of the extended HAZOP-DMRA-AHP approach (E-HAZOP) in process industries. Initially, the application of the conventional HAZOP study is performed (as a case study) in a sour crude-oil processing-plant in order to identify the possible fault causes of abnormal conditions (deviations) in the plant. With the results of the HAZOP study on the one hand, and the usage of the DMRA risk assessment technique for assessing the risks, on the other side, the typical AHP process is then introduced, in order to extend HAZOP analysis by prioritizing the risks in the worksite of the plant. The proposed E-HAZOP framework can provide a trustworthy basis to boost process safety and improve occupational health and safety. Moreover, it could be a useful tool for the decision makers to estimate the emergency of investing constrained budget in actions preventing specific kind of deviations.

AB  - Lead-users are ahead of important trends, which makes them valuable resources when it comes to generate ideas for new products in the early stages of a company's new product development process. In later stages – e.g. just before market entry when prototypes of the new products are available and can be tested – the company's market research usually focuses on average users or representative samples of users since their measured acceptance of the prototypes can be used to predict sales volumes or market shares. However, in the media industry, prototypes of new products are often made publically available as alpha or beta versions and may especially attract high shares of lead-users for testing. In this paper we analyze the potential effects of these biased samples on the prediction of sales volumes or market shares. A sample of lead-users and other users tests the prototype of a mobile augmented reality app. Then, the acceptance of this media innovation is measured applying a lead-usership extended version of the UTAUT2 model. Our results show that behavioral intention and the effects of influencing factors substantially differ between lead-users and other users. We argue that knowing these differences can help to reduce risks of biased prediction of sales volumes or market shares.

AB  - Startups are a rising trend among entrepreneurs regardless of age, educational background, and gender. However, given the rapid increase in the number of newly established startups, the percent of businesses that fail is not insignificant. One of the many reasons why startups fail is the difficulty of identifying a clear value proposition from the customer's perspective. This should be carefully considered. Hence, this research aims to analyze the information on Internet startup value propositions from the customer's perspective, during the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, to observe changing trends of value propositions and predict their development in the next decade as a reference for future startups. Overall, value propositions from the customer's perspective have gradually shifted over the last three decades. Several value propositions in particular, including privacy protection, security services, and legitimacy in trust, are receiving increasingly more attention from customers. From 2020 onwards, community and emotion will maintained sustainably and will continue to develop strongly. Above all, the value imparted by privacy protection and security services will remain a prime concern among the new generation of Internet startups.

AB  - In recent years, more and more existing building has an ever increasing requirement of retrofit, which has been developed from individual measure to combination package of multiple measures. It has become the challenging task for screening building multiple energy retrofit measures package (BMERMP). In this paper, a stepwise screening methodology for BMERMP is proposed considering economic and risk aspects, which integrates Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) and Monte Carlo (MC) analysis. First of all, this paper puts forward a calculation reference table for energy saving retrofit potential. In addition, this paper also uses unit energy saving incremental cost (UESIC) to screen technology and suggests economic internal rate of return（EIRR）as cost-benefit analysis index of BMERMP. Furthermore, the authors propose the concept of Value-at-Risk (VaR) as an effective measure to control the risk. The VaR for EIRR is determined by risk variation and can be obtained through MC simulation. Meanwhile, the study takes a commercial building for example, this building comprises 19 measures in initial BMERMP by energy diagnosis and the VaR of initial BMERMP is 97.6%, which has a high risk. According to the ranking of UESIC value, when 4 high cost technologies are reduced, the VaR can be reduced to 0.07%, then the economy of BMERMP is feasible and the risk is controllable. This paper provides a new perspective for the decision maker to select BMERMP.

Despite significant subsidies, the rail mode (China Railway Express) continues to struggle with low load factor. Accordingly, a competition model (rail vs. maritime) grounded on game-theoretic technique is proposed to analyze the effect of the government subsidy on shippers’ mode switching (from maritime to rail) behavior. Analytical results based on a case of China-Germany rail freight transportation describe shippers’ mode switching patterns in response to a mode subsidy and suggest a subsidy scheme for the government.

AB  - The Generation Expansion Planning (GEP) stands as one as one of the most discussed topics within the academia and decision makers in the energy sector, especially related to meeting deep emission reduction targets. Every country, aiming at decarbonizing its economy, focuses on the application of policies that could enhance the penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in its power capacity mix. GEP is a complex task, combining techno-economic, financial, spatial and environmental characteristics. Several models are developed to model GEP, applying different methodological approaches. The underlying theory is very important as it might inherit bias in the resulted outcomes. The debate on the appropriateness of each methodology is increased, especially as projected outlooks deviate from reality. The paper aims to provide a review of the models employed to integrate RES in the GEP. The paper classifies models in three generic categories: optimisation models, general/partial equilibrium models and alternative models, not adopting the optimum integration of RES in the GEP. It provides insights on the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of the theoretical approaches implemented, as well on their suitability for different aspects of the problem, contributing in the better understanding on the expected outcomes of each methodology.

AB  - Through the provision of a range of essential services, infrastructure systems profoundly influence development. At a time of increasing global investment in infrastructure, there is a need to support practitioners in making informed choices in order to achieve progress toward sustainable development objectives. Using the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (the SDGs) as a framework to structure infrastructure decision-making and trade-offs, this analysis develops a performance indicator system that assesses the potential development implications of a portfolio of infrastructure investments and policies. We develop metrics to assess the performance of infrastructure-linked targets. We then embed these metrics in a systems model that allows for the quantification of future infrastructure needs and the assessment of portfolios of infrastructure investments and policies that contribute to meeting these needs. These methods are applied to the small-island country of Curaçao, demonstrating the potential for meeting the SDGs through adoption of strategies of cross-sectoral infrastructure investments and policies in the energy, water, wastewater and solid waste sectors. In the face of growing demands for infrastructure services, we find that inaction with regard to infrastructure supply and demand will lead to a 28% decrease in average SDG achievement across these targets by 2030. We assemble a portfolio of interventions that provide infrastructure services across these four sectors that enable achievement of 19 SDG targets directly linked to infrastructure. These interventions imply scaling up of infrastructure where there are gaps in service provision, ranging from an overall 10% increase in the water sector to a 368% increase in waste sector infrastructure from current capacities by 2030. Achieving the SDGs does not necessarily imply more infrastructure: in the energy sector the sustainable policy implies demand reductions of 32% from current levels. Nearly 50% of the assessed targets require intervention in more than one sector, emphasising the interdependent nature of the infrastructure system. The analysis addresses future uncertainties around the key drivers of residential population and tourism growth on the island by modelling infrastructure needs for alternate scenario projections. Averaged across the four sectors, these needs range from −14% (low) to +5% (high) in relation to the moderate projection. The analysis provides the first step towards a practical means of utilising infrastructure to deliver the SDGs, using quantitative indicators to underpin effective decision-making.

AB  - Incorporating values of the public in decisions is a way to approach accountability, transparency and inclusiveness in disaster management, but may not be an easy fit with existing systems. In this study, we analysed a bushfire risk planning system in Victoria, Australia, to identify where and how values, and value conflicts, are managed in decision-making. Using a modified institutional approach, we found a diverse set of seven strategies by which values are managed in different parts and levels of the planning system. At the policy level, cycling through time and multiple objective setting established priorities and frameworks for staff at lower levels. At the strategic planning level, a bias to measurable values and institutional norms for relying on science limited consideration of some social values. In a previously undescribed strategy for managing values, ‘risk prioritisation’, technical risk analysis was used to prioritise places for protection, overshadowing difficult questions of value. Finally, in moving to decisions, both team deliberation and weighting strategies were used to balance values. Staff recognised a need for new tools and processes for managing some social values. An obvious opportunity for incorporating values of the public in this system is to include them in the sets of multiple objectives that guide planning. Staff also saw opportunities to expand community engagement and develop qualitative ways to justify decisions, but these faced some challenges within longstanding institutional norms for basing decisions on ecological and bushfire sciences.

AB  - Mining Co-operatives wield significant influence over the mining sector. These organizations have been getting increasing importance to support diggers through initiatives and policies to improve small-scale mining activities. In spite of the importance of cooperatives to the local communities, studies on their role and contribution towards sustainable business practices in the sector are still scarce. This paper investigates the scenario of mining Co-operatives in Brazil through a set of interviews to the managers of these Co-operatives, which allowed to conclude on the relevance of the sector to establish a sustainable network into the mining sector in the country. The results indicated some key concerns related to lack of awareness towards cooperative principles and environmental impacts and the reduced engagement with local community. The need to improve knowledge and academic background of both diggers and managers emerged as a major challenge to be overcome to ensure that cooperative principles are effectively put in place and guide the cooperatives towards sustainable development

AB  - Bioretention modified media consists of modifier, soil, sand, and organic matter (OM), which was applied to clean rainfall runoff pollutants and control flood. These should support plant growth, cost-effectiveness, local availability besides rainwater runoff and its pollution control. A modified bioretention media design approach was developed, to determine whether the modified media could compensate the deficiency of infiltration and/or purification ability for traditional bioretention soil mixing (BSM) and undisturbed soil. Taking the soil conditions of a typical area in northwest China as an example, we defined the BSM as the mixture of river sand, soil and wood chips, and the ratio was 65:30:5 by mass, and modified media are a mixture of BSM with modifiers. The characteristics of ten modifiers were tested, and the proportions of BSM and modifiers were determined though Langmuir adsorption isotherm mainly. The infiltration capacities of modified media were over 220 mm/h, and they were more than 3.4 times that of undisturbed soil. We also got the maximum adsorption capacity and longest lifespan media which were BSM + 10% water treatment residuals (WTR) for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and BSM + 10% green zeolite (GZ) for ammonia though batch and mini-column experiments. Based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP), considering infiltration, water-holding adsorption, lifespan, and cost, the comprehensive performance of modified media is as follows: BSM + 10% flyash (0.2683) > BSM + 10% GZ (0.2589) > BSM + 10% WTR (0.2443) > BSM + 10% medical (0.1553) > BSM (0.0731). The results of this study will contribute to a greater understanding of adsorption mechanism of bioretention system media, contributing to the design and evaluation of bioretention efficient media.

AB  - A perforated-type regenerative type evaporative humidifier is presented which has an innovative flow configuration. Such a flow configuration prevents the moist air from achieving quick saturation, and as a result, it maximizes the humidification capacity. A control volume formulation based mathematical model is developed which is simulated using nested numerical techniques having coupled boundary conditions. The system performance is gauged by three objective functions, namely humidification capacity, total electrical energy consumption, and efficiency factor. A detailed sensitivity analysis is carried out to report the system performance with respect to outdoor air conditions, geometric parameters, and operating conditions. Afterwards, an optimization study is conducted for 11 different climatic zones all around the world. An optimized humidification capacity of ∼32 gwater vapor/min, energy consumption of 2.1 kW, and an efficiency factor of ∼40% is reported for the proposed configuration for dry climatic zone which is 64%, 11%, and 26% more than a direct-contact evaporative humidifier respectively. It is also found that the optimal ranges for channel length, channel width, channel height, and water temperature, are 900–1000 mm, 55–60 cm, 7–8 mm, and 60–70 °C, respectively.

AB  - This work aims to evaluate the influences of the water content dissolved in crude oil and of the meter factor on the uncertainty of the fiscal oil measuring system using ultrasonic flow meters, considering that the overall uncertainty of the measuring system shall not exceed 0.3%. The development of this work was motivated by the fact that the Brazilian Technical Regulation for the Measurement of Oil and Natural Gas (RTM) limits which methodologies can be used for water analysis and defines the maximum permissible uncertainty for the oil flow meter in which this analysis is inserted. However, the RTM does not define the uncertainty required for the water analysis. There is a risk of adopting one of the permitted methods of analysis and, even so, the measurement uncertainty of the flow meter exceeding the values defined by the legislation. In addition, the RTM adopts a repeatability criterion when validating the calibration of ultrasonic meters, thus the influence of this aspect on the oil uncertainty is also evaluated. The methodology used is the design of experiments and response surfaces. The results demonstrate that it is possible to simulate the influence of the water content and of the meter factor uncertainties on the overall uncertainty of the oil flow measuring system. Finally, the conclusions show that the average uncertainties currently observed for the water content are adequate to keep the oil measuring system uncertainty within the range allowed by the RTM, but small variations may cause this limit to be exceeded. The influence of the meter factor uncertainty was less than or similar to the influence of the water content. Finally, adoption of an acceptance criterion for the ultrasonic meters based on the uncertainty instead of repeatability is suggested.

AB  - Abstract
Groundwater is an important natural resource for drinking and irrigation. Nevertheless, identifying potential sources in Ethiopia still presents a challenge in terms of time and costs for solving water scarcity problems and managing groundwater systems. To address these issues, this study combines optical and microwave remote sensing to identify groundwater potential zones in Ketar watershed, Ethiopia. Two Sentinel families, Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2AMulti-Spectral Instrument (MSI) images, were processed to derive a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and thematic layers (lineament density, soil moisture, land-use/land-cover, drainage density, slope, and geomorphology) for the study area. Secondary data were used to produce geological units, soil texture, and rainfall thematic layers. These nine total layers were considered proxies to signify groundwater occurrence and analyzed in GIS environment with a consistency ratio (CR = 0.013). Since each proxy contributes differently to the occurrence of groundwater, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique was used to assign individual weights to each factor. These factors were reclassified based on standard criteria and aggregated using Weighted Linear Combination (WLC). Results of a weight comparison show that geological unit, rainfall, soil texture, slope and lineament density are the dominant factors controlling groundwater occurrence. The WLC classifies the area of potential groundwater zones into five classes: very low (607.64 km2), low (942.19), moderate (777.2), high (598.74) and very high (428.23). These zones were validated using 43 existing data points of boreholes, hand-dug wells, and springs and have a correlation coefficient of 0.93. The outcome of this study emphasizes the importance of integrated optical and microwave remote sensing in identifying potential groundwater zones with a better accuracy to address issues of water scarcity in Ethiopia.

AB  - Additive manufacturing (AM) enables enormous freedom for design of complex structures. However, the process-dependent limitations that result in discrepancies between as-designed and as-manufactured shapes are not fully understood. The tradeoffs between infinitely many different ways to approximate a design by a manufacturable replica are even harder to characterize. To support design for AM (DfAM), one has to quantify local discrepancies introduced by AM processes, identify the detrimental deviations (if any) to the original design intent, and prescribe modifications to the design and/or process parameters to countervail their effects. Our focus in this work will be on topological analysis. There is ample evidence in many applications that preserving local topology (e.g., connectivity of beams in a lattice) is important even when slight geometric deviations can be tolerated. We first present a generic method to characterize local topological discrepancies due to material under-and over-deposition in AM, and show how it captures various types of defects in the as-manufactured structures. We use this information to systematically modify the as-manufactured outcomes within the limitations of available 3D printer resolution(s), which often comes at the expense of introducing more geometric deviations (e.g., thickening a beam to avoid disconnection). We validate the effectiveness of the method on 3D examples with nontrivial topologies such as lattice structures and foams.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are increasingly under threat as they are confronted with multiple anthropogenic impairments. This calls for comprehensive management strategies to counteract, or even prevent, long-term impacts on habitats and their biodiversity, as well as on their ecological functions and services. The basis for the efficient management and effective conservation of any ecosystem is sufficient knowledge on the state of the system and its response to external influence factors. In freshwater ecosystems, state information is currently drawn from ecological assessments at the reach or site scale. While these assessments are essential, they are not sufficient to assess the expected outcome of different river restoration strategies, because they do not account for important characteristics of the whole river network, such as habitat connectivity or headwater reachability. This is of particular importance for the spatial prioritization of restoration measures. River restoration could be supported best by integrative catchment-scale ecological assessments that are sensitive to the spatial arrangement of river reaches and barriers. Assessments at this scale are of increasing interest to environmental managers and conservation practitioners to prioritize restoration measures or to locate areas worth protecting. We present an approach based on decision support methods that integrates abiotic and biotic ecological assessments at the reach-scale and aggregates them spatially to describe the ecological state of entire catchments. This aggregation is based on spatial criteria that represent important ecological catchment properties, such as fish migration potential, resilience, fragmentation and habitat diversity in a spatially explicit way. We identify the most promising assessment criteria from different alternatives based on theoretical considerations and a comparison with biological indicators. Potential applications are discussed, particularly for supporting the strategic, long-term planning and spatial prioritization of restoration measures.

AB  - Solid waste management (SWM) is an integral part of an environmental management system. SWM approaches have been modified into a more practical and effective option to establish sustainability based on the “reduce”, “reuse”, and “recycle” (3R) principles. This review provides an overview of a wide range of existing SWM strategies with the following key objectives: (i) to comprehensively describe current technologies, strategic innovations, and monitoring tools, (ii) to provide an overview of prevailing waste management scenarios across different countries, (iii) to identify the roles of life cycle assessment (LCA) and other modeling tools in SWM, and (iv) to showcase feasible approaches for sustainable recycling and utilization of solid wastes. The current review finds that geographical positions and economic status of nations are important to dictate waste characteristics. A number of economic and LCA models have been described to facilitate future workers vis-à-vis organizations for the selection of appropriate waste management algorithms and for the evaluation of their eventual performance. In addition, this paper showcases various innovative solutions that have been reported for the achievement of smart and sustainable waste management plans in many countries.

AB  - As an extension to statistical techniques, fuzzy regression analysis estimates the relationship between fuzzy independent variables and non-fuzzy and/or fuzzy dependent variables. However, facing skewed or non-normal data may lead to vague results if the conventional least square models are used. However, there are many situations in applications of intelligence systems where regression components are fuzzy quantities instead of exact values. The present work is aimed to propose a fuzzy semi-parametric quantile regression model with fuzzy predictors, a fuzzy smooth function, exact coefficients and fuzzy responses. The proposed method is based on a new class of novel kernel-based signed-distance measures in space of fuzzy numbers. Main features of the proposed signed-distance including its robustness were studied. It was shown that the proposed signed-distance measure is more reasonable and effective than a common signed-distance which extensively has been used in fuzzy set theory. This is the reason why we decided to apply the proposed signed-distance to extend the classical quantile regression model. Then, a hybrid algorithm was suggested to evaluate optimal bandwidth, non-fuzzy regression coefficients and fuzzy smooth function at a specific quantile level. The proposed method was then compared with some common fuzzy regression models based on two data sets including a simulation study and an applied example. The numerical results clearly indicated that the proposed fuzzy semi-parametric quantile linear regression model performs better than the other available methods in terms of some common goodness-of-fit criteria in cases where the data set includes skewness and/or some outlier data point. The main advantages of the proposed method are as follows: 1-it is not so sensitive to the outlier data points and/or skewed data, 2- it possesses better fitting effect compared to other existing fuzzy regression models. Thus, the proposed quantile regression model could be successfully applied in many practical studies of fuzzy regression model in real-world applications.

AB  - The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method is a hot issue in industrial engineering field for it can help determine critical factors in complex system. Although lots of efforts have been spent on improving the DEMATEL, they are just the extensions from the subjective perspective but lack of the objective perspective. This study focuses on providing a new improved DEMATEL method based on both subjective experience and objective data. In order to reasonably determine the initial direct-relation (IDR) matrix, the basic probability assignment (BPA) function is employed to extract expert experience and the Dempster’s rule with Shafer’s discounting is employed to make combination to derive the subjective IDR matrix. Then the path analysis is suggested to test each possible influence relation included in the subjective IDR matrix, and the objective IDR matrix consisting of path coefficients of any two factors is derived by training the sample data of factors. Following the principle of one-vote negation, the Dempster’s rule is once again used to make combination for two kinds of IDR matrices, based on which an algorithm for the new improved DEMATEL is summarized to find the major factors in a complex system. Finally, numerical comparison and discussion are proposed to demonstrate the applicability and superiority of the prosed method.

AB  - In manufacturing systems where productivity is constrained by operators’ availability, cross-training strategies can be used to enable dynamic assignment of operators to workstations. However, finding an assignment approach that efficiently works under various system conditions is not trivial as, among other factors, the level of cross-training, the production duration and the initial conditions of the system can influence the assignment approach’s performance. To overcome this issue, in the case study presented in this paper, operator assignments have been modeled using a simulation-based optimization approach, with an “outer” optimizer that selects assignment-related parameters to simulate based on the system conditions, and an “inner” optimizer integrated with a simulation model that generates optimal assignments. For the case described here, which is modeled using a deterministic simulation model, the “outer” optimizer is an Ant Colony Optimizer (ACO) and the “inner” optimizer is a Binary Integer Programming (BIP) model. The ACO will select weights for the assignment objectives of the BIP multi-objective function so that throughput is maximized. The BIP is called by the system simulation model at fixed intervals or when a system status changes to assign operators to workstations. Results show that the simulation-based optimization approach generates higher throughput performance than static WIP-base assignment, especially when longer production duration are considered. The effects of cross-training and production duration on production throughput are also investigated. The simulation-optimization approach used can be abstracted to a framework where the “outer” and “inner” optimizers may be applied to different domains than the case study addressed here and can also be applied to stochastic simulation models.

AB  - Currently, no proper cost models are available to assist managers in selecting part-specific allocation strategies for spare parts under consideration of metal additive manufacturing (AM). Therefore, sustainability aspects and cost efficiency over a product lifecycle show potential for optimisation. The aim of this paper is to propose a two-stage model as a basis for decision support in spare part allocation. The first stage introduces a multi-criteria part classification regarding classical criteria as well as criteria referring to AM. The impacts on different spare part allocation strategies like final stockpiling, conventional spare part production or AM on demand will be focused. Based on the first stage, a conceptual model for a comprehensive activity-based cost assessment will be adopted to assess the arising costs that occur for each of the compared allocation strategies. Evaluating the relevant factors for the specific product, process, warehousing and capital issues, the basis for choosing the best suitable spare part allocation strategy will be presented. The present document is a working paper, where the interim results of the intended concept model are introduced.

AB  - Remanufacturing can restore the function of end of life (EoL) products as that of new products to realize waste utilization, which saves resources and reduces environmental pollution. So, remanufacturing is generally considered a promising way to foster cleaner production. Before an EoL product is recycled, its remanufacturability is first estimated to determine remanufacturing feasibility. Most researches on remanufacturability assessment (RA) are concentrated here, that evaluation of the whole machine or a certain type of product. However, after entering the remanufacturing system, the EoL product is disassembled into parts with various failure types and failure degree, of which the remanufacturability still need to be evaluated to determine their remanufacturing value. Currently, the research in this area are relatively lacking. In this paper, we provided a novel perspective to evaluate remanufacturability of parts based on multi-process routes, and further explored the application of RA in production decision-making. First, a RA model was established, which involves four key indicators, i.e., economic remanufacturability indicator (ERI), quality remanufacturability indicator (QRI), resource consumption indicator (RCI), and environmental emission indicator (EEI). Second, an integrated decision model was proposed with consideration of RA, and an improved genetic algorithm with a two-layer structure was designed to solve the optimal process plan and scheduling results. In the further case study of commercial engine remanufacturing, we evaluated the remanufacturability of parts and discussed the application of RA-based strategy in four production scenarios. Moreover, we compared RA-based strategy and quality grading strategy in real-life remanufacturing production. Results showed that multi-process routes based RA of parts can lead to more efficient and cleaner remanufacturing.

AB  - Assessing the value of local areas and cities, including examining the entrepreneurial, environmental, economic, and social dimensions of sustainability, has become key to fostering development. Such assessments can be conducted using a land-price function. This study analysed the land-price function using a geographically weighted regression model of land price, and explanatory variables related to entrepreneurial, environmental, economic, and social factors. To consider these factors, specific data scores were taken into account. A correlation analysis showed that six variables are essential for future value analyses: these are entrepreneurship, nature conservation, resource recycling, social vitality, the local government's financial viability, and environmental quality. Using these six variables to conduct preliminary regression analyses via four models, the study found that entrepreneurship, social vitality, and environmental quality have a positive impact on land prices in local areas and cities, while nature conservation, resource recycling, and the local government's financial viability have a negative impact. The result of a geographically weighted regression analysis showed that the areas around large cities in Japan have benefitted more from entrepreneurship and social vitality than have the areas around small and mid-sized cities. While large cities may be better equipped to promote environmental policies, small and mid-sized cities could promote entrepreneurship and social vitality policies using their environmental advantages.

AB  - The quest for economic growth has led to increase in world's energy consumption and to meet this continuously widening energy gap, high penetration of variable energy resources (VER) into the energy mix of countries all over the world is being encouraged. However, there is a limitation on the capacity of existing transmission facilities and the power system is more susceptible to voltage instability issues and the number of outages caused by voltage collapse has increased greatly. In this paper, a capacity factor based approach for optimal penetration of utility-scale PV solar power into the Nigerian power system considering voltage stability is discussed and compared with the line loss minimization approach. Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm on MATLAB® is used to compute sufficient capacity of solar PV that the power system can accommodate while maintaining the stability of the system. An additional constraint based on voltage stability margin is included to keep the system within the stability margin. The proposed approach with the added constraint is found to perform better for both line loss reduction and voltage stability improvement than the line loss minimization approach. Two optimization algorithms are used to verify the accuracy of the approach for techno-economic planning.

AB  - The Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) which is an extension of intuitionistic fuzzy set, is more capable of expressing and handling the uncertainty under uncertain environments, so that it was broadly applied in a variety of fields. Whereas, how to measure PFSs’ distance appropriately is still an open issue. It is well known that the square root of Jensen–Shannon divergence is a true metric in the probability distribution space which is a useful measure of distance. On account of this point, a novel divergence measure between PFSs is proposed by taking advantage of the Jensen–Shannon divergence in this paper, called as PFSJS distance. This is the first work to consider the divergence of PFSs for measuring the discrepancy of data from the perspective of the relative entropy. The new PFSJS distance measure has some desirable merits, in which it meets the distance measurement axiom and can better indicate the discrimination degree of PFSs. Then, numerical examples demonstrate that the PFSJS distance can avoid generating counter-intuitive results which is more feasible, reasonable and superior than existing distance measures. Additionally, a new algorithm based on the PFSJS distance measure is designed to solve the problems of medical diagnosis. By comparing the different methods in the medical diagnosis application, it is found that the new algorithm is as efficient as the other methods. These results prove that the proposed method is practical in dealing with the medical diagnosis problems.

AB  - Industry and academia shift from the single cloud provider paradigm to cloud federations and alternative models, which orchestrate heterogeneous resources, such as Mobile Edge Computing and Fog Computing. In such complex environments, incorrect selection of deployment platform can lead to underwhelming application performance. This dictates the necessity of Service Level Agreements (SLA) and trust management services in order to enforce performance guarantees and enable customers to simultaneously evaluate their application’s performance and give performance indicators for future provider selection. In this paper, we propose a collaborative SLA and Reputation-based Trust Management (RTM) solution for federated cloud environment. The SLA service defines clearly the performance metrics and measures the actual performance of the deployed cloud applications. Based on the SLA, the RTM service of the collaborative solution leverages several technical and user’s experience metrics to compute the reliability of the cloud providers and the credibility of the customers. A proof of concept of the collaborative solution in a realistic federated environment is provided and validated. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that it objectively computes the cloud providers’ reputation values under various scenarios.

AB  - Established under the European Union (EU), the thirty-year trans-national network, Natura 2000, is considered one of the largest biodiversity conservation frameworks worldwide. The global financial crisis has afflicted European economies since 2008 and has not only caused radical changes to the economic development but has also resulted in major implications on nature conservation activities in one of the weakest EU member states, however a biodiversity hotspot, Greece. The present research constitutes a broad-based assessment of the effects of the current economic crisis on the application of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives by the Greek state for the first time. By applying an expert elicitation method, Policy Delphi, we attempt to address the impact of the crisis on the administrative levels, competent authorities and procedural frames of the national protected area system, as perceived by 38 Greek key stakeholders and experts on the topic. An evaluation of the practices and obligations of 4 Management Bodies of the Greek protected area system was conducted to get an insight of the financial consequences on their operation. The structured and participatory approach followed in this study, allowed a systematic collection of experts’ transdisciplinary judgments on the state of the Greek Natura 2000 network in terms of implementation, management, administration, monitoring and legislation. With a strong tradition in managing its high nature value in a centralized way, in the face of the economic crisis, implementation challenges of the Greek state concerning Natura 2000 have been enlarged. According to a substantial part of the Greek conservation community that participated in the survey, many enforcement obstacles are considered, either direct or indirect consequences of the economic crisis, while some are inherent to the lack of a national comprehensive conservation strategy and not necessarily attributed to the austerity. However, the lack of national structural strength, as illustrated by the respondents, rather than the funding size proved to be an important cause of vulnerability for the Greek network. Based on the findings of this study we propose recommendations for improvements that align economic with conservation interests and measures that can substantially counteract the negative impacts of the economic austerity on the enforcement of nature conservation.

AB  - The use of renewable energies in the heating and cooling sector in Spanish households is a key strategy to improve the final energy consumption of the country. The main goal of this paper is to identify end-users’ decision making factors when making choices about heating and cooling systems, which is essential to deploy renewable energy technologies. Besides, this research analyses empirically the households’ awareness, perception and willingness to pay for renewable heating and cooling systems in Spain. To this aim, a survey was conducted and the responses were crossed with a set of socio-demographic parameters of the sampling, showing the influence of different population groups on them. Nowadays, 63% of respondents are familiarised with renewable energy technologies for heating and cooling uses in the Spanish residential sector. More than a half of those respondents who know any renewable energy technologies would pay more for them; the preferred technology is solar thermal energy, followed by biomass. To the best of our knowledge this is the first research in Spain with these characteristics and it provides a better understanding about how to deploy renewable technologies in the Spanish market and can be used for sectoral agents and policy planning purposes.

AB  - Supplier management is one of the complex, sensitive and multifaceted measures in supply chain that has the most effect on the successful performance of a supply chain. Selection, segmentation and development of the supplier are three important parts of supplier management. With globalization and increasing disruption and vulnerability of supply chain, the resilience of all components of supply chain is necessary. For this reason, the present study was conducted with consideration of two dimensions of resilience enhancer and resilience reducer to select and segment suppliers. The Grey DEMATEL technique was used to determine the importance degree of the criteria for each of these two dimensions, and then, using Grey Simple Additive Weighting technique (GSAW), the score of each supplier was determined according to each dimension. Based on the findings, customization was known the most important enhancer criterion and the supplier's capacity limit was the most significant reducer. Finally, vulnerable, sensitive, volatile and resilient suppliers were identified in accordance with the suppliers' score in both enhancer and reducer dimensions, and strategies were also provided for supplier development.

AB  - Multi-objective optimization in aerodynamics plays an important role in revealing trade-offs between conflicting objectives in order to discover important knowledge and insight for better future design. Of interest here is the use of Kriging surrogate models incorporated into a sequential Bayesian optimization (BO) strategy. In this paper, we studied four variants of multi-objective BO (MOBO) techniques that are based on expected improvement (EI), that is, Euclidean-based EI (EEI), expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI), ParEGO, and expected inverted penalty boundary intersection improvement (EIPBII) to understand their capabilities on handling multi-objective aerodynamic optimization problems. Numerical tests were performed on a set consisting of six generalized Schaffer problems (GSP), five low-fidelity, and one high-fidelity airfoil design problems. Results suggest that EHVI is the only method which consistently performed well on artificial and aerodynamic problems. EEI yields the worst performance and is not suitable to deal with various problem complexities. ParEGO, although it performs modestly on GSP, surprisingly works well on the low- and high-fidelity problems. On the other hand, EIPBII encounters the opposite case, where it is one of the best performer on GSP but yields modest performance on the aerodynamic problems. In light of the results, we suggest that EHVI is a highly potential MOBO method to be applied for multi-objective aerodynamic design optimization.

AB  - The lattice theory under the framework of formal concept analysis has brought mathematical thinking to knowledge representation and discovery. In this respect, this mathematical framework offers a conceptual knowledge representation through the Galois lattice. This hierarchical conceptual structure has been beneficial within the task of knowledge discovery in databases. However, its effective use in large datasets is always limited by the overwhelming number of extracted formal concepts. To select interesting formal concepts, the stability measure can be of valuable help. The dedicated literature has highlighted non-scalable approaches to compute such a stability measure. In an effort to tackle this issue, we introduce the Dfsp algorithm dedicated to efficiently compute the quality measure of the stability of formal concepts. We also show that the stability computation is an instantiation of a larger issue: locating minimal generators given the closed pattern as a reference point. The guiding idea of the Dfsp algorithm is to maximize as far as possible the quantity of the useless search space through the swift localization of maximal non-generator cliques. The experiments performed demonstrate the efficiency of the Dfsp algorithm.

The scenario that we address is a digital marketing content recommendation system, called campaign management, used by marketers to create specific digital content that can be issued or configured for viewing by certain population segments according to a series of business variables, user profile or behavior. Both batch mode and online update architectures are considered for feedback from the different contents displayed to users. The results show that possibilistic reward (PR) methods outperform other allocation strategies in this scenario with delayed rewards.

AB  - Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is an additive manufacturing process capable of producing mixed batches of parts simultaneously within a single build. The build orientation of a part in SLM is a key process parameter, affecting the build cost, time and quality, as well as batch size. Choosing an optimal arrangement of multiple heterogeneous parts inside the SLM machine also presents a challenging irregular bin packing problem. Since the two problems are interdependent, this paper addresses the combined problem of finding an optimal build orientation and two-dimensional irregular bin packing solution of a mixed batch of parts across identical SLM machines. We address this problem specifically in the context of low-volume high-variety (LVHV) production in the aerospace sector, using total build cost as the objective function. To solve this problem, we present an Iterative Tabu Search Procedure (ITSP), which consists of six distinct stages. We test each stage in the ITSP on 27 manually generated instances, based on 68 unique geometries ranging in convexity and size, including six real-life components from the aerospace industry. Two of the six stages, which are driven by support structure volume, returned the highest improvement in cost. Overall, the results showed an average cost improvement of 16.2% over the initial solution. The initial solution of the procedure was benchmarked against a commercial software, showing comparable results.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to evaluate the sustainability of operational logistics performance within a sample of OECD nations and to compare this to the most widely known national measure, the Logistics Performance Index (LPI), as developed by the World Bank. Data Envelopment Analysis is applied to derive an efficiency score reflecting the degree to which sustainable operational logistics performance (SOLP) is achieved within each sample nation. A comparison between the national rankings achieved under the LPI and SOLP evaluation regimes reveal that there is a statistically insignificant monotonic correlation between them. While one country may be a top performer with respect to one of the evaluation approaches, it does not emerge as such under the other. However, the results of the analysis suggest that logistics industries of the United States, the Netherlands, Norway and Australia are found to be top performers under both approaches, while that of Greece, Korea, Italy and Portugal are found to be poor performers under both. The paper concludes that the SOLP approach provides useful information that supplements that provided by the LPI, but that it better facilitates performance improvements within a nation's logistics industry by helping to identify the sources of inefficiency and the nations which possess benchmark performing logistics sectors.

AB  - Proper emergency evacuation planning is a key to ensure safety and efficiency of transportation networks in the event of approaching natural hazards. A sound evacuation plan can save human lives and avoid congestion. In order to develop effective emergency evacuation plans, this study presents a mixed-integer programming model that assigns individuals, including vulnerable population groups, to emergency shelters through evacuation routes during the available time periods. The objective of the mathematical model is to minimize the total travel time of individuals leaving an evacuation zone. Unlike many emergency evacuation models presented in the literature, the proposed mathematical model directly accounts for the effects of socio-demographic characteristics of evacuees, evacuation route characteristics, driving conditions, and traffic characteristics on the travel time of evacuees. An exact optimization approach and a set of heuristic approaches are applied to yield solutions for the developed model. The numerical experiments are conducted for emergency evacuation of Broward County (Florida, United States). The results show that the exact optimization approach cannot tackle the large-size problem instances. On the other hand, the proposed heuristic algorithms are able to provide good-quality solutions within a reasonable computational time. Therefore, the developed mathematical model and heuristic algorithms can further assist the appropriate agencies with efficient and timely emergency evacuation planning.

AB  - In the past decade, we have seen a massive growth in social networks and a day to day increase in their users. Loose constraints and almost no limitation in the propagation of information in these networks have resulted in a lot of false information, spam and inappropriate messages being exchanged among users. This has caused the creation of a trust crisis in which trust relationships turn into distrust. But, the real threat to the general integrity of social networks occurs when the removed trust edges in the social network result in more and more connections to turn into distrust and thus be removed from the corresponding trust network. This phenomenon is called cascading trust failure. The primary purpose of this research is to build upon the dynamic modeling of cascading failures due to the occurrence of a trust crisis within a unidirectional or bidirectional social network. After the model is created, the next step would be on the detection of neighboring edges that can be influenced by the trust crisis and may be removed because of it. The second purpose of the research is to propose a mitigation strategy for the prevention of cascading failures in trust relationships. This will be beneficial for the honest and free expression of opinions and experiences without their privacy getting compromised or the trust relationships being affected. The proposed model has four steps: (1) trust calculation and evaluation, (2) propagation, (3) updating and (4) the filtration process. In the model, important parameters such as changes in topology, cascading times and failure as well as the connectivity ratio are considered. The impact of these parameters is also investigated in the Facebook’s sparse network and Twitter’s ripple network. The performed evaluations show that the strength of trust relationships not only depend on profile similarity measures but also on the subjective, propagative, dynamic, event sensitive and the asymmetrical characteristics of trust. Also, it is shown that the sensitivity of users toward the change in their network topology is also a considerable factor in the occurrence and subsequent prevention of cascading trust failures. Based on the performed evaluations, the proposed mitigation strategy is capable of maintaining 95% and 92% of the trust relations when a trust crisis targets the highest trust values in the Facebook and Twitter’s networks respectively. This is a considerable increase from the 52% and 2% remaining edges in the occurrence of trust crisis in the previously proposed approaches. Also, the proposed approach has an average of 50% increase in reducing the number of cascading failures as well as their impact on the network.

AB  - Many alien plant species are introduced to urban areas to create, augment or restore ecosystem services (ES). However, many of these species spread beyond original plantings, sometimes causing negative effects on existing ES or creating novel ecosystem disservices (EDS). An understanding of the perceptions of urban residents regarding invasive alien plants (IAPs) and the ES and EDS they provide is needed for the effective prioritisation of IAP management efforts in cities. Using the city of Cape Town, South Africa as a case study, we conducted questionnaire-based surveys (online and face-to-face) to determine the perceptions of urban residents regarding IAPs and their capacity to provide ES and EDS. Most urban residents perceive IAPs negatively (i.e. agreeing that they create EDS), but many recognise their importance in providing ES. Although most residents are not opposed to the management of IAPs, such actions are not perceived as a high priority relative to other environmental problems. Socio-demographic variables such as age, education, environmental awareness, and ethnicity shape urban residents' perceptions of IAPs. Older, more educated respondents were more likely to perceive IAPs negatively, while respondents with greater environmental awareness were aware of the benefits provided by IAPs. This study highlights the need to integrate public perceptions into the planning and management of IAPs and emphasises the importance of including ES assessments into the decision-making process, particularly in urban areas.

The optimal number, location, and capacity of dry ports, and the optimal number of containers transferred through dry ports are determined with minimizing the economic costs and environmental and social impacts. Finally, numerical analyses indicate that the total network cost decrease about 1.14% with the proposed approach. Moreover, the MOMRPFP approach improves the efficiency about the average computational time for large-sized networks with the presence of uncertainty in flexible objective functions and constraints as well as in data.

AB  - Due to sustainability of wind energy, demands for this source of energy have increased rapidly. Strategic decisions such as determining the suitable location for wind plants can improve the feasibility of wind energy system projects. In this paper, a novel approach entailing data envelopment analysis (DEA) cross-efficiency and fuzzy-cross-efficiency models is proposed to find most suitable locations for wind plants establishment. Sustainability criteria are used as inputs and outputs of the presented approach. The developed method considers uncertainties associated with candidate locations efficiency value. The efficiency is defined as the ratio of weighted sum of outputs to that of inputs. A simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is applied to achieve a new ranking that has the lowest distance from the mean of all the available rankings obtained by the models. To evaluate the performance of the approach, a real case study in Iran is investigated. The numerical results show that the average values of efficiency obtained from the proposed aggressive and benevolent models are equal to 0.481 and 0.665, respectively. While, the obtained values for the deterministic aggressive and benevolent models are 0.491 and 0.609, respectively. Hence, fuzzy-cross-efficiency models provide lower and upper bounds for corresponding cross-efficiency models.

AB  - Accommodating populations in cities became increasingly a complex task. With the mounting local and global migration seeking better opportunities in cities, the current urban agendas has put forward compact cities as a promising solution towards sustainable urban development. Roof stacking is considered an approach towards increasing cities’ density. However, the selection of optimum roof stacking construction method is merely based on subjective evidence based on architects’ or owners requirements. There is an urgent need to identify sustainable criteria for decision making for roof stacking. Therefore, this research aimed to identify the influential criteria behind the selection and decision making on roof stacking methods. An intensive review of literature, individual interview, and pilot surveys have been carried out. A list of 37 sustainable criteria have been identified based on sustainability triple bottom line, i.e. environmental, economic, and social. A questionnaire has been design and distributed to architects and building engineers as active stakeholders. The importance of the identified criteria have been categorized and ranked. The outcomes of this research draws the line to develop a new tool that facilitates the construction of sustainable roofs in European cities.

AB  - Multipurpose platforms are innovative solutions to combine the sustainable exploitation of multiple marine resources. Among them, hybrid wind-wave systems stand out due to the multiple synergies between these two forms of marine renewable energy. The objective of this work is to develop a hybrid system for monopile substructures, which are currently the prevailing type of substructure for offshore wind turbines, and more specifically to focus on the wave energy converter sub-system, which consists in an oscillating water column. For this purpose, an in-depth experimental campaign was carried out using a 1:40 scale model of the wave energy converter sub-system and the monopile substructure, considering regular and irregular waves. Based on the experimental results the performance of the device and its interaction with the wave field were characterised – a fundamental step to fully understand the benefits and limitations of this hybrid wind-wave system, which sets the basis for its future development. Regarding the performance, the best efficiency was obtained with the turbine damping corresponding to a 0.5% orifice size, and two resonance peaks were identified (T = 9 and 6 s). As for the interaction of the hybrid system with the wave field, between 5% and 66% of the incident wave power is reflected and between 3% and 45%, transmitted. The wave period was found to be the parameter that most influenced wave run-up on the substructure. This characterisation of the behaviour of the hybrid system shows that it is indeed a promising option for further development.

AB  - Hash functions are a key component of many essential applications, ranging from compilers, databases or internet browsers to videogames or network devices. The same reduced set of functions are extensively used and have become “standard de facto” since they provide very efficient results in searches over unsorted sets. However, depending on the characteristics of the data being hashed, the overall performance of these non-cryptographic hash functions can vary dramatically, becoming a very common source of performance loss. Hash functions are difficult to design, they are extremely non-linear and counter-intuitive, and relationships among variables are often intricate and obscure. Surprisingly, very little scientific research is devoted to the design and experimental assessment of these widely used functions. In this work, in addition to performing an up-to-date comparison of state-of-the-art hash functions, we propose the use of evolutionary techniques for designing “ad hoc” non-cryptographic hash functions. Thus, genetic programming will be used to automatically design a tailor-made hash function that can be continuously evolved if needed, so that it is always adapted to real-world dynamic environments. To validate the proposed approach, we have compared several quality metrics for the generated functions and the most widely used non-cryptographic hash functions across eight different scenarios. The results of the evolved hash functions outperformed those of the non-cryptographic hash functions in most of the cases tested.

KW  - Hierarchical structure
AB  - Due to the growth of users’ requests for various resources in cloud computing, the optimal resource allocation is one of the most important challenges in cloud environments. The optimal resource allocation is achieved by considering user requirements stated in Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the Quality of Services (QoSs) provided by resources. Since some user requirements (objectives) conflict with some others, a optimal trade-off between them is required in the selection of resources. Obtaining such a trade-off is a complicated and NP-hard problem because we may come up with a lot of permutations (choices) of the resources with the desired QoS. If a cloud environment is geographically distributed, the problem becomes more complicated because in the geographically distributed cloud there are a lot of candidate datacenters with qualified resources. The user requirements considered in this paper are availability and reliability of resources should be maximized and resource cost and response time should be minimized as well as the minimization of the network traffic. The maximization of and the minimization of the requirements conflict with each other; therefore a trade-off between them is required. In this paper, a hierarchical structure with two resource selections methods called Simplex Linear Programming (SLP) Method and GrEA-based method are used where the hierarchical structure is used to present connections between distributed datacenters and the methods are used to select optimal resources among the datacenters. The most important feature of the hierarchical structure is to prevent the occurrence of an accumulation of requests in a datacenter leading to increase the rate of finding optimal VMs. Moreover, in most studies on geographically distributed clouds, one user requirement is considered for the optimal selection of resources; however, in this study, datacenters are selected based on 4 user requirements as well as the network traffic. Moreover, while in most studies, the requests for one user is considered at one time, this work does the requests for several users sent to the cloud simultaneously. Our results showed an optimal trade-off between user conflicting requirements and the resource utilization by 92%. Moreover, the performance indexes coverage ratio and the maximum spread indexes showed more performance compared to related studies.

AB  - Combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) systems have the advantages of higher energy efficiency and lower economic and environmental impacts (3E) than separated systems. Recently, optimization methods have been extensively applied in CCHP system's design and control for further improving 3E performances of CCHP systems. However, a wide range of subsystems selection, nonlinear characteristics of subsystem models and uncertainty in modeling results of CCHP systems cause challenges for successful implementation of optimization studies at both design and control stage. This paper presents a systematic review of all aspects of optimization for CCHP systems from problem formulation and algorithms selection to technical implementation. Genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and differential evolution are the most common algorithms used in system optimum design and control. Optimization works in design stage focus on optimization of energy source, prime mover, storage system, energy demand and system configuration. Over 60% of renewable energy integrated CCHP system adopted solar energy. More investigations are needed for small scale prime mover and economic is the development obstacle among 3E objectives. Dynamic characteristics and mal-distribution problem should earn more attention when optimizing storage system in CCHP. For the system control aspects, the baseline control strategy of load-following method as well as optimum control under real-time data and uncertainty condition are discussed. The intermittent feature of renewable energy should be considered at system control stage with uncertainty study. Uncertainty inside of energy demands, subsystems performance and market price should be investigated at the same time during control stage. Overall, this review paper can be used as an optimization reference and guidance for optimum CCHP system design and control.

AB  - Persuasion is a fundamental element of human interaction applied to both individuals and populations. Although persuasion is a well-studied, interdisciplinary field of research, this work advances its prescriptive, quantitative characterization, and future use. That is, this research complements the qualitative psychological literature with respect to the processing of persuasive messages by developing mathematical programming formulations to identify an optimal influence campaign. We adapt the classic Decision Analysis problem to a bilevel mathematical program, wherein a persuader has the opportunity to affect the environment prior to the decisionmaker’s choice. Thereby, we define a new class of problems for modeling persuasion. Utilizing Cumulative Prospect Theory as a descriptive framework of choice, we transform the persuasion problem to a single level mathematical programming formulation, adaptable to conditions of either risk or uncertainty. These generalized models allow for the malleability of prospects as well as Cumulative Prospect Theory parameters through persuasion update functions. We detail the literature that supports the quantification of such effects which, in turn, establishes that such update functions can be realized. Finally, the efficacy of the model is illustrated through three use cases under varying conditions of risk or uncertainty: the establishment of insurance policies, the construction of a legal defense, and the development of a public pension program.

AB  - Despite progress in many areas, the concrete industry still confronts challenges when it comes to the topic of concrete sustainability. Several evaluation methods have been proposed in response to these challenges, but the lack of a holistic framework for sustainable concrete material remains. In this paper, a holistic indicator framework for concrete material sustainability evaluation is developed by aggregating and analyzing the multitude of sustainable concrete material indicators into a causal network that reveals the indicators' interrelationships. A novel component of this framework is the integration of the two global perspectives on sustainable development: the pillars of sustainability (environment, economy, society) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These sustainability perspectives provide the framework with clear context to underpin the concept of sustainable concrete. A demonstration study validated the framework's applicability in evaluating the sustainability of various concrete mixes. The results highlight the importance of integrating both sustainability perspectives in elucidating the trade-offs that exist between the facets of sustainability and the priority areas needing attention to enhance concrete sustainability. These are critical information in the need to balance the different facets of sustainability, and therefore support the decision-making strategies for concrete sustainability.

KW  - GBEP sustainability indicators
AB  - The cultivation of marginal lands for bioenergy production has recently become a topic of research interest for the agronomic and agricultural economy scientific communities. The growing availability of arable land in the Mediterranean regions, as a consequence of the decline of cereal cropping systems and grain legume, provides ample opportunities for performing successful feedstock production on unmanaged areas. This paper seeks to capture and analyze ongoing and emerging questions concerning bioenergy production on marginal lands in the Mediterranean area in a framework of sustainability indicators. A qualitative methodology was adopted to evaluate the effectiveness of eight critical issues that bio-energy developers, scholars and policymakers should consider in terms of agronomic, techno-economic and methodological practices for growing bioenergy feedstock. The issues investigated on selected case studies are: Greenhouse gas emissions; soil quality; land restoration and phytoremediation capacity; water use and efficiency; biodiversity; land use/cover changes; farmers’ willingness and acceptance of new agro-system, and profitability of value chain. Starting from an in-depth analysis of the definition of marginal land from the perspective of ecosystem service cascade, we synthesize how these challenges are nowadays addressed and which are the key bottlenecks, trends and potential directions for guiding future research into bioenergy production in the Mediterranean regions. The findings of this study suggest that dedicated energy crops can be grown on marginal lands with substantial positive effects in terms of sustainability aspects, although more efforts should be carried out through agronomic research especially on water use efficiency and biodiversity conservation, as well as by national and EU institutions and policies for promoting economic opportunities and integration with surrounding agro-ecosystems and farmers’ involvement. Developing a site-specific landscape design with the use of Life Cycle Assessment and certification schemes with sustainability indicators is of primary importance for the effective bioenergy production on marginal lands.

This way we suggest the application of a group MCDA method to demonstrate how it may be used for aiding group decision-making in public sector. Aiming at analyzing the aforementioned problem, we simulate the choosing of the construction alternatives of Belo Monte Dam. The power plant project was marked by several conflicts among stakeholders due to the generation of diversified environmental, social and economic impacts. The results show that a group MCDA method may be used to aid public sector in the analysis of complex problems, by dividing them into several parts, allowing, therefore, a transparent decision-making process, as well as to solve gaps in the EIA methods.

AB  - Continuous urbanization, development of the economy, and the unrestrained exploitation and use of natural resources, the earth's ecosystems have been severely damaged by various types of frequently occurring natural and man-made disasters. Agricultural water and soil resources as a basic national strategic resources, a conflict is increasingly prominent between the available supply of and the increasing demand for these resources. Under such circumstances, the need for a quantitative diagnosis of the resilience of these types of has drawn increasing attention in China and abroad. A Technique for the Order of Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) evaluation model based on weighted Mahalanobis distance and gray relational analysis (MTS-GRA-TOPSIS) was proposed to evaluate the resilience of a combined regional agricultural water and soil resource (CRAWSR) system. For this purpose, a case study of the Jiansanjiang Administration of Agricultural Reclamation in Heilongjiang Province, China, was conducted. A total of 15 farms under its administration were used as evaluation objects, using information substitutability to screen out 12 indicators used to evaluate resilience. A MTS-GRA-TOPSIS model was used to evaluate the resilience rating of a CRAWSR system for 15 farms. The results show that the current resilience level of Jiansanjiang was rather low and that it should be improved. Specific countermeasures and suggestions were proposed, including increasing the utilization ratio of water and soil resources, returning farmland to forests, reducing groundwater use for agricultural irrigation, balancing the development of various industries, and improving the level of agricultural water conservation and mechanization. Verification of the rationality and reliability of the evaluation results obtained by the MTS-GRA-TOPSIS model was conducted which may be valuable for the formulation of related resource development strategies.

AB  - Tropical coastal areas are characterised by high levels of wind and solar resources with large potentials to be utilised for low-energy building design. This paper presents a multi-objective optimisation framework capable of evaluating cost-efficient and low-exergy coastal building designs considering the influence of the thermal breeze. An integrated dynamic simulation tool has been enhanced to consider the impacts of the sea-land breeze effect, aiming at potentiating natural cross-ventilation to improve occupant's thermal comfort and reduce cooling energy demand. Furthermore, the technological database considers a wide range of active and passive energy conservation measures. As a case study, a two-storey/two-flat detached social house located in the North-Pacific coast of Mexico has been investigated. The optimisation problem has considered the minimisation of: i. annual exergy consumption, ii. life cycle cost, and iii. thermal discomfort. Optimisation results have shown that adequate building orientation and window opening control to optimise the effects of the thermal breeze, combined with other passive and active strategies such as solar shading devices, an improved envelope's physical characteristics, and solar assisted air source heat pumps have provided the best performance under a limited budget. Compared to the baseline design, the closest to utopia design has increased thermal comfort by 93.8% and reduced exergy consumption by 10.3% whilst increasing the life cycle cost over the next 50 years by 18.5% (from US$39,864 to US$47,246). The importance of renewable generation incentives is further discussed as a counter effect measure for capital cost increase as well as unlocking currently high-cost low-exergy technologies.

AB  - Increasing concerns about environmental sustainability strategies, take-back laws and natural resource limitation has highlighted the impact of disposing end-of-life (EOL) electrical and electronic products. To cope with this challenge, manufacturers have integrated reverse logistics into their supply chain or chosen to outsource product recovery activities to third parties. This research studies the remanufacturing processes of reusable products and parts, cost and demand of remanufactured products and parts to determine return quality thresholds during multiple production period. We present a general framework for a third party remanufacturer, where the remanufacturer has the alternative of supplying parts to external suppliers or bringing the disassembled parts to ‘as new’ conditions. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, where with proposed discretization, the problem turns into a quadratic mixed integer programming (QMIP) problem. Finally, the impact of the quantity of returns, operational cost and upper bound disposal rate using a case numerical study of a personal computer (PC) remanufacturing facility has been studied.

AB  - Linguistic decision making is an important subject in decision making, many interesting and important linguistic decision making methods have been proposed, in which, alternatives-criteria decision matrix are uniformly used to express linguistic assessments of alternatives provided by decision makers with respect to criteria. Alternatives-criteria decision matrixes have some limitations when we use them to distinguish distinct, partial unknown or hesitant linguistic decision making or carry out linguistic decision making in the huge amounts of decision information and alternatives. In this paper, we propose alternatives-linguistic terms decision matrix to represent linguistic assessments of alternatives, analyze advantages of the decision matrix in representing linguistic assessments and distinguishing distinct, partial unknown or hesitant linguistic decision making. To simple and fast fuse alternatives-linguistic terms decision matrixes, we further provide linguistic multiset or fuzzy linguistic multiset to represent linguistic assessments in alternatives-linguistic terms decision matrixes, analyze the function properties of the fuzzy linguistic multiset. Motivated by fuzzy multiset and the TOPSIS method, we develop the fuzzy linguistic multiset TOPSIS method for linguistic decision making, the method is mainly consisted of transformation, aggregation and exploitation phases. In transformation phase, linguistic assessments of alternatives are transformed into fuzzy linguistic multisets by using alternatives-linguistic terms decision matrixes. In aggregation phase, we use Union, Intersection and Sum operations of multisets to obtain the positive and negative ideal solutions of linguistic decision making, which are different with the positive and negative ideal solutions of the traditional TOPSIS method, in addition, we provide a pseudo-distance between two fuzzy linguistic multisets to fast fuse linguistic assessments of alternatives. In exploitation phase, we define a new closeness degree of alternative by using pseudo-distances between the alternative and the positive and negative ideal solutions, which can be used to obtain the set of most satisfying alternatives. We also design an algorithm to carry out linguistic decision making based on the proposed method. In cases study, we use two practical examples to illustrate the practicality of the proposed method and compare it with the symbolic aggregation-based method, the hesitant fuzzy linguistic TOPSIS method, the hesitant fuzzy linguistic VIKOR method and the probabilistic linguistic term sets TOPSIS method, results indicate that alternatives-linguistic terms decision matrix and fuzzy linguistic multiset are alternative, useful and flexible tools for linguistic decision method and the fuzzy linguistic multiset TOPSIS method is suitable to deal with partial unknown or hesitant linguistic decision making.

AB  - Few years after the introduction of the first global regulation covering the energy efficiency of ships, this article analyzes status quo of the industry, based on the interplay of different technical measures such as ship age, size, propulsion, speed, and consumption as well as the policy benchmark of Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). This paper is one of the first to introduce a combined Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) approach. The analysis shows that the average vessel age of the most energy efficient cluster of 7 years correlates with the time period since EEDI introduction, thus indicating policy-driven environmental progress. At the same time, results suggest that further action is required. Higher stated energy efficiency is rather exhibited by a smaller part of the world fleet and by vessels characterized by higher commercial value. Two action fields are highlighted by the analysis: Firstly, the elevated role of know-how-transfer by promoting role models and first movers. Secondly, the need for alternative financing models due to significant upfront investments required by the industry to implement green technology and the long time periods between policy introduction and environmental results.

AB  - There are many studies on the sustainability of renewable energy, mainly focusing on energy supply, economic, social, environmental and technological aspects, but there are few studies on the sustainability of renewable energy itself. This work focuses on the systematic and quantitative assessment of the sustainability of renewable energy itself by analyzing the sustainability of renewable energy in selected 18 European countries from 2007 to 2016. The consumption of renewable energy in these selected 18 countries accounts for ~95% of the consumption of renewable energy in the European Union. To scientifically evaluate the sustainability of renewable energy, 17 indicators are selected based on the energy-economy-environment theory. In order to deal with the high-dimensional, non-normal, and nonlinear complex data, and to assess the sustainability of renewable energy without standards, the projection pursuit algorithm and the real-coded accelerating genetic algorithm are combined to establish a comprehensive model to assess the sustainability of renewable energy. The results show that (i) the sustainability of renewable energy in Germany, the UK, France, and Italy is better than that in the other investigated countries; (ii) in the 17 indicators selected by the energy-economy-environment model, the factors of total energy demand, energy taxes, carbon dioxide emissions, sulfur oxides emissions, and nitrous oxides emissions exert a stronger impact on the sustainability of renewable energy; (iii) time-series analysis show that the general sustainable level is a wave of growth. Moreover, the proposed comprehensive model can effectively deal with the high-dimensional, non-normal, and nonlinear complex data, thus providing a feasible method for the quantitative analysis and evaluation of the sustainability of renewable energy.

AB  - Sharing bicycle has attracted the most sharply increased attention throughout the world in recent years. Its rapid development has increased transportation convenience. However, abandoned bicycles have caused a waste of resources and environmental damage. Additionally, the negative effects will exceed the positive impact that sharing bicycle creates if these abandoned bicycles are handled improperly. This paper proposes a two-stage method to study the recycling of abandoned bicycles, including the selection of the third-party logistics suppliers (3 PLs) and the recycling network design. In the first stage, interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) and Vlse Kriterjumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) are used to select the 3 PLs. The dynamic time series, individual regrets, and group efficiency are all taken into account. In the second stage, From the perspective of maximizing overall benefits, a mathematical model considering the purchase cost of raw materials, transportation costs, recovery costs, and environmental benefits is established to design a recycling network. Finally, the applicability of the proposed method is numerically demonstrated by solving a real case, and key conclusions are that the recycling mode with the participation of the 3 PLs in sharing bicycle system is the most reasonable and feasible. However, in this mode, the selection criteria of the 3 PLs are different from other industries, which need to be given enough attention by the sharing bicycle operators. Additionally, in the recycling network design, considering the maximum overall interests of the three parties, the factory, the 3 PLs, and the operators, must coincide with the social philosophy of sustainable development. The results are of great guiding significance to the recycling of sharing bicycles.

AB  - Current building energy use is projected to increase by 1.7% annually until 2025, and the great potential for energy reduction in existing buildings has created opportunities in building energy retrofit projects. In this research, a framework and method are proposed to evaluate the impacts of different retrofit options to existing building under climate change. A Python retrofit tool is developed to perform parametric study by running EnergyPlus under different retrofit scenarios for existing buildings. With the help of Latin-hypercube sampling (LHS) method and a joint mutual information maximization (JMIM)-based feature selection method, the energy conservation measure (ECM) that may have the most potential in reducing the energy use or the lifecycle net present value (NPV) of a target existing building can be selected. A validated data-driven model is used to predict the building’s future hourly energy use based on EnergyPlus simulation results generated by future extreme year weather data. It is demonstrated that global climate change will alter the optimal solution of future ECM combination and its influence varies from building to building, location to location. The optimal retrofit strategy of selecting the best ECM combinations under current climate condition will be subject to change in the future climate condition.

AB  - How to estimate the urban land carrying capacity (ULCC)? Based on our previous research, this paper made improvements in two aspects: One is to subdivide land use types from four subspaces to seven subspaces (i.e. urban construction, industrial development, agricultural production, rural living, green ecological, other ecological and other subspaces), so as to distinguish more detailed the urban functional and spatial heterogeneities; the other is to reconstructing evaluation index system and estimate both maximum and appropriate population carrying capacities. The results demonstrate as follows: ① There is a significant difference between the population capacities in different types of subspaces. The urban construction and industrial development subspaces are the main carrier of population and economy. The agricultural production and rural living subspaces have low population capacities. The ecological protection and other subspaces have only a very low share of load. ② The appropriate and maximum population capacities of Shanghai metropolis are estimated to be approximately 20–23 million persons and 27–30 million persons, respectively, in 2009. There were 22.1028 million permanent residents of Shanghai in 2009, approaching the limit of the appropriate population capacity but lower than the limit of the maximum population capacity. ③ The methodology for estimation of maximum and appropriate ULCC in this paper not only gives the quantitative range, but also can provide the basis for growth control of urban population.

This study aims to identify and classify the various CSC from the views of affordable housing experts around the world. 21 CSC were identified from a comprehensive literature review followed by a questionnaire survey on the identified 21 CSC. With 51 responses, the data were analyzed. Factor analysis indicated that the various CSC can be grouped into six components: household satisfaction CSC, stakeholders' satisfaction CSC, house operation cost CSC, time measurement CSC, location affordability cost CSC and quality-related CSC. Practically, the findings of this study can serve as a guide for assessing the performance of affordable housing projects as well as serving as a guide to developers, NGOs and government agencies in the allocation of resources for the provision of sustainable affordable housing. Future study would investigate the interrelationship between critical success criteria and critical success factors for sustainable affordable housing.

For this purpose, five feature selection ranking methods including Bhattacharyya distance, entropy, receiver operating characteristic curve, t-test, and Wilcoxon are used in the proposed topology of HMM. Here, we presented a strategy for constructing, learning and inferring the HMM for gene selection, which led to higher performance in cancer classification. In this experiment, three publicly available microarray datasets including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leukemia cancer and prostate were used for evaluation. Results demonstrated the higher performance of the proposed HMM-based gene selection against Markov chain rank aggregation and using individual feature selection criterion, where applied to general classifiers. In conclusion, the proposed approach is a powerful procedure for combining different feature selection methods, which can be used for more robust classification in real world applications.

AB  - Multi-criteria group decision-making problems based on soft set theory have a paramount significance in decision analysis. In this article, we have concerned with the group decision-making problems with linguistic information based on the soft set framework. In this regard, firstly, we have introduced a new definition of a similarity measure for linguistic valued sets together with the proof of its axiomatic properties. Then, through the notion of linguistic scale function, the notion of the ranking function of an alternative in a linguistic valued soft set has been redefined. Additionally, the satisfaction level of a decision maker in a group decision-making problem has also been computed under the linguistic valued soft set. Finally, by utilizing the above-proposed ideas, we have provided a step-wise algorithm to deal with the linguistic valued soft set based multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems. This methodology has been clarified by a real-life-related problem regarding the plant location selection of a manufacturing company. The effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach have also been illustrated by providing a comparative analysis.

AB  - Background
The trade-off between efficiency and equity has been largely studied in the health economics literature and for countries with different types of health systems. Even if efficiency and equity are desired, it is not always feasible to attain both simultaneously. In Spain, the National Health System has historically been recognized for its universal access and free of charge provision, with good health outcomes. However, the recent increase in health expenditures together with the economic cycle has turned the orientation of health policy implementation towards efficiency, threatening universality and equity in the access to healthcare.
Methods
A Discrete Choice Experiment was carried out to weigh priorities of policy-makers from different regions in Spain. A total of 69 valid questionnaires were collected and the preferences towards equity and/or efficiency criteria were evaluated. Composite League Tables (CLTs) were used to rank hypothetical health interventions based on their attributes.
Results
The Spanish health policy-makers, managers and other stakeholder displayed a stronger preference for severity of disease, high individual benefits, a large number of beneficiaries and proven cost-effectiveness criteria in decision making. The priority interventions targeted severe mental disorders, i.e. major depressive disorders and suicides (or suicidal attempts), especially for young and middle age categories across the three regions under study.
Conclusion
In times of economic crisis, health policy-makers, managers and other stakeholder value, in moderation, efficiency over equity. The impact of austerity measures on populations’ socio-economic wellbeing seems correlated with the preference for mental health interventions.

AB  - The optimization of ship's subdivision arrangement is an important part of ship general layout design. However, optimization to an unmanned ship's subdivision considering the complex multi-objective is less studied. In this paper, the multi-objective optimization of a V-type non-ballasted water unmanned ship compartment division is investigated based on parametric model. The principal rules of cabin division for unmanned ship are determined first. The shape and composition of the longitudinal inner shell layout and transverse inner shell structure are studied by three-dimensional parametric representation method. The cabin capacity, bending moment and water immersion factor are used as the objective functions to establish the mathematical model. The improved multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are used to optimize the unmanned ship's subdivision arrangement in which the generated front-end solutions are normalized and sorted by the distance from the origin to solved the multiple objectives. The grey relational degree calculation method is applied to verify the method. Finally, different subdivision scheme based on different objective is given. The findings provide useful guidelines for the design optimization of non-ballast water unmanned ships.

The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is introduced to define the weight coefficients in the optimization equation for dynamic model updating, and a normalized model of weight coefficients is proposed. Finally, the mounting structure for example, the dynamic model updating is carried out based on the model experimental results. The comparison of the update results of the different weight coefficient parameters indicates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning is an inherently multi-criteria task. A multi-criteria workflow (MCW) typically passes the following steps: create an optimisation model with multiple criteria, approximate the Pareto frontier, and visualise the generated plans to the decision-maker (DM) for inspection. This interactive plan selection and manipulation allow to create better treatment plans as judged by physicians. However, once an optimisation model is specified, optimisation objectives cannot be modified any more. Thus this fixed model implies that a planner has to guess an appropriate model to begin with. Only after Pareto frontier approximation is calculated, the planner can assess the goodness of the model by exploring the trade-offs. The shortcoming of a MCW becomes apparent when the proposed model fails to generate expected trade-offs and the planner is thus forced to refine the model and repeat the calculations. To circumvent this drawback in the MCW, we propose a local multi-criteria workflow (L-MCW) designed and implemented in a collaboration between Fraunhofer ITWM and Varian Medical Systems. L-MCW enables local exploration around an initial, promising plan. The initial plan is automatically inferred by a knowledge-based algorithm (RapidPlan™). The decision-maker can thus evaluate trade-offs in the most interesting region surrounding the initial plan. Clinical results of the combination of knowledge-based planning and L-MCW with a cohort of Prostate and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) Lung cases demonstrate substantially reduced planning time and improved organ-at-risk sparing compared to manual planning. The L-MCW provides an intuitive and flexible mechanism to adapt knowledge-based-planning models to similar, but not identical clinical situations and allows the practitioner to quickly determine and realise the most beneficial trade-offs in a treatment plan.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative analysis of the outcomes achieved when two widely applied methods for supplier selection—the ‘technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution’ (TOPSIS) and ‘data envelopment analysis’—are applied to the problem of identifying the most preferred sustainable suppliers. Both fuzzy DEA and fuzzy TOPSIS are applied to a common dataset of logistics service providers in Sweden. The results reveal that TOPSIS outperforms DEA in terms of both calculation complexity and sensitivity to changes in the number of suppliers. However, output rankings from the two models are found to be less than perfectly correlated. The paper concludes that utilizing both methods, as applied to just a small number of evaluation criteria and a relatively low level of detail in the data, produces a useful pooled shortlist of potential sustainable suppliers. This can then form the basis for a second stage application where either of the methods may be applied to a greater number of criteria that are specified to a higher level of detail. Even more critically, the results also have the potential to point to specific aspects for discussion when negotiating price and service quality commitments with potential sustainable suppliers.

AB  - With the United Nations’ announcement of the 2030 sustainable development goals agenda, the electronic industry is striving to improve corporate sustainability performance. Studies have attempted to consider knowledge management to promote corporate sustainability performance. However, the possible linkages and potential benefits for bridging knowledge management and corporate sustainability performance are still lacking in previous discussions. To address this gap, this study proposes a hybrid method that integrates a fuzzy synthetic method with an analytical network process to develop an inter-dependent hierarchical framework. The results indicate that the relation, operation and economy aspects must align with the priority goal of achieving better corporate sustainability performance. Improvements of these aspects rely on the knowledge management of developing rigid external collaboration, adopting information technology-supported processes and expanding capital for developing knowledge management. This study contributes to (1) bridging knowledge management and corporate sustainability performance; (2) providing a hybrid method to develop a hierarchical framework; and (3) giving specific directions for guiding improvements. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

AB  - Controlling traffic flow on roads is an important traffic management task necessary to ensure a peaceful and safe environment for people. The number of cars on roads at any given time is always unknown. Type-2 fuzzy sets and neutrosophic sets play a vital role in dealing efficiently with such uncertainty. In this paper, a triangular interval type-2 Schweizer and Sklar weighted arithmetic (TIT2SSWA) operator and a triangular interval type-2 Schweizer and Sklar weighted geometric (TIT2SSWG) operator based on Schweizer and Sklar triangular norms have been studied, and the validity of these operators has been checked using a numerical example and extended to an interval neutrosophic environment by proposing interval neutrosophic Schweizer and Sklar weighted arithmetic (INSSWA) and interval neutrosophic Schweizer and Sklar weighted geometric (INSSWG) operators. Furthermore, their properties have been examined; some of the more important properties are examined in detail. Moreover, we proposed an improved score function for interval neutrosophic numbers (INNs) to control traffic flow that has been analyzed by identifying the junction that has more vehicles. This improved score function uses score values of triangular interval type-2 fuzzy numbers (TIT2FNs) and interval neutrosophic numbers.

AB  - Conceptually Cleaner Production seeks to integrate the continuous utilization of deterrent environmental approaches to processes, products and services aiming to rise efficiency and to minimize the risks to people and environment. Extant literature has shown that the implementation of Cleaner Production practices brings as a result economic and environmental gains. Nevertheless, very few studies link those savings to the Sustainable Development Goals, reason why this research aims to evaluate if the economic and environmental advantages coming from Cleaner Production adoption in the textile industry contributed to the Sustainable Development Goals. This was done through extensive review of the literature, complemented by the proposal of a theoretical framework confirmed through the development of two case studies. As a result, it was concluded that the adoption of Cleaner Production practices in Brazilian textile industries through technological innovation made it possible to highlight the economic and environmental gains relating those to Sustainable Development Goals 9, 12 and 15.

AB  - The running state of auxiliary equipment in power plants directly affects the economy and safety of power production, thus a data-based fault early warning method for auxiliary equipment is proposed. A multivariate state estimation technique with improved process memory matrixes is used to build the nonparametric model describing the normal state of the equipment. Different from the traditional process memory matrix, the improved process memory matrix utilizes the probability density equal interval sampling method to greatly increase the sampling density of the typical operating state and effectively cover the common working space. Instead of the traditional residual threshold method, the sliding window similarity of states is adopted as the evaluation criteria for early warning, which can better evaluate the normality of multiple fault-related variables in the state. This study takes a 300MW CFB power plant in China as an example, the proposed method are compared with the time series, fuzzy logic and traditional MSET methods. The result shows that the proposed strategy can most effectively predict the faults.

AB  - Identifying objectives is essential for decision making, but individuals have difficulties stating their important objectives. In public and environmental decisions, the diverse views of stakeholders should be included, but eliciting a broad set of objectives is challenging. We (1) study the effectiveness of individual brainstorming for eliciting objectives in a real-world setting; (2) test three interventions to support individuals in generating objectives; (3) investigate which and how many stakeholders are necessary to generate a comprehensive set of objectives; and (4) develop a feasible elicitation procedure for practice. In an experimental test, 71 stakeholders participated in five decisions about regional wastewater infrastructure planning in Switzerland. Three interventions were tested with an online survey procedure: (i) providing category cues, (ii) a perspective-taking task, and (iii) providing a predefined master list of objectives. In simple brainstorming, participants stated few objectives (M = 3.3) associated with 2.9 different categories on average. Participants consistently missed objectives they later considered important. Providing a master list was the only intervention that substantially increased the number and breadth of objectives (M = 12 objectives in M = 5.3 categories). With the help of our survey, participants generated between 30 and 38 distinct objectives for each decision case. Between five and nine participants were sufficient to generate these; more participants did not contribute new objectives. Most decision makers need help generating their objectives; combining simple brainstorming with a master list is a straightforward improvement that does not require a facilitator. An online process is promising for involving a large group of stakeholders.

AB  - Blockchain technology holds immense potential for industries and services by executing transactions in a verifiable and permanent way. It operates as an open distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties. However, the adoption and implementation of blockchain technologies in various industries and services is a challenging task. In this study, we develop a framework for investigating barriers to the adoption and successful implementation of blockchains across different industries and services, using DEMATEL technique. We identify these barriers with the help of extant literature and experts’ opinions and further classify them into ten broad categories. Then, we establish the causal relationships among those barriers and rank them based on their degree of prominence and relationships. We find that challenges in scalability and market-based risks are the most influencing barriers. Whereas high sustainability costs and poor economic behavior are the most influenced barriers during successful blockchain adoption. Finally, we perform a series of sensitivity analysis to test the robustness and generalizability of our proposed framework. Findings from our study will be beneficial for managers and help to eliminate the major barriers in the efficient implementation of blockchain technologies in their organizations.

AB  - This paper proposes a unified fuzzy data envelopment analysis model to address the optimization of switchgrass cultivation locations based on sustainable development indicators under epistemic uncertainty. In this study, each potential switchgrass cultivation location is considered as a decision making unit and a range-adjusted measure is utilized as a data envelopment analysis model for calculating the unified efficiency of each potential location for switchgrass cultivation and determining the most appropriate ones. By reason of the epistemic uncertainty associated with sustainable indicators, fuzzy set theory is incorporated in the proposed model. Inasmuch as the values of a number of indicators used in the model are in the form of possibility distributions, a new possibilistic programming approach is used for transforming the unified fuzzy data envelopment analysis model into an equivalent crisp one. The proposed model is verified and validated by comparing its results with those of the equivalent crisp one through performing a real case study in Iran at different levels of uncertainty. The computational results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model in determining the appropriate locations for switchgrass cultivation based on sustainable development and under uncertainty.

AB  - As circular economy and sustainability gain greater attention of governments, industry and academia, business model innovation for circularity and/or sustainability is becoming fundamental to sustain companies' competitive advantage. A variety of business model innovation approaches have been proposed to suit circular economy or sustainability principles. Although they largely have been addressed independently as two separate knowledge areas, there is an opportunity to seize synergies from the intersection of both streams. This paper provides a review of approaches for business model innovation for circular economy and/or sustainability, based on a systematic review of academic literature and practitioner-based methodologies. The systematic literature review identified 94 publications and 92 approaches (including conceptual models, methods or tools). The different approaches were categorized according to the business model innovation process, following a three stage dynamic capability view. Subsequently they were compared based on five characteristics (nature of data, boundaries of analysis, level of abstraction, time-based view, and representation style), to allow for a better understanding of how to use the approaches in research and practice. Based on the review, key findings outlining trends and a reflection about the interface of the scopes of circular economy-oriented and sustainability-oriented business model innovation are presented. Moreover, a number of gaps are identified and a framework that maps a future research agenda to simultaneously advance both streams is outlined.

AB  - The present work combines Concentration-Area (C-A) fractal model with the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) on a GIS platform for mapping gold potential in the Sonakhan Greenstone Belt, India. A set of stream sediment geochemical data obtained over a part of the study area was used to delineate potential regions of gold mineralisation. In order to develop a suitable predictive model, the gold exploration target was taken as target (dependent variable) and concentration of pathfinder elements of gold such as Au, As, Ag, Hg, Sb and Se in the stream sediments were used as predictors (independent variables). The C-A fractal model was applied to the geochemical data of each element to decompose anomaly and background components of the spatial dispersion of element concentration in the study area. AHP combined with fuzzy set theory (FAHP) was used to determine the priority or, the weight of each evidential geochemical anomaly map. The Gold exploration targets are delineated by multiplying the weights with the respective fuzzy normalised geochemical anomaly map of the gold pathfinder elements and integrating the weighted geochemical evidential layers using fuzzy Gamma operator. The reliability of the outcome was assured by the coincidence of known gold mineralisation with the potential regions delineated in the final gold potential map. The areas with high potential are good targets for detailed exploration of gold in the region. The results highlight that (a) application C-A fractal model can effectively separate geochemical anomalies as it considers the spatial variation of the data unlike the conventional statistical methods which account only the frequency of the data, (b) the FAHP allows more flexibility in judgements of multiple decision makers in a group and reduces the inconsistency of the result which is essentially required in the knowledge-driven predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity.

An in-depth review of the relevant literature and screening of determinants for selection of projects for exploitation of mines by seven experts led to the identification of 5 main factors and 19 corresponding sub-factors. A fuzzy hybrid quantitative approach consisting of Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Laboratory (FDEMATEL) and fuzzy Analytic Network process (FANP) techniques Known as FDANP technique was utilized to prioritize projects for exploitation of mines. “Scheduling project implementation” was the most permeable factor for selecting projects for exploitation of mines. It means that this factor is the main problem and could be solved with the help of the influential factors. The “costs” was the most influential factor for selecting projects for exploitation of mines.

Methods: A DCE was used on a convenience sample of participants from five European countries (England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain), exploring their preferences in distinct healthcare scenarios involving orphan drugs. A preliminary review of the empirical literature on distributive preferences informed the selection of attributes and their levels in the design. An online questionnaire was used to conduct the DCE survey. Results: A total of 199 questionnaires were completed. The five country model showed relative preference for some attributes over others: cost of treatment, improvement in health, value for money and availability of treatment alternatives received the greatest attention. However, disease severity, beginning of life, waiting times and side effects were also shown to be important social values that should not be ignored. Conclusions: The ﬁndings presented in this study provide insight about the preferences that can influence decisions on orphan drugs in different countries. This study also provides valuable prior information that could inform future DCE designs in this area.

AB  - This study proposed a bifacial photovoltaic thermal system (BPV/T) design. The two quality properties of electrical and thermal efficiency are important characteristics in the overall performance of the BPV/T. The relationship of the important parameters, including collector material, number of collectors, diameter, storage tank volume/surface area ratio, mass flow rate, cycle temperature, and azimuth angle, with respect to the quality characteristic of the BPV/T system was discussed. The Taguchi Method was used for the experimental plan, and the Transient System Simulation (TRNSYS) software was applied for theoretical simulation. At the same time, the Main Effect Analysis (MEA) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were combined to review the influence of setup parameters on the electrical and thermal efficiency. The single quality optimization setup parameter combinations were obtained. For objective multiple criteria analysis, the objective weights of electrical and thermal efficiency are obtained from the analytical data of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Afterwards, the Elimination Et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) will be employed to obtain the optimized parameter combinations for each season throughout the year. The practical validation is performed according to the multi-quality optimization setup parameter combination. The maximum errors in both the electrical and thermal efficiency between practical validation and simulation test are smaller than 4.3%. Then, the economic and footprint analysis of the BPV/T system was compared with both 1 kW photovoltaic (PV) and photovoltaic-thermal (PV/T) systems. Based on the 20-year warranty of the PV module, in terms of economic benefit, the BPV/T system is higher than the PV/T system by 18% and higher than PV by 460%. In terms of footprint analysis, BPV/T is less than PV and PV/T by 11%; however, the overall energy output per unit area of BPV/T is 20% and 210% higher than PV/T and PV, respectively. In the future, the optimized parameters and benefits analysis of the BPV/T system from this study will be further applied to the planning of solar energy technology as a point of reference for end users or industrial communities to accelerate the development of BPV/T for the renewable energy market.

AB  - Manufacturers are today striving to offer value-added Product Service System (PSS) with the purpose of achieving higher competiveness and more environmental benefits. Requirement elicitation and evaluation with sustainability concerns play a key role in a successful development of sustainable PSS. However, the previous literature rarely address the PSS requirement from the view of sustainability, while mainly focusing on the customer satisfaction. To accurately identify the requirement with respect to sustainable value from a long term perspective, it is necessary to develop effective methods for requirement elicitation for sustainable PSS. In addition, the prioritization of sustainable value requirement provides critical guidance for the later PSS design. The prioritization involves much judgement ambiguousness and diversity which may lead to inaccurate requirement analysis result. However, there are few researches on combinatory manipulation of the vagueness and diversity. Therefore, to solve these problems, an innovative methodology incorporating requirement elicitation and evaluation is developed for sustainable PSS. This study introduces the concept of value uncaptured into the identification of product value state, and offers the Product Value State Model (PVSM) method to elicit value requirements which help PSS deliver more sustainability. Moreover, a hybrid model for evaluating the sustainable value requirement is proposed by combining the fuzzy set, rough set, Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Analytical Network Process (ANP) methods. An application in an excavator PSS and the comparisons with some different methods demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the methodology. Theoretically, the proposed evaluation model provides more accurate and realistic analysis results of PSS requirements compared to traditional methods, since it supports to simultaneously manipulate judgement vagueness, group decision diversity, and complex interrelationship. In practical PSS design, the method helps PSS designers successfully recognize the most key value requirements with both respect of sustainability and customer satisfaction.

AB  - A sustainable business organization need to consider the importance of economic, environmental and social sustainability. Although researchers and practitioners focus their attention on the economic and environmental dimension of sustainability, less attention is paid to the social dimension of sustainability, particularly in developing countries. Nonetheless, these researchers and practitioners do not consider the social sustainability issue faced by freight transportation companies. To answer this issue, this article proposes a framework for computing social sustainability index, which is based on the freight transportation social sustainability enablers, dimensions, and attributes. To validate the proposed research framework, multiple freight transportation companies and eight industry experts were selected in the region of North India. Appropriate freight transport social sustainability enablers, dimensions, and attributes were identified based on literature and validated with multiple rounds of discussion with industry experts. The proposed framework considered four enablers, 16 dimensions, and 74 attributes including 17 new attributes of social sustainability. All the levels of social sustainability involve qualitativeness and incomplete information, so the fuzzy logic based methodology is more suitable to compute the overall social sustainability index. Freight transportation social sustainability index (FTSSI) has been computed as (4.472, 6.017, 7.591) and industry practices said to be “very socially sustainable”. Also, 21 poorer social sustainability attributes were found. The fuzzy logic based result was validated with the conventional crisp approach. The findings of the study will help transport industry managers, decision-makers, and government policymakers to take appropriate actions to improve the freight transport social sustainability performance attributes.

AB  - This paper presents an evaluation of energy supply strategies for Egypt’s power sector and identifies prospects to meet rising electricity demand while addressing energy security and low-carbon development issues. We apply the TIMES energy system model to examine Egypt’s energy policy goals as reflected in Egypt’s Vision 2030, and specifically: (a) targeted power generation based on renewable energy under two different scenarios; (b) targeted carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions’ mitigation toward low-carbon society development; and (c) constraints on natural gas production for power generation. The quantitative results from the model suggest a need for diversification from predominantly natural gas to a mix of renewable and conventional energy sources in order to improve energy security, reduce dependency on fossil fuels, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, with the level of diversification changing with different policy options. Although total energy system cost is projected to increase the effects on fossil-fuel dependency, diversity of energy supply-mix, marginal electricity generation price, and GHG mitigation indicate that it may be wise to target promotion of renewable energy for power generation and develop a low-carbon society.

AB  - Cold-bonded aggregates are technically feasible alternatives to conventional crushed stone aggregates (CSA) in concrete production, but the sustainability of cold-bonded aggregates has not yet been studied. Therefore, this paper suggests a framework for evaluating the sustainability of cold-bonded aggregates. The three pillars of sustainability, namely, social, environmental and economic factors, were used as the main criteria in the evaluation process. Cold-bonded aggregates made from waste materials such as fly ash and quarry dust were used in this study. The sustainability indices of cold-bonded fly ash aggregate (CBFAA) and cold-bonded quarry dust aggregates (CBQDA) were determined and compared with that of CSA. Fourteen sub-criteria were identified for this study. Out of the 14 sub-criteria, six sub-criteria were identified as social factors, another six were identified as environmental factors and two were identified as economic aspect factors. OF the 14 sub-criteria, eleven sub-criteria were qualitative in nature and three were quantitative. A qualitative assessment was conducted via a questionnaire survey of 254 registered practicing engineers. A quantitative evaluation of the embodied energy, lifecycle cost (LCC) and capital cost was performed in this study. The multi-index comprehensive analysis model was used to compute the sustainability indices of different types of coarse aggregates. The sustainable indices of CSA, CBFAA and CBQDA were found to be 0.610, 0.737 and 0.789, respectively. This result indicates that cold-bonded aggregates are sustainable and can be considered for used concrete production. The sensitivity analysis results indicated that the amount of binder and distance to the source of raw materials are important aspects. The framework developed in this study can be used to evaluate other building materials that are relatively new in origin.

AB  - System reliability optimization is a living problem, with solutions methodologies that have evolved with the advancements of mathematics, development of new engineering technology, and changes in management perspectives. In this paper, we consider the different types of system reliability optimization problems, including as examples, the redundancy allocation problem (RAP), the reliability allocation problem and the reliability-redundancy allocation problem (RRAP), and provide a flow of discussion and analysis on the evolution of the approaches for their solutions. We consider the development and advancement in the fields of operations research and optimization theory, which have allowed the formalization and continuous improvement of the methods and techniques to address reliability design problems of even very complex systems in different technological domains. Technological advances have naturally brought changes of perspectives in response to the needs, interests and priorities of the practical engineering world. The flow is organized in a structure of successive “Eras of Evolution,” namely the Era of Mathematical Programming, the Era of Pragmatism, the Era of Active Reliability Improvement. Insights, challenges and opportunities are highlighted.

AB  - Technology opportunity discovery (TOD), have evolved over time from technology forecasting to an approach based on existing technology capabilities for increased practicality. Unfortunately, TOD studies are still lacking, in that they do not consider the unique direction of the target firm in technology development or the recent trends of technological fields. Consequently, this paper proposes an improved methodology for identifying technology opportunities with less uncertainty by focusing on the target firm's dynamic change of focus technology fields. The proposed approach is as follows: 1) generate a sequence database, containing firms' dynamic change of focus technology fields; 2) explore the frequent sequential patterns from a precedence enterprise (PE) sequence database using the PrefixSpan algorithm to identify the technology candidates from a PE sequence similar with that of the target firm; and 3) evaluate the candidates on technological similarity, business stability, and recency. The results of the proposed approach are expected to help firms discover appropriate technology opportunities by considering both their existing technological capacities and the dynamic change of their focus technology fields. Furthermore, the proposed approach can identify the most appropriate technology opportunities with less uncertainty in real-life business environments by evaluating technological similarity, business stability, and recency.

AB  - Biochar production systems are regarded as one of the promising candidates to tackle the triple crisis of increasing energy demand, waste pileup, and climate change. Economics and environmental sustainability are essential indexes to evaluate biochar production. In this chapter, we have an overview of the economic and environmental analysis methods, that is, life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and their applications to the evaluation of biochar production systems. The products of biochar production systems are evaluated in terms of their economic and environmental impacts. The major factors associated with the carbon abatement potential and economic viability of biochar production are identified to guide the design of biochar production systems. The complication of biochar pricing systems is discussed with an emphasis on the balance between economics and carbon abatement. Finally, the cases of uncertainty analysis are introduced followed by the future development directions of LCA and CBA of biochar production systems.

AB  - The failure of critical infrastructure (CI) can be hazardous to the general population, the economy, and even national security. Disruption to one piece of the infrastructure often affects and causes failure of other dependent infrastructure, which may in turn affect the infrastructure in which the failure originated. These facts highlight the urgent need to understand the interdependencies among CIs to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of CI planning, design and operations. This research proposes a novel method to quantify and define the interdependencies among various components of CI and their priorities respectively, based on expert perspectives. The proposed method, named as Fuzzy-based DANP (FDANP), is a hybrid method that combines the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), Analytic Network Process (ANP), and fuzzy logic theory. The FDANP addresses the main issue in a complex network of CI interdependent and important components analysis, which is judged in multi-expert decision making circumstances. Numerical experiments that involve real case data from a former study were carried out to demonstrate the applicability of, and to validate, FDANP. FDANP is superior to the conventional method as it enables a more robust and sensitive exploration of both interdependence and priority in the CI and sub-sectors simultaneously. FDANP effectively captures the dynamics of various expert perceptions within the assessment processes, yielding a more robust analysis result. This research contributes to the evaluation of decision-making that is associated with CI governance, including protection planning, and managing the vulnerability of CI, as well as to increase the resilience of both CI systems and the communities that rely on them.

AB  - A probabilistic decoupled harmonic power flow technique was developed in order to scrutinize the probabilistic characteristics of a new techno-economic multi-objective model for hybrid harmonic filter planning, taking into account uncertainty in demand and the amount of injected harmonic currents by non-linear loads using an efficient two-point estimate method. In this study, the authors looked at four problem objectives: the total cost associated with allocated hybrid harmonic filters; and, the total harmonic distortion related to voltage, current, and transmission line loss arising from harmonics in the optimization. The newly developed model is a complicated large-scale non-linear mixed-integer optimization problem that makes use of a new multi-computational stage, multi-dimensional multiple-inhomogeneous melody search algorithm, or symphony orchestra search algorithm (SOSA), that is widely employed and followed by a fuzzy satisfying approach to determine the final optimal solution. This algorithm is a recently developed optimization technique by the authors, which imitates the musical procedures and interactive relationship among members of a symphony orchestra. The SOSA is organized by multiple-homogeneous and -inhomogeneous music players with a three-stage improvisation. The planning model has been applied on IEEE 18-bus, IEEE 69-bus and IEEE 123-bus distribution test networks to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB  - The enhancement of energy performance of buildings has become a pillar of energy policies. The main target is the cut of energy consumption to reduce buildings footprint. This aim is pursued by introducing constrains on building requirements in terms of properties of basic materials and components and exploitation of renewable energy sources. That results in the definition of the zero-energy building (ZEB) concept. The new paradigm introduced new challenges and, at the same time, involved all the different stakeholders in facing the barriers to the diffusion of the novel solutions proposed by the research development. This paper summarizes the actual state-of-art of whole performance of ZEBs and the related technical solutions, analysing their increasing potential in energy consumption. A collection of the different case studies reported in literature involving ZEBs is presented, compiling an analysis of the performance of the common solutions actually applied. The technologies involved are described discussing their impact in meeting the ZEB requirements. A debate is proposed, pointing out the main aspects deserving further investigations and outlining the critical elements in making the zero-energy target the new standard for the buildings.
