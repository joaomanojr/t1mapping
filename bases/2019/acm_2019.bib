abstract = {Recommender system is a well-known information system which can capture user tastes and produce item recommendations to the end users. Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) additionally take contexts (e.g., location, time, weather, etc) into consideration, and multi-criteria recommender systems (MCRS) utilize user preferences in multiple criteria to better generate recommendations. Both CARS and MCRS have been widely applied in the real-world applications, such as tourism, movies, music and dining. However, there are no existing research which exploits the methods to integrate them together, not to mention the contributions in the area of educational learning. In this paper, we make the first attempt to integrate context-awareness and multi-criteria decision making in the recommender systems by using the educational data as a case study. Our experimental results reveal that it is able to help produce more accurate recommendations by taking advantage of these two recommendation strategies. We also perform experiments on a tourism data set to demonstrate that the proposed methods can also be generalized to other domains.},

Data is available in large quantities, and it continues generating abundantly. However, not all the data will have valuable knowledge. Unreliable sources provide misleading and biased information, and even reliable sources could suffer from low data quality.In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for the selectability of data sources, by both considering the presence and the absence of users' preferences. The proposed model integrates multiple factors that affect the reliability of data sources, including their quality, gain, cost and coverage. Experimental results on real world data-sets, show its capability to find the subset of relevant and reliable sources with the lowest cost.},

abstract = {The growing needs of emerging applications has posed significant challenges for the design of optimized manycore systems. Network-on-Chip (NoC) enables the integration of a large number of processing elements (PEs) in a single die. To design optimized manycore systems, we need to establish suitable trade-offs among multiple objectives including power, performance, and thermal. Therefore, we consider multi-objective design space exploration (MO-DSE) problems arising in the design of NoC-enabled manycore systems: placement of PEs and communication links to optimize two or more objectives (e.g., latency, energy, and throughput). Existing algorithms to solve MO-DSE problems suffer from scalability and accuracy challenges as size of the design space and the number of objectives grow. In this paper, we propose a novel framework referred as Multi-Objective Optimistic Search (MOOS) that performs adaptive design space exploration using a data-driven model to improve the speed and accuracy of multi-objective design optimization process. We apply MOOS to design both 3D heterogeneous and homogeneous manycore systems using Rodinia, PARSEC, and SPLASH2 benchmark suites. We demonstrate that MOOS improves the speed of finding solutions compared to state-of-the-art methods by up to 13X while uncovering designs that are up to 20% better in terms of NoC. The optimized 3D manycore systems improve the EDP up to 38% when compared to 3D mesh-based designs optimized for the placement of PEs.},

abstract = {To avoid rewriting software code for new computer architectures and to take advantage of the extreme heterogeneous processing, communication and storage technologies, there is an urgent need for determining the right amount and type of specialization while making a heterogeneous system as programmable and flexible as possible. To enable both programmability and flexibility in the heterogeneous computing era, we propose a novel complex network inspired model of computation and efficient optimization algorithms for determining the optimal degree of parallelization from old software code. This mathematical framework allows us to determine the required number and type of processing elements, the amount and type of deep memory hierarchy, and the degree of reconfiguration for the communication infrastructure, thus opening new avenues to performance and energy efficiency. Our framework enables heterogeneous manycore systems to autonomously adapt from traditional switching techniques to network coding strategies in order to sustain on-chip communication in the order of terabytes. While this new programming model enables the design of self-programmable autonomous heterogeneous manycore systems, a number of open challenges will be discussed.},

abstract = {Under the background of the national policy of promoting agriculture through science and technology, agricultural high-tech are emerging continuously. How to evaluate these technologies objectively and efficiently to help enterprises make decisions is of great significance to promote the industrialization of technologies. To solve problems in traditional evaluation process,such as the lag of evaluation method, the subjective influence of experts, time consuming, labor consuming and low efficiency, an intelligent comprehensive evaluation method based on machine learning was proposed. To establish a hierarchical evaluation index system using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the index system is firstly quantified, and then 25 agricultural high-tech in different fields are selected and scored by experts; To build BP Neural Network model, the data obtained from experts' experience are selected as samples to train the model, achieve the intelligent comprehensive evaluation and calculation of agricultural high-tech. The experiment proves that compared with the Support Vector Machine(SVM) model, the absolute error between the output value and the real value obtained by BP Neural Network(BP-NN) model is within the range of (-0.06~0.08), the average relative error is 0.0265%. It can be seen that BP Neural Network applied to the comprehensive evaluation of agricultural high-tech is with high accuracy and simple usage, and can meet the requirements of agricultural high-tech comprehensive evaluation.},

abstract = {In the last decades, many researches provided many solutions, methods and models for solving vehicle routing problem (VRP). However, they offer no reliable solution for dealing with important numbers of instances. For such a case, we already gave an algorithm using skylines to solve the VRP problem. The algorithm first determines all feasible routes with their respective costs vectors, and then the vectors are passed to the skyline operator to yield the best routes. In our previous work presenting this algorithm, we mainly focused on the novel idea on how to use skylines if such vectors are provided. In this paper, we first give a state of the art for some methods solving the vehicle routing problem. Secondly, we investigate the details regarding the first step of our algorithm regarding the determination of all feasible solutions with their associated costs vectors. We step by step consider all possible combinations of routes and reject the useless routes according to the user's needs (e.g., limited cost, limited time, limited capacity). The feasible combinations for the problem are finally passed to the skyline operator. All steps of our algorithm are illustrated through simulation examples.},

MCDM methods are proposed as a solution of financial fraud detection (FFD) problems.

abstract = {When faced with a database containing millions of tuples, an end user might be only interested in finding his/her (close to) favorite tuple in the database. Recently, a regret minimization query was proposed to obtain a small subset from the database that fits the user's needs, which are expressed through an unknown utility function. Specifically, it minimizes the "regret'' level of a user, which we quantify as the regret ratio if s/he gets the best tuple in the selected subset but not the best tuple among all tuples in the database. We study how to enhance the regret minimization query with user interactions : when presented with a small number of tuples (which can be artificial tuples or true tuples inside the database), a user is asked to indicate the tuple s/he favors the most among them. In particular, we are also interested in the special case of determining the favorite tuple for a user in the entire database with a small amount of interaction, measured by the number of questions we ask the user. Different from the previous work which displays artificial tuples to users, we achieve a stronger result in this paper by always displaying true tuples in the database. Specifically, we present a generic framework for interactive regret minimization, under which we propose algorithms that ask an asymptotically optimal number of questions in 2-dimensional spaces and algorithms with provable performance guarantees in d-dimensional spaces ($d geq 2$) where each dimension corresponds to a description of a tuple. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets showed that our algorithms outperform the existing one by locating the favorite tuple and guaranteeing a small regret ratiowith much fewer questions.},

abstract = {Currently, there are rapid changes in the supermarket sector, as more and more companies provide home delivery services of most of their products. Recently, perishable groceries are also directly shipped to people's home, which leads to new logistical challenges. By only using statistical data known as location factors, problems arose for metropolises like Berlin. These cities have several millions of inhabitants, but are only modeled as one geographic entity with a single attributes like average net income. In order to provide insights into cities down to street level, this geodata model was enriched with information of OpenStreetMap (OSM). Additionally, the road network of OSM was used to dynamically calculate catchment areas and combine them with location factors of the geodata model. This combination enables dynamic and data-driven customer, competitor, and supplier analysis. The evaluation was performed on the application scenario of online food delivery models of Edeka, Rewe and Amazon-Fresh. The results indicate, that Edeka's delivery model-currently evaluated by Edeka in Berlin-only reaches 0,28 % of the inhabitants, whereas Amazon fresh achieves nearly 100 % coverage. As a conclusion, the presented data-driven business analysis enables new possibilities for site selection and potential for future applications.},

However, previously proposed multi-criteria models did not take into account latent embeddings generated from user reviews, which capture latent semantic relations between users and items. To address these concerns, we utilize variational autoencoders to map user reviews into latent embeddings, which are subsequently compressed into low-dimensional discrete vectors. The resulting compressed vectors constitute latent multi-criteria ratings that we use for the recommendation purposes via standard multi-criteria recommendation methods. We show that the proposed latent multi-criteria rating approach outperforms several baselines significantly and consistently across different datasets and performance evaluation measures.},

However, instead of replacing human relationships they should help build them within a person's most natural social circles. This paper presents a framework for development of a technological coaching solution that can safeguard or even boost the everyday social life of the elderly. The modus operandi of this system spans from unobtrusive data collection through data processing and situation assessment of social behaviour, to selection and rendering of the most appropriate coaching actions to the elderly person including through members of their social circles. The assessment and decision-making process also integrates three important groups of external factors which influence the solution. These are: (i) personal profiles of the elderly and those members of the social circles who participate in the coaching process; (ii) objective external environment and (iii) the quality of the coaching actions. The latter is a crucial element of the system's learning abilities.},

While some components have seen more advancements than others, more research is required before effective autonomous MAS can be deployed in real smart city settings that are less restrictive than the assumed validation environments of MAS.

abstract = {[<u>Context/Motivation</u>] Decision-making for self-adaptive systems (SAS) requires the runtime trade-off of multiple non-functional requirements (NFRs) and the costs-benefits analysis of the alternative solutions. Usually, it is required the specification of the weights (a.k.a. preferences) associated with the NFRs and decision-making strategies. These preferences are traditionally defined at design-time. [<u>Questions/Problems</u>] A big challenge is the need to deal with unsuitable preferences, based on empirical evidence available at runtime, and which may not agree anymore with previous assumptions. Therefore, new techniques are needed to systematically reassess the current preferences according to empirical evidence collected at runtime. [<u>Principal ideas/ results</u>] We present ARRoW (<u>A</u>utomatic <u>R</u>untime <u>R</u>eappraisal <u>o</u>f <u>W</u>eights) to support the dynamic update of preferences/weights associated with the NFRs and decision-making strategies in SAS, while taking into account the current levels of satisficement that NFRs can reach during the system's operation. [<u>Contribution</u>] To developed ARRoW, we have extended the Primitive Cognitive Network Process (P-CNP), a version of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), to enable the handling and update of weights during runtime. Specifically, in this paper, we show a formalization for the specification of the decision-making of a SAS in terms of NFRs, the design decisions and their corresponding weights as a P-CNP problem. We also report on how the P-CNP has been extended to be used at runtime. We show how the propagation of elements of P-CNP matrices is performed in such a way that the weights are updated to therefore, improve the levels of satisficement of the NFRs to better match the current environment during runtime. ARRoW leverages the Bayesian learning process underneath, which on the other hand, provides the mechanism to get access to evidence about the levels of satisficement of the NFRs. The experiments have been applied to a case study of the networking application domain where the decision-making has been improved.},

abstract = {The urban traffic system is one of the most critical infrastructures. It can be abstracted into a complex network composed of strongly connected groups. Understanding the composition of such networks requires a decomposition of the network into modules, taking into account the way in which network links are distributed among the nodes, which is not an easy task. In such networks, there generally exists for each set of highly interlinked nodes little connectivity with the next set of highly interlinked nodes. This property of nodes makes community detection an important approach for analyzing the structure of complex networks. Today the emerging of big data traffic and the growing availability of smart connected devices [1] such as GPS and other sensors contribute a lot to defining the daily travel activity of individuals and giving a description for the spatial structure of travel modes in a city. In this paper, we propose a solution for exploiting urban big data traffic collected from smart devices, in order to make it available for high level applications. This will be achieved by identifying the underlying structures of the vehicles, the travellers and the stations networks and detecting the multi-layer communities in these networks. We present a global architecture for an intelligent transport network with some details of each its components. The main contribution of the proposed architecture is the Community Analysis component, which allows us to analyse communities with different types of nodes: travelers with their preferences, public transport stations and public vehicles. Then using the community detection method and the network analysis method, we present one application of the proposed system that is related to public transportation optimization. To take into account travelers' preferences, we propose a traveler's profile model and we show how it can help to detect travelers' communities.},

abstract = {Governments are currently confronting major challenges such as financial, economic and spending crises, impending resource shortages, migratory pressures and climate change. At the same time, policymakers are required to be more inclusive and to co-create policy with stakeholders. Policies must address the complexity of a situation in a holistic way, rather than propose solutions to single problems. Therefore, formulating and understanding the situation and its complex dynamics is key in finding holistic solutions. This indicates a systems approach to policy analysis that is integrative and inter-subjective. There is a need to develop robust, intuitive decision support tools that provide an environment for model-based collaborative governance. These tools should enable multiple policy actors to: (i) build and share a mental model of the problem under analysis; (ii) design policy options, each structured as a particular combination of various types of policy instruments, and assess the likely impacts of a policy option in terms of the economic, financial, social, environmental and other impacts; and (iii) conduct an in-depth evaluation of competing policy options, taking into account the preferences of policymakers and stakeholder groups. A new policy-oriented quantitative problem structuring method that is facilitated by decision support system (DSS) technologies is a novel research opportunity that was explored in the SENSE4US research project, which designed and demonstrated systems modelling, simulation and decision analysis tools for prescriptive policy analysis. This paper reports on the results of that research project and provides a reflection on the contributions of this research to theory and practice and what areas further research can take place in the future.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science have become one of the most popular curricula in the computing educations. Plenty of theories, optimizations and math are involved in these courses, which results in a higher degree of difficulty for students to learn, not to mention the students without specializations in computer science or information technology. Beyond the complicated knowledge and theories, students may prefer to learn and focus on applied AI or data science which refer to the knowledge or skills for practical problem-solving and real-world applications. For example, information retrieval has been listed as one of the curricula in several undergraduate and/or graduate programs in the AI or data science programs. This paper describes a course that focuses on the topic of recommender systems which is in high demand in both academia and industries. This course has been extremely successful at the authors' institutions. In this paper, we introduce the course's objectives, structure and methodologies, discuss possible ways to deliver hands-on practice, summarize the outcomes, and finally present the lessons learned, as well as the feedbacks from the students. These experience could be useful and may give advice to other educators looking to create a similar course in their program.},
