AB  - Manufacturing processes are becoming increasingly complex. In order to stay competitive, speeding up knowledge generation about the processes, products and their interdependencies is necessary. Digitalization and data analytics provide the required toolset to uncover hidden relations within data. Since it is not feasible to collect and store all data generated within large scale manufacturing, data analytics projects, which are initiated reactively to solve existing manufacturing problems, are often limited by the existing data and resources. Hence, required data as well as the IT infrastructure have to be designed for data analytics. Therefore, proactive specification of relevant use cases and their prioritization during early development phases of the manufacturing system is necessary. Due to synergies within the data, the use case prioritization is a complex multicriteria combinatorial problem. This paper presents an approach to solve this problem by means of optimization. In the given example, a 28% more cost effective solution over existing prioritization methods was achieved.

AB  - The environmental and social impacts of products are being increasingly scrutinized. This necessitates systematic assessment methods. Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) provides a framework to addresses diverse sustainability issues over the product's life cycle, but its application is complicated. Major challenges, such as the selection of relevant indicators, multi-criteria comparisons of alternatives, the treatment of uncertainties, or the integration of spatially differentiated data, can be facilitated by adopting advanced analytical methods from Operations Research. This paper reviews 142 articles that use Operations Research methods for product-related sustainability assessments. The articles were selected from peer-reviewed scientific literature in a systematic search and screening process. Descriptive analysis shows that related publication output is growing over time and originates mainly in journals related to Environmental Management. While ecological indicators are considered by most articles, the integration of economic and social indicators is emerging. Focusing on the contributions of Operations Research, a detailed analysis shows that more than half of the articles adopt methods from Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM), followed by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Multi-Objective Decision Making (MODM). Uncertainties with regard to inventory data and decision makers’ preferences are addressed using fuzzy logic, stochastic models, or sensitivity analysis. The use of spatially differentiated data is not frequently found in the reviewed articles. Research needs derived from this analysis comprise the integration of qualitative and semi-quantitative (social) indicators, the simultaneous consideration of global and local sustainability objectives, and the application of systematic procedures to address uncertainty.

AB  - Drone has become an important buzzword in the logistics sector in recent times. Drone deliveries have a two-pronged advantage as they have the potential to lessen delivery time by avoiding traffic congestions, and the inherent structure that reduces its carbon footprint compared to traditional modes of transportation under some restrictions. To leverage this potential, many companies across the world have developed and tested drones for real-world applications. However, many factors may play a significant role in the adoption of drone-delivery in the logistics sector. This paper attempts to unearth such critical success factors and establish the interrelationships between these factors. Twelve critical success factors were identified by systematically reviewing the literature and taking inputs from experts. An integrated multi-criteria decision-making technique, decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)’, combined with the Grey-based approach, was used to envisage causal relationships between the identified critical success factors. The results reveal that ‘Technological advancements’ and ‘Government regulations’ are the most influential factors that impact the adoption of drones in the logistics sector. The research implications of these findings will help practitioners and policymakers effectively implement drones in the logistics sector.

Fourteen CSFs were shortlisted by reviewing the literature and considering expert team inputs. To explore the mutual influence between the identified CSFs the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) approach was applied. To strengthen link interpretation, ISM methodology was supported by the Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) approach. Further, to identify the factors with high driving power the Matrice d’Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliqués à un Classement (MICMAC) analysis was employed. It was concluded that three CSFs namely, ‘top management commitment’ ‘lean support,’ and ‘optimized inventory management’ were the critical ones with high influential power.

AB  - The conventional approach of selecting HVAC systems is based on a designer's knowledge and experience, and this may lead to flawed decisions. The ever-growing accumulation of building performance data makes the machine learning algorithm based HVAC system selection possible. This study presents an innovative approach wherein the Bayesian Network technique is applied to select the most energy efficient primary HVAC systems. The database upon which the approach is developed is the 2012 Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). The first step of this research involves clustering a group of similar buildings for the target building. Euclidean distance is adopted to calculate the similarity of a building with the target building. In the meantime, a survey is carried out to investigate the major factors that designers considered when selecting the primary HVAC system. The survey results show that climate zone, design cooling/heating load, and principal activity type are three main factors considered by designers and only 13% designers value the building energy consumption. In this study, all factors that could potentially influence the HVAC system's energy consumption are used to construct the directed acyclic graph of the proposed Bayesian Network Classifier. This classifier is trained with high energy efficient buildings data after the filtering out of irrational outliers. Then, the trained classifier is applied to select the primary cooling systems for three case buildings. The results indicate that the selected systems coincide with common HVAC design logic. The proposed method provides designers with an innovative approach to select energy efficient HVAC systems by using the data of hundreds of high energy efficient buildings. This study demonstrates the feasibility and capability of data-driven building design.

AB  - Coal is an irreplaceable part of the world energy structure and the condition will not be changed in the near future. Under the Belt and Road initiative, more and more Chinese energy enterprises are planning to invest in coal-fired power plant (CFPP) abroad. However, there are multiple potential risks in investing in CFPP overseas. So, assessing the risk level can help the investors avoid too risky countries and at the same time facilitate the government to take measures to reduce the potential risks to attract more investors. To reasonably assess overseas investment risk of CFPP in countries along the Belt and Road initiative, this paper establishes an evaluation criteria system from eight dimensions which consists of a total of 39 criteria. Then, these criteria weights are determined through a combined analytic network process-Entropy method. Furthermore, considering the psychological characteristics of decision-makers, a TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive Multi-criteria Decision Making) approach is used to rank the overall risk level of CFPP investment for 23 nations. The findings indicate that the criterion of economic foundation owns the largest weight. Moreover, among these evaluated nations, Singapore have the lowest risk for China’s CFPP investment, followed by New Zealand and Thailand.

AB  - Floods, as a catastrophic phenomenon, have a profound impact on ecosystems and human life. Modeling flood susceptibility in watersheds and reducing the damages caused by flooding is an important component of environmental and water management. The current study employs two new algorithms for the first time in flood susceptibility analysis, namely multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA), and classification and regression trees (CART), incorporated with a widely used algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM), to create a flood susceptibility map using an ensemble modeling approach. A flood susceptibility map was developed using these models along with a flood inventory map and flood conditioning factors (including altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, distance from river, topographic wetness index, drainage density, soil depth, soil hydrological groups, land use, and lithology). The case study area was the Khiyav-Chai watershed in Iran. To ensure a more accurate ensemble model, this study proposed a framework for flood susceptibility assessment where only those models with an accuracy of >80% were permissible for use in ensemble modeling. The relative importance of factors was determined using the Jackknife test. Results indicated that the MDA model had the highest predictive accuracy (89%), followed by the SVM (88%) and CART (0.83%) models. Sensitivity analysis showed that slope percent, drainage density, and distance from river were the most important factors in flood susceptibility mapping. The ensemble modeling approach indicated that residential areas at the outlet of the watershed were very susceptible to flooding, and that these areas should, therefore, be prioritized for the prevention and remediation of floods.

AB  - Flash-flood is considered to be one of the most destructive natural hazards in the world, which is difficult to accurately model and predict. The objective of the present research is to propose new ensembles of bivariate statistics and artificial intelligences and to introduce a comprehensive methodology for predicting flood susceptibility. The Putna river catchment of Romania is selected as a case study. In this regard, a total of six ensemble models were proposed and verified: Multilayer Perceptron neural network-Frequency Ratio (MLP-FR), Multilayer Perceptron neural network -Weights of Evidence (MLP-WOE), Rotation Forest-Frequency Ratio (RF-FR), Rotation Forest-Weights of Evidence (RF-WOE), Classification and Regression Tree-Frequency Ratio (CART-FR), and Classification and Regression Tree-Weights of Evidence (CART-WOE). In a first step, a geospatial database was created for the study area. This database includes 132 flood locations and 14 conditioning factors (lithology, slope angle, plan curvature, hydrological soil group, topographic wetness index, landuse, convergence index, elevation, distance from river, profile curvature, rainfall, aspect, stream power index, and topographic position index). In the next step, the Information Gain Ratio was used to evaluate the predictive ability of these factors. Subsequently, the database was used to train and validate the six ensemble models. The Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), and statistical measures were used to evaluate the performance of the models. The results show that the prediction capability of the proposed ensemble models varied from 86.8% (the RF-FR model) to 93.9% (the RF-WOE model). These values indicate a high prediction performance for all the models. Therefore, we can state that the proposed ensemble models are new reliable tools which can be used for flood susceptibility modelling.

AB  - In recent decades, researchers have proposed different boosting algorithms to improve the learning abilities of classification techniques for imbalanced data. Especially for the SVM, Wang et al. (2010) proposed a cost-sensitive boosting algorithm, named Wang’s Boosted SVM (WBSVM). In this study we made two major modifications to WBSVM algorithm to improve the classification performance without increasing its existing time complexity (O(n3)): (i) a distance-based weight-update rule (ii) a sign based classifier removal technique to obtain a performance enhanced classifier ensemble. We used 43 imbalanced benchmark datasets to assess the performance. The results revealed that both the modifications made a significant improvement in the boosting performance. Also, we compared our modified Boosted SVM (MBSVM) performance with K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network and one of the deep learning techniques – Deep Neural Network performances. We also developed a framework to construct Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for Boosted SVM. We compared both the boosted SVMs with Area under the ROC curve (AUC) values and also in terms of running time of algorithms. Furthermore, MBSVM was applied to multi-criteria inventory classification data since it is imbalanced in nature. The inventory classification outcomes of four benchmark techniques were used as class labels. The performance of MBSVM was compared with those of WBSVM algorithm as well as the traditional SVM technique.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) can play a crucial role in End-of-Life (EOL) product recovery. It can help in determining conditions of returned EOL products with the help of sensors and RFID tags, which then can be used to decide a feasible recovery process for the EOL product amongst disassembly, remanufacturing, recycling or disposal. Product design is a key criterion which affects the choice of recovery process. Complex product designs will increase the cost of disassembly which will lead to higher recovery costs. Therefore, considering the recovery operations during a product's design phase can lead to effective recovery process after its EOL. In order to see the effect of product design on product recovery using IoT, this paper proposes an Advanced-Remanufacturing-To-Order-Disassembly-To-Order (ARTODTO) system which receives sensors and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags embedded End-Of-Life (EOL) products to satisfy various products, components and materials demands. The received EOL products can be recovered via disassembly to meet the components demands, remanufactured to meet the products demands or recycled to meet the materials demands. The remaining EOL products can be disposed of. The model evaluates different designs of a product for the ease of disassembly and remanufacturing based on three criteria viz., total profit, quality level and the number of disposed items. To solve the proposed multi-criteria decision-making model, linear physical programming is used. An example of laptops is considered for illustration of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in medicine is the result of a large amount of effort expended in the interface of medicine and computer science. As some CAD systems in medicine try to emulate the diagnostic decision-making process of medical experts, they can be considered as expert systems in medicine. Furthermore, CAD systems in medicine may process clinical data that can be complex and/or massive in size. They do so in order to infer new knowledge from data and use that knowledge to improve their diagnostic performance over time. Therefore, such systems can also be viewed as intelligent systems because they use a feedback mechanism to improve their performance over time. The main aim of the literature survey described in this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of past and current CAD developments. This survey/review can be of significant value to researchers and professionals in medicine and computer science. There are already some reviews about specific aspects of CAD in medicine. However, this paper focuses on the entire spectrum of the capabilities of CAD systems in medicine. It also identifies the key developments that have led to today's state-of-the-art in this area. It presents an extensive and systematic literature review of CAD in medicine, based on 251 carefully selected publications. While medicine and computer science have advanced dramatically in recent years, each area has also become profoundly more complex. This paper advocates that in order to further develop and improve CAD, it is required to have well-coordinated work among researchers and professionals in these two constituent fields. Finally, this survey helps to highlight areas where there are opportunities to make significant new contributions. This may profoundly impact future research in medicine and in select areas of computer science.

AB  - One of the most important problems in the cities is atmospheric emission of anthropogenic origin. This problem is the key challenge mostly for city municipalities but also for business stakeholders, which are involved in freight transport at urban areas. One of the most important and efficient solutions to reduce this negative impact is implementation of electric vehicles. In recent years many activities and developments in this area have been done. This paper is focused on utilization of multi-criteria analysis for electric vehicles selection in the context of their usability for deliveries realization in cities. Moreover, it also presents general issues regarding the use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles, with emphasis on electric vehicles. It discusses the extent to which electric vehicles are used. It describes the key parameters for determining the usability of electric vehicles in urban deliveries. Based on the formulated assumptions, a multi-criteria model is proposed to enable selecting, out of the defined vehicles catalogue, solutions that are optimal in terms of potential effectiveness. The general aim of the paper is to support the logistics companies’ decision makers in the improvement of the freight vehicles fleets, taking into account the sustainable city logistics expectations.

AB  - Thermal energy storage (TES) using phase change materials (PCMs) is being widely considered as one of the alternative solutions for effective use of solar energy. This paper presents a multi-objective optimisation strategy for TES systems using PCMs for solar air systems, in which two performance indicators of average heat transfer effectiveness and effective PCM charging time were used as the conflicting objectives. The influence of the key design variables on the performance of an air-based PCM TES system was first experimentally investigated using Taguchi method, and the results were used to develop two performance models for optimisation. A genetic algorithm was used to search for an optimal Pareto front and a multi-criteria decision-making process was employed to determine the compromise optimal solutions. The results showed that the average heat transfer effectiveness of the PCM TES system can be improved from 44.25 to 59.29% while the effective PCM charging time increased from 4.53 to 6.11 h when using the solutions identified by the proposed strategy with the weighting factors of 0.5/0.5 for both objectives, in comparison to a baseline case. A further comparison showed that the optimal design identified by the proposed strategy outperformed the two designs identified using Taguchi method.

AB  - In recent years, energy management has become a necessary approach in organizations, since the existence of economic factors such as high energy costs, increased concern about emissions and scarce resources, and the emergence of government pressure for organizations to move toward more efficient and environmentally aware operations. In this way, it is necessary to build robust systems for managing resources and processes, ensuring the success of energy efficiency actions. The robustness of these systems has high dependence on the control and monitoring stages, which need to guarantee the provision of appropriate and reliable information, aiding in the decisions made by the managers of the organizations. Information and communication technologies, as well as their evolutions - Internet of things, are essential elements for the acquisition, treatment and management of the information related to the energy consumption of the organizations. Thus, they play an important role in the control and monitoring stages, once the correct choice of technologies directly impacts on the efficiency of the energy management system, showing that it is a step that demands manager’s attention. Based on this scenario, this work proposes, through the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method, a decision support process, helping in the choice of technologies that contribute to an efficient energy management system adapted to the needs of the organization. Thus, with the result of the work, the authors seek not only to clarify what criteria to consider, but also to propose a process of decision support concerning adequate technologies in energy management.

AB  - Energy Internet represents a critical breakthrough which is regarded as the synthetic product of information communication technologies and energy technologies. It is highly conducive to providing possible solutions for transforming energy management methods, reducing carbon emissions and achieving sustainable development. The extensive attention of scholars has been drawn to the progress of Energy Internet. However, the multi-objective optimisation and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for Energy Internet considering uncertainty still has some problems. (1) The actual number of optimisation objectives for Energy Internet design is more than two so that it is difficult to adopt conventional intelligence algorithms to solve it. (2) Most intelligence algorithms for double-objective optimisation model are not desirable. (3) The MCDM process of Energy Internet is not considered systematically. To solve these problems, an integrated approach combining improved great deluge algorithm (GDA), evidence reasoning (ER), interval algorithm, and fuzzy grey correlation analysis for multi-objective optimisation and MCDM of Energy Internet considering uncertainty is proposed in this paper. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach are illustrated by a visual case study of Energy Internet design.

AB  - Smart Manufacturing (SM) enables companies to perform processes more effectively and efficiently, ensuring faster demand fulfillment on the one hand, and a reduction of production costs on the other hand. Thus, SM can provide a competitive edge for manufacturers that successfully adopt it. In the process of adopting SM, building blocks play a critical role and can be seen as prerequisites. Managers of manufacturing companies are interested in learning what building blocks are relevant and can help make their operations smarter and more competitive. Our paper is a first attempt to answer this question through presenting the most frequently used building blocks for SM adoption. In order to achieve this objective, we conducted a systematic mapping review to identify both building blocks as well as current methods for adopting SM. In a next step, we matched the building blocks with the adoption methods. This matching of building blocks with the adoption methods helped in determining whether a building block actually recommended in the methods for adopting SM. We found that intelligent control, data analytics, IT-based production management systems (e.g., ERP, CAx, etc.), smart products/parts/materials, interoperability, data sharing systems and standards are the most commonly used building blocks for manufacturers that are aligned towards adopting SM. As a consequence, the future manufacturing workforce needs to be prepared to understand analytics, sensors, etc. The results also showed that, although building blocks such as blockchain, robots, visual technology, and 3D printing may find their application in specific manufacturing sectors, overall, they are less commonly associated with SM adoption compared to the other building blocks.

AB  - Hot-dip galvanizing is considered one of the most important corrosion protection alternatives for steel; however, its poor environmental performance has been a matter of concern. Even though many researchers have dealt with this topic in the past none of them have jointly dealt with the triple bottom line of sustainable development, and with the random and epistemic uncertainty of its measurement. For that reason, in this work, the sustainability of the hot-dip galvanizing process is investigated integrating: (a) 17 indicators taken from the 4 categories of the GREENSCOPE methodology and one quality performance indicator which is directly related to ISO 1461. (b) The additive utility method for multi-criteria decision-making. (c) The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process used to calculate the relative weights of both indicators and categories by means of a survey. (d) The hierarchical partitioning analysis used for determining the process stages that have a higher impact on sustainability variation, and others useful and suitable statistical tools for data analysis. Furthermore, the proposed framework is tested for a particular hot-dip galvanizing process, considering a random generation of each batch size, steel item characteristics and operating conditions via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. The results show that the stages of pickling and fluxing are critical for the analyzed system and they are not expected to be improved without a significant modification of the process. The proposal outlined in this paper might help designers, process engineers and researchers for a better decision-making process, focusing on the most critical stages while considering the trade-off between the three dimensions of sustainable development.

AB  - The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is usually employed to evaluate complex decisions, in which the assigned weights are specified artificially. In response, neural networks instead of manual selections can be used to optimize the assigned weights to avoid subjective errors. However, traditional neural networks usually suffer local extremums and cannot extract the deep features in the data. At the same time, variables that do not necessarily participate in the evaluation will also affect the results. In this context, a novel deep residual network based analytic hierarchy process which integrates principal component analysis algorithm (PIDRN-AHP) is suggested in this paper. Firstly, the operation variables most related to the target variables are extracted as the input data by principal component analysis (PCA) method. By fitting the residuals between input data and mapped output data with multiple continuous stacked non-linear computational layers, a deep residuals network is constructed with residual block local depth neural network structure units. Taking advantage of the deep network, the PIDRN-AHP can achieve optimal solutions of AHP global weights, avoid subjective errors and avoid possible gradient disappearance of deep networks due to the layer increase. The proposed method is applied to operational evaluations of Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). Compared with the traditional AHP, BP-AHP and DRN-AHP experiments show that the PIDRN-AHP can achieve the most satisfied performances.

AB  - The growing interest in sustainability increases the challenges for decision makers in selecting the sustainable suppliers in which consider economic, environmental and social aspects. Particularly, decision makers are being increasingly motivated to improve their supply chain activities in coping efficiently with the objectives of sustainable development. Where the era of sustainability threatens the current supply chain partners to either cope with the new regulations of sustainability or leave the field for new players. Notwithstanding, most of the recent studies considered economic and green criteria in handling sustainable supplier selection and order allocation (SSS/OA) problems overlooking the social criteria which represents the third pillar of sustainability. This work aims at putting forward a hybrid Multi Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)-Fuzzy Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) approach for a sustainable supplier selection and order allocation problem by considering economic, environmental and social criteria. Thus, an integrated Fuzzy AHP-Fuzzy TOPSIS is proposed to assess and rank suppliers according to three sets of criteria (i.e. conventional, green and social). A Multi-Objective Optimization Model (MOOM) is developed for choosing suppliers and allocating the optimal order quantities. To cope with the multiple uncertainties in the input data, the MOOM is reformulated into a Fuzzy Multi-Objective Optimization Model. The ε-constraint and LP-metrics approaches are used to reveal two sets of Pareto solutions based on the developed FMOOmodel. Finally, TOPSIS is applied to select the final Pareto solution that is closest to the ideal solution and furthest from the nadir solution. The effectiveness and the applicability of the developed hybrid MCDM-FMOO approach is demonstrated through a case study.

AB  - Diversity multi-criteria decision-making methods have been developed to address different complex decision-making problems, and the analytic network process has been found to be one of the most effective techniques. There is an increase in the quality and quantity of publications related to the analytic network process. This detailed overview can provide the research status and development characteristics of analytic network process research and will be useful to researchers for future research directions. To achieve these goals, bibliometric techniques were used. In addition, past and present hotspots of analytic network process research were concluded, and future research trends were determined. The bibliometric analysis was carried out from various aspects including countries and regions, institutions, journals, authors, research areas, articles and author keywords based on data harvested from the Web of Science database. There were 1485 analytic network process-related publications retrieved from the Web of Science. The results show that Expert Systems with Applications was the most productive journal publishing articles in analytic network process research (118); its number of publications has decreased dramatically since 2013, while Journal of Cleaner Production has shown an upward trend in recent years and ranks second with 47 publications. The most collaborative country is the United States. Taiwan takes a leading position in analytic network process research with 436 publications (29.36%), and National Chiao Tung University, which is located in Taiwan, produced the most articles and has gained the highest h-index (28). The major hot topics that employ analytic network process are sustainability, environmental management and supply chain management. These topics may continue to attract more attention in the future.

AB  - The process of steel casting involves several energy-intensive tasks such as heat transfer, solidification process, etc. Though the evolution of continuous casting of steel from the conventional ingot casting enabled a high amount of energy savings, operational parameter optimization considering various avenues of uncertainty is the key for next level of improvement in energy efficiency and process sustainability. To achieve this, a multi-objective optimization formulation under uncertainty has been proposed that can lead to simultaneous maximization of productivity and minimization of energy consumption. Among various uncertainty handling techniques, Chance Constrained Programming (CCP) is considered as an efficient approach. However, the requirement of uncertain parameters to follow some well-behaved probability distribution for having a closed form analytical solution in CCP is a bottleneck for most of the practical situations due to the unknown nature of uncertain data. This paper proposes a novel methodology called DDCCP (Data-Driven CCP), to amalgamate machine learning algorithms with CCP, thereby making the approach data-driven. A novel fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to transcript uncertain space such that the specific regions of uncertainty are identified accurately based on given uncertain data for more realistic sampling and thereby impacting the optimal solution accuracy. Implementing DDCCP on the casting model, ∼20–70% improvement in the objectives of energy calculations and 50–100% improvement in the metrics of Pareto optimal solutions are observed as compared to the existing box sampling approach showing efficacy of the proposed methodology.

Its preservation requires consideration, liability, know-how, know-why and experienced employee. Cultural heritage buildings’ performance is complicated work, therefore selecting a contractor for heritage buildings’ protection and restoration is a difficult assignment. The improper contractor's choice could activate cost overruns, lag, conflicts, declines, imperfect performance or added expenditure for project administration and accomplishment. This paper submits the quantitative and qualitative criteria setting for selecting heritage's contractor. The Analytic Hierarchy Process technique is applied to decide important criteria and to get the weighting for each criterion. The PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organisation Method for Enrichment Evaluation) technique is applied for the selection of the most efficient cultural heritage contractor's alternative.

As per the Global Agenda Council on Logistics and Supply Chains indicated that fruits and vegetables food losses due to improper handling and lack of proper cold transportation such as cold-logistics facilities/providers or inadequate infrastructure. In this article, a unique fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach is proposed for improving the food losses through cold-third party logistics providers (CTPLs) evaluation and selection process. Through a literature survey and expert opinion, five criteria and thirty sub-criteria were identified for reducing the food losses in fruits and vegetable supply chain. The proposed tool use of fuzzy-Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory tool for selection and evaluation the priority weights of the factors and fuzzy-analytical hierarchy process tool assessing the best CTPLs according to factors. The result shows that ‘Refrigerator and loading capacity’ and ‘Knowledge and Information technology management’ were most significant in the selection of CTPLs. The findings of this paper are anticipated to guide managers of the food industry, CTPLs, and government agencies in formulating of strategies for the practical food supply chain. Future scope includes extending the study for other developing countries, validating the proposed methodology, and improving the reliability of the model.

AB  - Abstract:
This paper presents the development and application of a bi-objective optimisation strategy to optimise the design of thermal energy storage (TES) systems using phase change materials (PCMs). The overall objective is to maximise the average heat transfer effectiveness of the PCM TES system, while minimising the effective PCM charging time. The proposed strategy featured with the utilisation of a fuzzy clustering algorithm and a weighted cumulative probability distribution (FC-WCPD) technique to identify optimal designs of the PCM TES systems. The fuzzy clustering algorithm was first time introduced in a bi-objective optimisation algorithm and was used to evaluate and select the potential optimal solutions in each generation by taking into account the trade-off between the two conflicting optimisation objectives. The weighted cumulative probability distribution technique was used to transfer the optimal characteristics through iterations and facilitate the convergence of the optimisation process. The optimal design identified for the case studied was the inlet air temperature of 42 °C, the air flow rate of 74.91 l/s, the number of the PCM bricks in the air flow direction of 5, and the number of air channels of 4 when the weight factors were 0.5 for both optimisation objectives. By using this optimal design, the average heat transfer effectiveness of the PCM TES system and the effective PCM charging time were 61.87% and 6.61 h, respectively. Further comparison showed that the optimal design was consistent with the optimal solutions identified using a controlled elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) and a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process.

AB  - The genetic algorithm as a successful procedure that has been widely used in previous works to optimally design a product family. In this paper, to improve optimization procedure, a novel modification on the augmented chromosomes after performing genetic operations is proposed. Some drawbacks of product family penalty function (PFPF), such as the inability to detect the level of platform commonality, are illustrated and fully discussed by counterexamples. To overcome this drawback, a commonality index based on the augmented chromosome is employed as a further modification to select trade-off optimum design points using multi-criteria decision-making methods. The proposed modifications are employed to optimally design a family of S-rails for an automotive platform. The S-rails are the main components in front and rear of the automotive underbody with significant effects on crashworthiness capability of a vehicle. Therefore, to find S-rails with high commonality and crashworthiness capability, experimentally verified S-rail models are implemented through a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with four-objective optimization, namely remaining energy, peak crushing force, mass, and PFPF. Results show that there exists a set of S-rails with acceptable crashworthiness capability and 100% commonality, which can be used in all products within the product family.

AB  - This research suggests an approach constructed on the connotation of plithogenic theory and VIKOR (VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) technique to come up with a methodical procedure to assess the infirmary serving under a framework of plithogenic theory, where the ambiguity, incomplete information, qualitative information, approximate evaluation, imprecision and uncertainty are addressed with semantic expressions determined by plithogenic numbers and computing of contradiction degrees of attribute values. This research stratifies the plithogenic multi criteria decision making (MCDM) strategy for defining the significant weights of assessing standards, and the VIKOR technique is applied for enhancing the serving efficiency classifications of the possible substitutes. An experimental issue, including 11 assessing standards, 3 private and 2 general hospitals in Zagazig, has been evaluated by 3 assessors from several areas of medical activities, asked to validate the suggested strategy. In this research, we give some definitions of the plithogenic environment, which is more general and comprehensive than fuzzy, intuitionistic fuzzy and neutrosophic ones. The plithogeny is interested in the contradiction degrees between attribute values that help in better calculating the aggregations. We conducted the data analysis and the results showed us that the serving efficiency of private medical centers is superior than that of general medical centers due to the fact that public medical centers are scarcely supported by governmental institutions. The private medical centers have to ward themselves to keep possession of bringing patients or attract patients. We conducted the sensitivity analysis of the achieved results, to verify their validity, and to find out to what extent the different values affect the ranking of available alternatives.

AB  - Himalayan high-altitude wetlands (HAWs) are some of the most iconic and hydrologically dynamic ecosystems in South and Central Asia. Yet little is known about their historical ecology; less is reported on their management. To address these gaps, this article leverages predictive modelling and multi-criteria decision analysis to evaluate HAWs for biological conservation. Specifically, it builds upon prior efforts to recognize HAW “complexes” as Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance. Results indicate that HAWs occupy 69 430 ha in the Sikkim Eastern Himalayas, with marginal, fringe, or seasonal extents expanding outward to 170 700 ha. Over 800 species are documented from these sites, including migratory birds of relevance to the Ramsar Convention. For example, species like the Black-necked Crane, Ruddy Shelduck, and Eurasian Widgeon depend on HAWs for breeding and layover. Although a third of identified HAWs occur within protected areas, those of highest conservation priority are located outside of these zones along India's trans-Himalayan frontier. Existing laws and state notifications largely support wetland conservation. However, both the Ramsar Secretariat and Government of India should further clarify legal terminology, such as the principal of “wise use”, to ensure that parties meet Convention obligations. Future efforts are needed to systematically survey HAW biodiversity and monitor their responses to global change.

AB  - The decision to install a particular type of green roof (GR) should be made during the design stage of a project due to the different costs and benefits each GR type offers. Although much research has been conducted into the various types of GR, there is a gap in our understanding of the process of decision-making during the selection of a GR type. This paper aims to develop a decision support system (DSS) for selecting the optimum type of GR for residential buildings in Kuala Lumpur. The decision criteria were initially determined using fuzzy Delphi method, followed by the creation of a database based on expert opinions, where the experts met certain criteria regarding their expertise in this field. For data analysis, a cybernetic fuzzy analytic network process was employed as a hybrid method that ignores the least important criteria in selecting the optimum type of GR for a building. Three examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of this prototype DSS in detail. Finally, it was concluded that the prototype DSS automates the entire process of GR type selection. Moreover, it enables decision-makers to select the most suitable alternative considering all significant financial and non-financial decision criteria.

AB  - Process planning is a decision-making procedure to determine the required manufacturing processes and machine tools, and the sequence of the activities that the processes should follow, to produce a designed part or a product component. The quality of the process plan has a major impact on the efficiency and productivity of the whole production process in addition to the quality of the final product. Computer-aided process planning (CAPP) systems have been constantly developing and attracted considerable research efforts during the last four decades. Several approaches such as search logic structure, variant or case-based, generative approach, hybrid, and knowledge-based or expert systems have been employed to develop the CAPP systems with the aim of reducing and finally removing the role of experienced process planners in providing a reliable and optimized process plan to achieve the automated and intelligent CAPP system. However, despite these huge efforts, the process planning task is not completely automated yet and still depends on human experiences and knowledge. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics seem to be promising tools to achieve the total independence of CAPP systems on the experience of the process planners in the era of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing systems. The ideal intelligent CAPP systems will be able to collect the experience and knowledge of the technology experts in addition to being adaptive and self-learning according to the machining process real-time data and work history. In this article, a literature review is carried out with the aim of gaining a comprehensive insight into the state-of-the-art intelligent process planning approaches. Several articles and books based on the types and the applications of the systems are reviewed with a focus on the publishing date within the last decade. The advantages and disadvantages of different approaches are presented and finally, the future research and investigation pathways are demonstrated.

AB  - Predicting future stock index price movement has always been a fascinating research area both for the investors who wish to yield a profit by trading stocks and for the researchers who attempt to expose the buried information from the complex stock market time series data. This prediction problem can be addressed as a binary classification problem with two class labels, one for the increasing movement and other for the decreasing movement. In literature, a wide range of classifiers has been tested for this application. As the performance of individual classifier varies for a diverse dataset with respect to different performance measures, it is impractical to acknowledge a specific classifier to be the best one. Hence, designing an efficient classifier ensemble instead of an individual classifier is fetching increasing attention from many researchers. Again selection of base classifiers and deciding their preferences in ensemble with respect to a variety of performance criteria can be considered as a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. In this paper, an integrated TOPSIS Crow Search based weighted voting classifier ensemble is proposed for stock index price movement prediction. Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), one of the popular MCDM techniques, is suggested for ranking and selecting a set of base classifiers for the ensemble whereas the weights of the classifiers used in the ensemble are tuned by the Crow Search method. The proposed ensemble model is validated for prediction of stock index price over the historical prices of BSE SENSEX, S&P500 and NIFTY 50 stock indices. The model has shown better performance compared to individual classifiers and other ensemble models such as majority voting, weighted voting, differential evolution and particle swarm optimization based classifier ensemble.

AB  - This research presents a decision support methodology for the multi-criteria supplier selection and order allocation problem. The proposed approach supports purchasing managers in assembling mid-term supplier portfolios while making them aware of the trade-offs between the supplier sustainability, the purchasing costs, and the overall supply risk. First, we propose a multi-objective optimization model with three objectives: to maximize the supplier sustainability, to select the supplier portfolio with the lowest purchasing costs, and to minimize the supply risk. Our model extends existing mathematical approaches that follow the portfolio theory fathered by H. Markowitz by integrating the aspect ‘risk’ into the supplier selection problem. Secondly, since we allow for integer variables in our model—in contrast to the classical Markowitz portfolio theory—we use the ε-constraint method to visualize the efficient surface. The possibility of considering the non-dominated set of supplier portfolios is advantageous for purchasing managers as they gain a picture of the different optimal supplier portfolios and are able to analyze the trade-offs between the different purchasing goals before making a decision. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology in a real-world supplier selection and order allocation case from the automotive industry. In the example case, we identify 1754 optimal supplier portfolios that may be assembled based on the eight available suppliers. Our analyses show that each optimal portfolio consists of two suppliers, with one specific supplier being included in each portfolio. Furthermore, four suppliers are not part of any optimal solution.

AB  - Optimization is the process of finding an alternative with the most profitable or highest performance possible within the specified limits, maximizing the desired factors and minimizing the unwanted ones. In this project, the multi-objective optimization, ie the simultaneous optimization of several factors, is performed on the parameters in the drilling operation using the multi-objective function Taguchi and TOPSIS. The material used for the milling operation is the glass fiber reinforced polymer and the parameters are the surface roughness, the rate of material removal and the delamination factor. TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-making method developed by Yoon and Wang, which involves determining the shortest distance from the positive solution and the greater distance. of the negative solution. For the maximized parameters, the maximum weighted value is the positive solution, while for the minimized parameters, the minimum weighted value is the positive solution. Dr. Taguchi of Nippon Telephones and Telegraph Company, in Japan, developed an experiment-based method called “ORTHOGONAL ARRAY” which provides a very small “variance” for the experiment with “optimal settings” of the control parameters.

In this project there is a performance of different factors of simultaneous optimization as the parameters in milling operation by combining the method of GRA and DFA. The simultaneous optimization is also known as multi-objective optimization. The epoxy glass fibre is the material used for milling operation and the parameters are delamination factor, machining force and surface roughness. On which every parameters have to be in minimized magnitude. The Grey relational analysis (GRA) is based on the grey system theory. GRA is used to study the relation among various attributes in a system and for solving the complicated interrelationships among the multiple responses. DFA is one of the most used methods in the industry for optimizing multiple response features. The analysis of the desirability function is used to convert multiple response characteristics into unique response characteristics.

AB  - Time and cost estimations of project activities are challenging tasks for project managers and planners. As a result of the high level of risk and uncertainty present during the early stages of projects, the reliability of these estimations during project planning remains poor. This study argues that this reliability can be improved through using the ‘concept of stratification’. This concept considers a set of states and describes a system that receives inputs (associated with outputs), based on which the system transitions from one state to another. This provides a unique structure that is capable of considering uncertainty related to events that may occur during a project. This paper explains how the concept of stratification can be used to compute estimations of the time and cost of activities involved in a project. The method is illustrated with a construction project that has uncertain events. By determining specific activities’ estimated time and cost, the project's estimated time and cost can also be calculated. Thus, the proposed method increases the reliability of estimations of projects’ completion time and cost.

AB  - Regional disaster risk assessment is of practical value for disaster prevention and mitigation in emergency management. It remains an ongoing challenge due to the multiple criteria associated with the decision making problem. In this paper we propose a new multi-criteria decision making method to evaluate the natural disaster risk of China at the region scale. The evaluation index system is composed of 28 indicators reflecting the danger of natural disasters and the vulnerability of the affected body. The method involves a combination of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Self-Organizing Map (SOM), Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap), and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to achieve the clustering, visualization, and ranking of Chinese regions. Compared with the traditional ranking methods in regional disaster risk assessment, the proposed method is able to recognize the similarity of regions, exploit the embedded clustering structures, visualize the high dimensional regional data, examine the influence of indicators, and rank the regions in terms of the disaster risk. It offers a comprehensive and visual way for policy makers or related organizations to understand the studied data from different perspectives and thus mitigate the disaster risk in the Chinese regions.

AB  - This paper proposes a methodology to select an expert for the development of humanitarian and social projects based on multi-criteria decision-making with incomplete information relations to add more objectivity to the recruitment process. The proposed approach starts with assessing the decision makers (DMs) by means of Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Then, Analytic Network Process (ANP) is used to weigh the criteria in order to take into account the interdependencies between criteria. In the recruiting process, an expert could be unable to assess all criteria. Therefore, the incomplete preference relations is used when a DM is unable to express his judgment. At a later stage, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is addressed to rank the different candidates. The proposed methodology is applied to a situation where an extra DM evaluates four DMs, and six criteria are used to select one candidate among five. The obtained criteria weights and the final ranking of the candidates are analysed and compared to an approach where there is no lack of information in the decision maker’s preferences.

AB  - Net-zero energy buildings are playing a critical role in the decarbonization of future cities since the buildings are responsible for 30–40% of total energy consumption. A residential net-zero energy building with a prospect of commercialization was introduced, which adopts solar energy systems and heat insulation solar glass that simultaneously generates electric power and minimizes heat loss. Dynamic and parametric simulation models were developed based on the TRNSYS platform and were validated by experimental data or standard test reports. A multi-criteria decision-making framework based on the energetic and economic criteria was developed to evaluate system performance and to find the favorable layout of the energy system in the residential net-zero energy building. Twelve system scenarios, covering the individual heat insulation solar glass system, the hybrid systems integrated with solar PV, solar thermal and heat insulation solar glass, and the hybrid systems combined solar thermal and heat insulation solar glass, were comparatively assessed. Among the system scenarios inclusive of solar thermal technology, a combination of the compound parabolic concentrated solar collector and variable-effect absorption chiller is highly recommended. However, the system scenario, which consists of a specific PV area of 8.4 m2/kW and employs heat insulation solar glass, is most favorable due to a highest primary energy saving ratio of 1.05 and a lowest levelized total cost of 5920 US$/year. All system scenarios proposed herein are not economically feasible at the current economic parameters in Singapore’s climate. However, the optimized hybrid system (integrated with solar PV, solar thermal and heat insulation solar glass) is sufficient to reach the net-zero energy target while the optimized solar PV system combined heat insulation solar glass is a solution of the positive energy building.

AB  - We study a strategic-level ammunution distribution network design problem (ADNDP) where the purpose is to determine the locations and the service assignments of main, regional, and local depots in order to meet the ammunition needs of military units considering several factors, e.g., stock levels at the depots, costs, and risk levels of depot locations. ADNDP is a real-world and large-scale problem for which scientific decision making methods do not exist. We propose a methodology that uses multi-objective mathematical modeling, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and Geographic Information System (GIS) to solve the problem. The multi-objective mathematical model determines the locations and the service assignments of depots considering two objectives, namely, to minimize transportation costs and to minimize risk scores of main depot locations. The risk score of a depot location indicates how vulnerable the location is to disruptions and is determined by a combined AHP-TOPSIS analysis where TOPSIS is used to compute the risk scores and AHP is used to compute the weights needed by TOPSIS for the identified risk attributes. The GIS analysis is conducted to determine the potential depot locations using map layers based on spatial criteria. We have applied the proposed methodology in designing and evaluating a real ammunition distribution network under different scenarios in collaboration and cooperation with the area experts. We have employed the weighted-sum method to find non-dominated solutions for each scenario and discussed their tradeoffs with the area experts. The purpose of this paper is to present the proposed methodology, findings, and insights.

AB  - Transverse Flux Permanent Magnet Motor (TFPMM) has received extensive attention in the field of electric vehicles. The magnetic circuit of TFPMM is three-dimensional and non-linear, which leads to the high nonlinearity of electromagnetic torque. Although the three-dimensional finite element method (3DFEM) could be used to estimate torque, it is very time-consuming. Instead of it, this study adopts a kind of machine learning method—Gaussian process regression (GPR). For the hyper-parameters optimization of GPR, most previous studies used single-objective algorithms for improving the regression accuracy. However, GPR is an algorithm of probability prediction and it could not guarantee to have the satisfactory confidence interval characteristic simultaneously while the regression precision achieves optimal. Therefore this paper proposes a variable parameters fuzzy dominance genetic algorithm (VPFDGA) which is suitable for the multi-objective optimization, including the optimization of regression precision, confidence interval reliability, confidence interval width and skill score. By combining GPR with VPFDGA, the electromagnetic torque of a building-block transverse flux permanent magnet motor (B-TFPMM) is estimated by VPFDGA-GPR (GPR based on variable parameters fuzzy dominance genetic algorithm). Besides, two other GPRs based multi-objective optimization, three GPRs based on single-objective optimization and a GPR based on weighted sum method that is the classic multi-objective optimization algorithm are all implemented to compare with VPFDGA-GPR. The results of comparison show that VPFDGA-GPR has the better performances including the higher regression precision, more powerful ability of probability prediction, higher stability, less convergence time and so on.

AB  - Agricultural land suitability analysis (ALSA) for crop production is one of the key tools for ensuring sustainable agriculture and for attaining the current global food security goal in line with the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) of United Nations. Although some review studies addressed land suitability, few of them specifically focused on land suitability analysis for agriculture. Furthermore, previous reviews have not reflected on the impact of climate change on future land suitability and how this can be addressed or integrated into ALSA methods. In the context of global environmental changes and sustainable agriculture debate, we showed from the current review that ALSA is a worldwide land use planning approach. We reported from the reviewed articles 69 frequently used factors in ALSA. These factors were further categorized in climatic conditions (16), nutrients and favorable soils (34 of soil and landscape), water availability in the root zone (8 for hydrology and irrigation) and socio-economic and technical requirements (11). Also, in getting a complete view of crop’s ecosystems and factors that can explain and improve yield, inherent local socio-economic factors should be considered. We showed that this aspect has been often omitted in most of the ALSA modeling with only 38% of the total reviewed article using socio-economic factors. Also, only 30% of the studies included uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in their modeling process. We found limited inclusions of climate change in the application of the ALSA. We emphasize that incorporating current and future climate change projections in ALSA is the way forward for sustainable or optimum agriculture and food security. To this end, qualitative and quantitative approaches must be integrated into a unique ALSA system (Hybrid Land Evaluation System - HLES) to improve the land evaluation approach.

AB  - It is now well established that solar energy is a reliable alternative way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to mitigate climate change effects. In Morocco, solar energy investments are rapidly rising since 2009 and are expected to grow dramatically in the next decade. Site selection is a critical issue when large-scale solar plants are being planned. In this paper, the multi-criteria evaluation method is used to identify suitable sites to host Photovoltaic projects in southern Morocco. For this purpose, geographical information systems and analytic hierarchy process methods were combined to represent a high-resolution map that compares the potential of the studied region to host large-scale Photovoltaic projects. HOMER software was then used for modeling and simulating a 10 MW grid-connected PV system. The optimum scheme is analyzed to assess the economic feasibility in the most suitable site in the Souss-Massa region. The findings from this study confirm that 24.08% of the studied area offers suitable sites to host the Photovoltaic farms. The HOMER simulation has clearly shown that the grid-connected Photovoltaic system is beneficial in the long run, although its initial capital is higher than the grid supply only. Also, the cost of electricity generated from Photovoltaic panels is affordable.

AB  - The authors propose a universal methodology for measuring and assessing the synergy potential when combining companies into a group, using the business model perspective. Based on interviews with company representatives, as well as consultations with Polish software industry experts, we have found 40 key variables which are characteristic for business models of resellers and integrators. The combination of business model concepts, of Balanced Scorecard and multi-criteria decision analysis, as proposed in the paper, allows the opportunities and threats (for strategic objectives to be reached within company group) in terms of business model variables, to be indicated more precisely. The results of the multi-criteria analysis of the decision making process show the reseller - integrator combination to create a high potential for market synergies and an average potential for improving operational processes. Present methodology generates the transparent information on how a business model works and how it stimulates the combination of companies. In particular, we provide the picture of synergy potential of the company group.

AB  - Industrial symbiosis (IS) can generate economic, social, and environmental benefits, and support sustainable development; thus, many governments and scholars are devoted to exploring it. To analyze and evaluate the current status and development trends of industrial symbiosis, this study selects “industrial symbiosis” as a research title to search the Web of Science (core collection) database, and uses the bibliometrics and social network analysis (SNA) methods. The results turn out that an increasing amount of research has been devoted to industrial symbiosis in recent years. They also show that the study of industrial symbiosis has obvious cross-disciplinary characteristics. Current research on industrial symbiosis mainly focuses on four issues: evolution and development, operation carriers, driving mechanisms, and efficiency evaluation of industrial systems. The research of the industrial symbiosis network will greatly promote the industrial green development for the industrial transformation and upgrading of various countries. Many methods are used to examine these four questions, including case studies, life cycle assessment (LCA), material flow analysis (MFA), data envelopment analysis (DEA), multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), emergy analysis, and SNA. This article provides the trends of industrial symbiosis research for further study. The data mining can be used in the industrial symbiosis network and a dynamic simulation industry symbiotic evolutionary process model can be discussed in the future.

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) is estimated to play a significant role in offering tangible and commercial benefits to the supply chains making the operational processes more efficient and productive. IoT system provides the decision-makers with new insights on the value proposition, value creation, helping them to strengthen their bond with the customers and adopt a more effective policy and practices. The food retailing scenario is becoming more complex and flexible putting pressure on the retailing firms to re-design their marketing strategies incorporating the changing consumer behavior. The IoT is expected to help the retailers in controlling the quality of food products, plan waste management of the items that have exceeded their shelf life, manage the temperature at the store, freezers and other equipment’s contributing to the reduction of energy consumption. Despite the vast potential of IoT in food retail supply chains, the adoption of IoT is still in its nascent stage. Therefore, this study attempts to identify the various barriers that affect the adoption of IoT in the retail supply chain in the Indian context and also investigates the inter-dependences between the factors using a two-stage integrated ISM and DEMATEL methodology. Lack of government regulations and poor internet infrastructure were identified to be the significant drivers for IoT adoption.

KW  - Multi-criteria decision aids
AB  - While Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) has provided many methods and tools for solving design problems, food processes have benefitted little from them. MOO encompasses the identification of performance indicators, process modelling, preference integration, trade-off assessment, and finding the best trade-offs. In this review, the use of these five elements in the design of food processes through MOO is analysed. A number of studies dealing with food processes MOO have been identified. Even though these studies improve the design process, they often approach MOO in a simplified and insufficiently rationalized way. Based on this review, several research issues are identified, related to the improvement of the different models and methods, and to the development of more holistic MOO methods for food processes.
Background
The challenge of food process engineering, taking into account the many constraints, is becoming increasingly difficult. Multi-objective Optimization (MOO) has provided many methods and tools to solve design problems, which often entail conflicting objectives (e.g. product quality vs. profit). Thus, only a trade-off can result from the design process, where preferences and weighting of the conflicting objectives has to be included.
Scope and approach
In this review, MOO methods used in food process design studies are analysed through the framework of the five elements which constitute a MOO method: i) performance indicators to quantify the design objectives; ii) a predictive process model to evaluate the different design solutions; iii) decision-maker and/or expert preferences, expressed as weights of the different objectives and satisfaction levels on indicator values; iv) a selection method to select one or several “best” trade-offs; v) an optimization algorithm to find the best design solutions among the feasible ones. Key findings and conclusions: The authors highlight the fact that more holistic MOO methods can be used to improve the design process, as numerous methods have been developed to build MOO methods, particularly in the field of Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM). The literature reveals that MOO is often approached in a simplified and insufficiently rationalized way, which hinders the use of MCDM methods to improve the design process. Several research issues are also identified, related to the improvement of the different models and methods, which could help develop more holistic MOO methods for food processes.

AB  - Detection of fraudulent transactions is a vital factor for financial institutions, and finding more effective and accurate methods is of tremendous importance. The use of supervised data mining techniques is not feasible in many cases due to the lack of access to labeled data. Fraud detection is a complex task, and unsupervised methods like clustering and outlier detection techniques employed alone do not yield satisfactory results. Another issue is epistemic uncertainty due to the absence of sufficient information on the behavioral aspects of different customers, which also leads to poorer results for fraud detection and makes the fraud detection system inapplicable in real world environment. In this paper, using multi criteria decision method, intuitionistic fuzzy set, and evidential reasoning, a new method for detection of fraud was introduced, which infuses several behavioral evidence of a transaction concerning the effect of uncertainty for them. Transactional behavior was modeled by considering the trends of different main and aggregated variables at different periods and the extent of deviation of the new arrived transaction from each of these trends were considered as behavioral evidence. The final belief, which is the result of the combination of much evidence using the proposed method, will determine the originality of a newly arrived transaction. Finally, using a real world dataset, the results of the new method were compared with the results of Dempster–Shafer method in terms of the number of frauds discovered and the number of erroneous alerts they issued. The findings showed that the method introduced in this study has higher accuracy and lower false alarms compared to Dempster–Shafer method while the computational complexity of this method makes its implementation time longer.

AB  - This paper contributes to the discourse on how to determine tourist satisfaction. The aim therefore is to analyze to what extent international tourists visiting South Africa are satisfied by using fuzzy numbers. The measurement of satisfaction with tourist destinations (DSAT) is based on a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (F-MCDM) model that evaluates DSAT according to a number of different segments based on gender, age, and mother tongue. We find empirical evidence for DSAT differences between the segments considered in the analysis. Results show that females are more satisfied than males; tourists between 56 and 65 years old are the most satisfied, while millennials younger than 35 are the least satisfied; English mother-tongue speakers are more satisfied than other tourists. Our findings have clear implications for DMOs' managers regarding the design of marketing campaigns for South African destinations, especially for those segments analyzed in the study. Proposals for future research will also be outlined.

AB  - The Impact Assessment (IA) step in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies is classified into three steps of characterization, normalization and weighting. In this research, various impact categories were weighted using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), as a multi criteria decision making tool. Iranian tobacco production system was the example of agricultural system. The data for LCA analysis were collected from 225 farms. The data for AHP analysis were gathered by surveying 12 LCA experts. The results indicated that on-farm emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, NH3, NOx and SO2 were accounted for 25, 96, 93, 99, 21 and 2% of the total emissions (cradle to farm gate), respectively. The characterization indices for the impact categories of acidification, terrestrial eutrophication, global warming, phosphate resources depletion, potash resources depletion and fossil resources depletion for one ton tobacco production were calculated to be 13.87 kgSO2eq, 19.69 kgNOxeq, 1883.90 kgCO2eq, 19.69 kgNOxeq, 4.19 kgP2O5, 6.14 kgK2O, and 59,659.23 MJ, respectively. The LCA + AHP showed that the weighted factors of global warming, terrestrial eutrophication, acidification, fossil resources depletion, phosphate resources depletion and potash resources depletion were 1, 0.790, 0.518, 0.681, 0.422, and 0.263, respectively. Many agricultural systems could benefit from using the developed weighting factors for LCA studies in the agricultural sector. Based on the new developed weighted factors, the weighted indices of aforementioned impact categories for Iranian tobacco production were 0.24, 0.41, 0.19, 1.04, 0.23, and 0.20, respectively. This implies that fossil resources depletion impact category was attributed the highest negative environmental impacts of tobacco production followed by terrestrial eutrophication.

There are many factors influencing the development of medical tourism in developing countries. This research aims to identify those factors for medical tourism development in Malaysia. We investigate the factors from the literature to develop a new decision-making model. We use two multi-criteria decision making techniques, Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Fuzzy Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS), to reveal the interrelationships among the factors and to find the relative importance of these factors in the decision making model. The results showed that human and technological factors are the most important factors for medical tourism adoption in Malaysia. The results of this study will enable key players in the medical tourism industry to potentially assign investments for medical tourism in the developing countries.

Past malware studies tend to investigate the novel approaches of preventing, detecting and responding to malware threats but little attention has been given to the area of risk assessment. This paper aims to fill that gap by presenting a risk assessment approach that evaluate the risk zone for an application. The permission-based approach is presented for evaluating and zoning the Android applications (EZADroid), based on risk assessment. The EZADroid applies the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a decision factor to calculate the risk value. A total of 5000 benign and 5000 malware applications were drawn from the AndroZoo and Drebin datasets for evaluation. Results showed that the EZADroid had achieved 89.82% accuracy rate in classifying the application into a different level of risk zones (i.e. very low, low, medium, and high).

AB  - Developments in the internet of things technology (IoT) have greatly influenced the way we live and have been seen in a variety of application areas, including health care. Most of the papers reviewed dealt with some health care services, and there is little scientific literature on the application or implementation of IoT in cancer detection and treatment services. This encouraged us to (re) evaluate the provision of health-care services and their location to harness the benefits associated with the use of IoT. Also, the lateness which caused by transmitting data to the cloud and back to the application is inadmissible for healthcare systems which based on IoT. As well, it is not efficient to transmit so much data to the cloud for processing and storage, because it would saturate network bandwidth and not be scalable. This also encouraged us to use fog computing which take advantages of cloud resources and coordinate the utilization of geographically distributed edge devices. So, this paper proposes the implementation of healthcare system which based on IoT and fog computing technologies for averting the spread of cancer via early detection, evaluation of disease’s symptoms, and also analyzing health data that gathered from IoT through various sensor networks and other smart devices to help healthcare professionals to turn a stream of data into actionable insights and evidence-based healthcare decision-making to improve and enhance cancer treatment. Due to the similarity of the general symptoms of cancer with some other diseases , we also proposed a neutrosophic multi-criteria decision making technique for assisting healthcare professionals to predict disease that patient may be suffers from if he/she does not have cancer. This technique depends on gathered data from proposed healthcare system and able to handle uncertainty of imprecision and ambiguity which resulted from the proportional priority scales of different symptoms of disease.

AB  - The increasing impact of flooding urges more effective flood management strategies to guarantee sustainable ecosystem development. Recent catastrophes underline the importance of avoiding local flood management, but characterizing large scale basin wide approaches for systemic flood risk management. Here we introduce an information-theoretic Portfolio Decision Model (iPDM) for the optimization of a systemic ecosystem value at the basin scale by evaluating all potential flood risk mitigation plans. iPDM calculates the ecosystem value predicted by all feasible combinations of flood control structures (FCS) considering environmental, social and economical asset criteria. A multi-criteria decision analytical model evaluates the benefits of all FCS portfolios at the basin scale weighted by stakeholder preferences for assets’ criteria as ecosystem services. The risk model is based on a maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) that predicts the flood susceptibility, the risk of floods based on the exceedance probability distribution, and its most important drivers. Information theoretic global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is used to select the simplest and most accurate model based on a flood return period. A stochastic optimization algorithm optimizes the ecosystem value constrained to the budget available and provides Pareto frontiers of optimal FCS plans for any budget level. Pareto optimal solutions maximize FCS diversity and minimize the criticality of floods manifested by the scaling exponent of the Pareto distribution of flood size that links management and hydrogeomorphological patterns. The proposed model is tested on the 17,000 km2 Tiber river basin in Italy. iPDM allows stakeholders to identify optimal FCS plans in river basins for a comprehensive evaluation of flood effects under future ecosystem trajectories.

To that end, Data Envelopment Analysis and Multi-Criteria-Decision-Making techniques are used with raw indicators from the 2017 edition of the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum (WEF). An outstanding feature of our approach is that weights are endogenously generated. Furthermore, the role played by several variables in tourism competitiveness is assessed using truncated regression and bootstrapping. The ranking of world tourist destinations produced by our weighted composite indicator of competitiveness is, however, fairly similar to that derived from the unweighted indicator provided by the WEF. Furthermore, we also find that several economic, geographical, cultural and political features are significant determinants of the competitiveness of tourist destinations.

Screening of EOR methods is a multi-criteria decision making process, and the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method as a systematic statistical method, can be applied in this regard. In this paper, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) as one of the methods under the MCDM category was used to screen 65 Iranian oil reservoirs. The screening method was employed for 10 different EOR techniques using a wide range of properties and conditions. The analysis used a database including more than 800 successful EOR projects across the world and for 9 ideal reservoir parameter values. The relative importance of the reservoir parameters was determined based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) at nine importance levels. The findings showed that among the considered screening parameters, to determine the best EOR technique, lithology of the reservoir is the most influencing parameter. Additionally, almost 74% of the oil reservoirs under study, as a first priority, were eligible for CO2 injection, either miscible or immiscible. Thermal methods were in the second stage of ranking. The first and second candidate choice for onshore oil reservoirs was immiscible CO2 and hydrocarbon gas injection, respectively. For offshore reservoirs, CO2 injection and steam flooding were the best choices. Also, miscible N2 injection was the least important technique, due to the huge difference of considered reservoir pressure with minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) of N2 injection. The proposed technique is computationally fast and less expensive than field simulation studies for ranking EOR projects for any oil reservoir in the world.

AB  - In this study, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework is established to optimize the renewable energy project (REP) portfolio(s) in an efficient way. Firstly, from the perspective of sustainability, three objectives of economic, social and environmental impacts as well as 16 subordinated criteria are identified for REP performance evaluation via literature review. Secondly, the performance of REPs on these criteria is adopted the form of interval type-2 fuzzy (IT2F) numbers to fully describe the inherent uncertainties in the REP portfolio optimization problem. Thirdly, the fuzzy weights of these criteria are obtained using interval type-2 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (IT2F-AHP) technique. Fourthly, based on the criteria performances and criteria weights, the interval type-2 fuzzy weighted averaging (IT2FWA) operator is used to aggregate the fuzzy values of REPs in term of the three objectives. Fifthly, a zero-one programming model is formulated and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II is employed to capture an optimal-Pareto set by considering the trade-off between the three objectives. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a case study in Southeast China is conducted. Results show that the criteria greenhouse gas emission reduction owns the highest weight, and three non-dominant solutions with uniform distribution are obtained.

AB  - Context
In recent years, various complex and similar-function cloud services with different quality of service features are offered in services pool. Such diversity of services complicates the efficient selection of atomic services and the automatic provision of composited ones.
Objective
We aim to shed light on the significance of agent-based decision-making methods for boosting cloud services' composition and modelling such complex systems using petri net (PN) techniques.
Method
In this paper, we report a survey of relevant and related literature focusing on agent-based petri net decision-making modelling for cloud service composition (CSC). We analyse the surveyed works and explain their strengths and weaknesses.
Results
We found how these technologies and techniques can be well-suited for CSC requirements in overcoming the most important documented challenges. Aside from agent technologies for boosting CSC, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods are suitable for ensuring service selection for composition operatively because they match end-user requirements with the trade-off criteria that cloud services are characterised with and are well-suited for the agent-based architecture. Furthermore, PNs are appropriate for supporting the modelling of such systems as groups of independent and loosely coupled modules.
Conclusion
We suggest using a couple of agent-based problem-solving techniques to efficiently composite singular services automatically. This utilisation must be supported with an integrated and hybrid MCDM methodology to facilitate the ranking and selection of compromise solutions. The proposed solutions will be impressive if the whole process is systematically and mathematically formulated by PNs. This survey can be used by researchers aiming to join this line of research for further achievement.

AB  - Agricultural supply chain management includes all the events involved in moving products of the agricultural sector from the field to the customer, and is a crucial aspect ensuring the rich contribution of the agricultural sector to the economic growth of the nation. The purpose of this paper is to add value to the present knowledge base by ascertaining the challenges of the agricultural supply chain in India on the basis of a thorough literature survey and the Delphi technique. Following this, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory approach was used to model the identified challenges, explore the cause–effect interrelationship, and to develop the systematic hierarchical structures of challenges through an interpretive structural modeling methodology. The implementation of the approach in the Indian context led to the inference that two factors, namely limited integration among the national agricultural markets, and limited agricultural market infrastructure were the most important ones. The integrated model obtained as an output of this study intends to guide the agricultural policy- and decision-makers to improve the performance of the agricultural supply chain in India. Also, some essential recommendations have been given to improve the efficiency of the agricultural supply chain management.

Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has provided this support by estimating the novel feature of managerial efficiency, which has frequently been used in recent two-stage DPMs. As key contributions, this study extends the application of expert system in credit scoring and distress prediction through applying diverse DEA models to compute corporate market efficiency in addition to the prevailing managerial efficiency, and to estimate the decomposed measure of mix efficiency and investigate its contribution compared to Pure Technical Efficiency and Scale Efficiency in the performance of DPMs. Further, this paper provides a comprehensive comparison between two-stage DPMs through estimating a variety of DEA efficiency measures in the first stage and employing static and dynamic classifiers in the second stage. Based on experimental results, guidelines are provided to help practitioners develop two-stage DPMs; to be more specific, guidelines are provided to assist with the choice of the proper DEA models to use in the first stage, and the choice of the best corporate efficiency measures and classifiers to use in the second stage.

AB  - While many studies pointed out that travellers often consider a basket of factors when they are selecting their accommodation, few online travel agency websites allow the travellers to actively express their preference about the selection criteria in order to receive tailor-made recommendations in return. The absence of this feature causes travellers to spend extra effort and time to compare the hotel options themselves. This paper presents a decision support algorithm, namely Vague Set TOPSIS, to help travellers to rank the hotel options. It was found in this research that the structure and assumptions of the conventional TOPSIS methods are not suitable for handling this decision problem. Therefore, this paper is novel in providing a foundational change to the conventional TOPSIS models such that it is more applicable to hotel selection. The validity of the proposed decision support algorithm was proved via three approaches, which are mathematical proofs, computer stochastic simulation experiments and a numerical case study using data obtained from Hotels.com.

AB  - Nowadays risks become a critical part in our life since they are involved in everything we do and participate. Some people do not want to do anything which associated with risk and others flourish on risk. In both types of people, they must relieve their risk through utilizing safety measures such as flame retardant suits and helmets for race car drivers, and safety ropes for rock climbers. All risks can be minimized to a manageable level by employing the proper mitigation strategy. In supply chain, the decisionmaking process contains risks which can be influential on the company’s progress in introducing a new product, expanding in various markets, and outsourcing manufacturing operations. Companies will be likely to perform well via considering risks in their decisions and employing the proper mitigation strategy for responding to the unexpected events The subjectivity, uncertainty and vagueness which exist in reality are the key factors to make risks difficult to handle Hence, risk analysis, mitigation and control provide recommendations for making suitable decisions. In order to quantify risks in supply chain, an integrated method with a neutrosophic analytical hierarchy process (N-AHP) and neutrosophic technique has been demonstrated for this purpose. It is aimed for matching similarity to the ideal solution (N-TOPSIS) by order preference. The neutrosophic values in our research can deal effectively and efficiently with vague, uncertain and in incomplete information which has a significant impact on risk management. For illustrating the suggested methodology, a real case study is illustrated.

AB  - The main goal of green supply chain management is to minimize the injurious ecological impacts in all activities and phases of a supply chain. Evaluating the suppliers and selecting the best one based on environmental criteria can facilitate us to reach the objective of green supply chain management. As the assessment generally consists of various alternatives over different criteria, green supplier selection is regarded as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. Hesitant fuzzy set, which is an extension of fuzzy set, is an effective tool to handle the vagueness in such a way that hesitant and flawed information by allowing the degree of belongingness for a green supplier selection over the evaluation criteria. In this paper, an integrated method is developed based on Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) approach to solve the multi-criteria decision-making problems with hesitant fuzzy information. This method is based on hesitant fuzzy operators, some improvement in the conventional WASPAS approach and a procedure for calculating the criteria weights. To calculate the criteria and decision expert weights, we propose new information measures for hesitant fuzzy sets and combine entropy and divergence measures for criteria weights, while we use similarity measure for decision expert weights. Since the uncertainty is an inevitable feature of multi-criteria decision-making problems, the developed approach can be a useful tool for uncertain multi-criteria decision-making atmosphere. Next, a green supplier selection problem is taken to show the usefulness of the developed approach in real-life decision-making problems. The results of this study found that the most significant criteria for green supplier selection were management commitment (0.3119), environmental management system (0.2259) and green product (0.2010). Also, we demonstrate a sensitivity analysis over different parameter values and sets of criteria weight to illustrate the stability of the developed method. Finally, the outcome developed approach with existing approaches is compared to validate the developed method.

AB  - Cloud detection algorithms have emerged to automate image data analysis because of its prime influential factor in remote sensing image quality. Cloud detection algorithm still needs domain-expert intervention and large number of training examples to ensure good performance whose acquirement becomes difficult due to unavailability of labeled data as well as the time and process heads involved. The paper puts forward multi-objective social spider optimization (MOSSO) based efficient clustering technique to detect clouds in the visible range. This paper explains the proposed MOSSO algorithm along-with the analysis carried on 14 benchmark two-objective test problems against MOEA/D, MODE, MOPSO and SPEA2 multi-objective algorithms. Further, the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed algorithm are analyzed and have been used for the implementation of an efficient clustering technique named as MOSSO-C. Optimal centroid matrix for clustering is attained in MOSSO-C through environmental selection whose performance evaluation has been done on six synthetic databases and are compared with above mentioned conventional multi-objective algorithms. The obtained results encourage the use of MOSSO-C technique to get labeled data for training process of neural network classifier. This approach efficiently classifies the cloudy pixels against various Earth’s surfaces (water, vegetation and land). The paper also discusses the performance evaluation of proposed technique on four Landsat 8 data which shows on an average 96.37% performance accuracy in detecting cloudy pixels.

AB  - Estimation of landslide susceptibility is still an ongoing requirement for land use management plans. Here, we proposed two novel intelligence hybrid models that rely on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and two metaheuristic optimization algorithms, i.e., grey wolf optimizer (GWO) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO), for obtaining a reliable estimate of landslide susceptibility. Sixteen causative factors and 391 historical landslide events from a landslide-prone area of the State of Uttarakhand, northern India, were used to generate a geospatial database. The ANFIS model was employed to develop an initial landslide susceptibility model that was then optimized using the GWO and BBO algorithms. This resulted in two novel models, i.e., ANFIS-BBO and ANFIS-GWO, that benefited from an intelligent approach to automatically and properly adjust the best parameters of the base ANFIS model for the prediction of landslide susceptibilities. The robustness of the models was verified through a large number of runs using different splits of training and validation datasets. Although few differences observed between the predictive capability of the models (AUCANFIS-BBO = 0.95; RMSEANFIS-BBO = 0.316 vs. ACUANFIS-GWO = 0.94; RMSEANFIS-GWO = 0.322), the Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated a significant difference between the model performances in both training and validation datasets. Overall, our proposed models demonstrated an improved prediction of landslides compared to those achieved in previous studies with other methods. Therefore, these novel models can be recommended for modeling landslide susceptibility, and the modelers can easily tailor their use based on their individual circumstances.

AB  - Chromatography remains the workhorse in antibody purification; however process development and characterisation still require significant resources. The high number of operating parameters involved requires extensive experimentation, traditionally performed at small- and pilot-scale, leading to demands in terms of materials and time that can be a challenge. The main objective of this research was the establishment of a novel High Throughput Process Development (HTPD) workflow combining scale-down chromatography experimentation with advanced decision-support techniques in order to minimise the consumption of resources and accelerate the development timeframe. Additionally, the HTPD workflow provides a framework to rapidly manipulate large datasets in an automated fashion. The central component of the HTPD workflow is the systematic integration of a microscale chromatography experimentation strategy with an advanced chromatogram evaluation method, design of experiments (DoE) and multivariate data analysis. The outputs of this are leveraged into the screening and optimisation components of the workflow. For the screening component, a decision-support tool was developed combining different multi-criteria decision-making techniques to enable a fair comparison of a number of CEX resin candidates and determine those that demonstrate superior purification performance. This provided a rational methodology for screening chromatography resins and process parameters. For the optimisation component, the workflow leverages insights provided through screening experimentation to guide subsequent DoE experiments so as to tune significant process parameters for the selected resin. The resulting empirical correlations are linked to a stochastic modelling technique so as to predict the optimal and most robust chromatographic process parameters to achieve the desired performance criteria.

AB  - Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women. The selection of an effective, patient-specific treatment plan for breast cancer has been a challenge for physicians because the decision process involves a vast number of treatment alternatives as well as treatment decision criteria, such as the stage of the cancer (e.g., in situ, invasive, metastasis), tumor characteristics, biomarker-related risks, and patient-related risks. Furthermore, every patient's case is unique, requiring a patient-specific treatment plan, while there is no standard procedure even for a particular stage of the breast cancer. In this paper, we first determine a comprehensive set of criteria for selecting the best breast cancer therapy by interviewing medical oncologists and reviewing the literature. We then present two analytical hierarchy process (AHP) models for quantifying the weights of criteria for breast cancer treatment in two sequential steps: primary and secondary treatment therapy. Using the weights of criteria from the AHP model, we propose a new multi-criteria ranking algorithm (MCRA), which evaluates a large variety of patient scenarios and provides the best patient-tailored breast cancer treatment alternatives based on the input of nine medical oncologists. We then validate the predictions of the multi-criteria ranking algorithm by comparing treatment ranks of the algorithm with ranks of five different oncologists, and show that algorithm rankings match or are statistically significantly correlated with the overall expert ranking in most cases. Our multi-criteria ranking algorithm could be used as an accessible decision-support tool to aid oncologists and educate patients for determining appropriate and effective treatment alternatives for breast cancer. Our approach is also general in the sense that it could be adapted to solve other complex decision-making problems in medicine, healthcare, as well as other service and manufacturing industries.

KW  - Participatory scenarios
AB  - In a world where an increasing share of the population lives in cities, its energy transition is gaining more relevance. The decision-making process in urban planning is frequently fragmented across departments considering different criteria. Integrated city planning approaches are not commonly employed, especially for the promotion of sustainable energy. This paper presents an innovative approach to promote holistic decision-support combining complex integrated city energy system models (ESM) with effective stakeholder input using a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). A holistic optimization city-ESM, based on the TIMES model generator, was developed and implemented in four European cities (Évora in Portugal, Cesena in Italy, Nottingham in UK and Trikala in Greece). Each city defined a range of future scenarios for sustainable energy promotion up to 2030 which were modelled in the city-ESM. The scenarios considered both individual measures, such as expansion of bicycle lanes, and combinations of measures. Going one step further from typical approaches in urban energy modelling, the modelling work was carried out in close cooperation with city stakeholders whom participated not only in the definition of the modelled scenarios, but also on the critical review of the modelling results. This review was conducted through a MCDA exercise which considered both quantitative and qualitative criteria in the selection of candidate scenarios to be implemented. It was found that there are substantial differences in most desirable scenarios if the MCDA is performed as well or if only the city-ESM model results are considered. The critical review of quantitative modelling results and their ranking via the MCDA led to improved communication of model results to non-modellers, which in turn made possible a better scrutiny and improvement of the modelling. It is concluded that at an urban level is important to combine qualitative analysis with quantitative modelling to identify the optimum mix of measures for a sustainable urban energy future.

AB  - Handling outliers are one of the primary concerns of today’s data mining techniques. The concept of outliers, it’s handling, and diagnosis is context specific and varies according to the field of application. The existence of outliers while mining web data is inevitable by virtue of unique characteristic features exhibited by a typical web user. As the output of a regression algorithm is always different from the actual value, it poses a challenge to the knowledge workers and researchers about the notion of an outlier in such cases. In this paper, we propose to develop the concept of an outlier with respect to regression analysis of any Web-based dataset. A framework to find outliers in the output of a regression algorithm is being formulated with the help of Ordered Weighted operators. The underlying idea is to find an error rectification value, ϵ, that will work, in association with the predicted value from the regression model and then help to distinguish an outlier. This will, in addition, also provide a possible range of deviation from the predicted output. A case study on a web dataset is being done to show the usefulness of the proposed approach.

AB  - As a common task for choosing a group of representatives, the problem of approval voting has been studied in contexts varying from democratic elections, to sports, to products marketing, and to multi-criteria decision making. In these applications, the length of individual ballots is often enforced, but how many candidates should be approved in an individual ballot is still a puzzling question. The experimental framework we present here endeavors to understand the impact of ballot-length in the effectiveness of election outcomes. Our results suggest that: (1) given the number of voters and candidates, the effectiveness of election outcome is U-shaped in the variance of individual ballot-length; (2) the determination of the optimal ballot-length critically depends on the accuracy of ballots; (3) more voters bring more effective election outcomes. Our study of how ballot length affects the effectiveness of election outcome provides new insights into an understudied area, and it can serve as a starting point for future studies of the approval balloting-based elections in other retail contexts.

AB  - Gully erosion susceptibility mapping is a fundamental tool for land-use planning aimed at mitigating land degradation. However, the capabilities of some state-of-the-art data-mining models for developing accurate maps of gully erosion susceptibility have not yet been fully investigated. This study assessed and compared the performance of two different types of data-mining models for accurately mapping gully erosion susceptibility at a regional scale in Chavar, Ilam, Iran. The two methods evaluated were: Certainty Factor (CF), a bivariate statistical model; and Maximum Entropy (ME), an advanced machine learning model. Several geographic and environmental factors that can contribute to gully erosion were considered as predictor variables of gully erosion susceptibility. Based on an existing differential GPS survey inventory of gully erosion, a total of 63 eroded gullies were spatially randomly split in a 70:30 ratio for use in model calibration and validation, respectively. Accuracy assessments completed with the receiver operating characteristic curve method showed that the ME-based regional gully susceptibility map has an area under the curve (AUC) value of 88.6% whereas the CF-based map has an AUC of 81.8%. According to jackknife tests that were used to investigate the relative importance of predictor variables, aspect, distance to river, lithology and land use are the most influential factors for the spatial distribution of gully erosion susceptibility in this region of Iran. The gully erosion susceptibility maps produced in this study could be useful tools for land managers and engineers tasked with road development, urbanization and other future development.

AB  - In the pre-feasibility study stage of freeway construction, road engineers attempt to select an optimal scheme with the aim of guiding follow-up design and construction work. This requires the consideration of multiple fuzzy factors which formats a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. The aim of this study is to develop a MCDM method reflecting the decision information significantly. Firstly, Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) and improved FTOPSIS (I-FTOPSIS) for selecting freeway route scheme were analyzed, and then developed FTOPSIS (D-FTOPSIS) was proposed to better reflect the decision information. Then, the above three methods were adopted to sort route schemes of Lianhua section of Chaohui freeway, respectively. Finally, consistency and distinction of results obtained from the three methods were comparatively discussed. In addition, the significance of D-FTOPSIS method for reflecting decision information was proved through the case analysis. Results indicated that the relative closeness (RC)of each alternative scheme calculated by the three methods is different, but the ranking of alternative schemes are consistent, indicating that the proposed D-FTOPSIS method is reasonable. The more important conclusion is that the D-FTOPSIS method is more sensitive to weights of attributes. In summary, the D-FTOPSIS proposed by this study is effective and can be used for optimizing route scheme, particularly for cases when the decision information of experts need to be reflected as much as possible.

AB  - A new generation of bike-sharing services is emerging in China. With this service, bikes can be unlocked and paid by using a smartphone and then picked up and left anywhere at users' convenience. The unprecedented development of dockless bike-sharing services results in considerable socioeconomic and environmental benefits but also creates new urban issues. One of the most severe issues is users’ inappropriate parking behaviour. To solve this problem, electric fence (or geo-fence) policy and technology have been introduced in China to guide users to park bikes in designated zones. In this paper, we first propose a methodological framework to support electric fence planning for dockless bike-sharing services. We then apply our framework in a case study of Shanghai using a big dataset of bike trips. Results show that when the number of planned electric fences is 7,500, our electric fence plan can cover 91.8% of total parking demand. In addition, our plan can ensure that at least 95.8% of all bikes can be docked at one of planned electric fences and can help efficiently and accurately determine suitable locations for setting up planned electric fences.

AB  - Record keeping systems are gaining more importance in addressing safety problems in megaprojects. The information recorded is being converted into large data domains since it has become necessary to examine problems down to the last detail to deal with them properly. Due to a high number of attributes and the type of information, the data has a high level of heterogeneity. The aim of this paper is to propose an innovative safety assessment methodology to predict the possible scenarios and determine preventative actions. The study introduces predictive models based on factual information and shows how to deal with the safety data which has a significant level of heterogeneity. Latent Class Clustering Analysis (LCCA) was performed to reduce the heterogeneity and extract homogenous subgroups from the data. For predictive purposes, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) were employed to estimate the outcome of incidents in terms of severity. CBR gave promising results and exhibited better performance than ANN. CBR achieved results in 86% of the test cases with 18% error at most. Moreover, the overall prediction accuracy of fatal incidents was equal to 86.33%. As a final step, the study presented preventative actions to eliminate safety failures. Ultimately, the proposed methodology can assist construction industry professionals in examining future safety problems by utilizing the collected large scale data. Furthermore, the study provides necessary preventative measures to be implemented before and during the construction stage.

AB  - Rule learning is a special type of machine learning approaches, and its key advantage is the generation of interpretable models, which provides a transparent process of showing how an input is mapped to an output. Traditional rule learning algorithms are typically based on Boolean logic for inducing rule antecedents, which are very effective for training models on data sets that involve discrete attributes only. When continuous attributes are present in a data set, traditional rule learning approaches need to employ crisp intervals. However, in reality, problems usually show shades of grey, which motivated the development of fuzzy rule learning approaches by employing fuzzy intervals for handling continuous attributes. While a data set contains a large portion of discrete attributes or even no continuous attributes, fuzzy approaches cannot be used to learn rules effectively, leading to a drop in the performance. In this paper, a multi-stage approach of mixed rule learning is proposed, which involves strategic combination of both traditional and fuzzy approaches to handle effectively various types of attributes. We compare our proposed approach with existing algorithms of rule learning. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach leads to significant advances in the performance compared with the existing algorithms.

AB  - This study presents a novel framework to optimize Low Impact Development (LID) practices for urban storm water management. First, the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) model was executed for different possible scenarios of input parameters and various LIDs to simulate runoff volume, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) loads. Next, a neural network (MLP-ANN) was trained and validated, as a surrogate model, against the set of inputs and output variables from the SWMM model simulations. The inherent uncertainties in the rainfall-runoff modeling were accounted for using a Nonlinear Interval Number Programming (NINP) model, and stakeholders' interactions are considered using a leader-follower game model. Velenjak urban watershed in Tehran, Iran, with four key stakeholders was considered as the study area. Tehran Municipality is the financial service provider that makes the first decision the leader-follower structure, and is considered as the leader with the priority of minimizing LIDs’ construction and maintenance costs. Tehran Department of Environmental Protection, Tehran Regional Water company, and Tehran Province Water and Wastewater company are the main followers in the decision making structure in the study area. This game theoretical framework yields several Pareto optimal solutions given the conflicting utilities of various players, and a Multi Criteria Decision Making procedure – i.e. PROMETHEE model – selects the most preferred compromised option. Fourteen weighting scenarios were considered in the PROMETHEE model to determine the compromise solution among the 52 solutions on the trade-off curve. The novelty of this study lies in using a nonlinear interval conflict resolution multi-objective optimization model for urban storm water management based on a leader-follower game. The proposed methodology warrants BOD and TSS loads, as well as storm water volume, are all reduced, with the highest reductions of 93, 86 and 90 percent, respectively. Results testify to the efficacy of the proposed model for urban storm water management.

Rezaei, Best-worst multi-criteria decision-making method, Omega 53 (2015) 49–57), it has attracted many scholars’ attention due to the efficiency of this method in reducing the times of pairwise comparisons and the good performance in maintaining consistency between judgments. Lots of researches related to this method have been published over the past several years. This paper concentrates on the state-of-the-art survey of the BWM based on the in-depth analysis over the publications concerning this method published from 2015 to 26th, January 2019. This paper intends to answer five questions about the BWM: (1) How does this method perform in bibliometric analysis? (2) Why to propose this method and what is it? (3) Which integrations that the BWM were focused on and which areas did they apply to? (4) What extensions of this method were investigated? (5) What are the challenges and future research directions regarding this method? In view of the fact that the research on this method is still in infancy, this paper has guiding significance for the later research related to the BWM. From the theoretical point of view, the reasonable value of consistency ratio, the inconsistency improving methods, the uncertain extensions of the BWM and the techniques for solving multi-optimality model in the BWM are good research issues that need to be further investigated in the future. From the perspective of application, the software packages for this method, the various integrations of this method, the wider application areas, and the international cooperation on this method are good topics to consider.

KW  - Incremental approximation calculation
AB  - Feature selection plays an important role in data mining and machine learning tasks. Rough set theory has been a prominent tool for this purpose. It characterizes a dataset by using two important measures called lower and upper approximation. Dominance based rough set approach (DSRA) is an extension to conventional rough set theory. It is based on persistence of preference order while extracting knowledge from datasets. Dominance principal states that objects belonging to a certain decision class should follow the preference order. Preference order states that an object having higher values of conditional attributes should belong to higher decision classes. However, some of the basic concepts like checking preference order consistency of a dataset, dominance based lower approximation and upper approximation are computationally too expensive to be used for large datasets. In this paper, we have proposed a parallel incremental approach called Parallel Incremental Approximation Calculation or PIAC for short, for calculating these measures of lower and upper approximations. The proposed approach incrementally calculates lower and upper approximations using parallel threads. We compare our method with the conventional approach using ten widely used datasets. Whilst achieving the same accuracy levels as the conventional approach, our approach significantly reduces the average computation time, i.e., 71% for the lower approximation and 70% for the upper approximation. Over all datasets, the decrease in memory usage achieved was 99%.

Its main purpose is to compare different types of projects (hospitals, schools, museums, etc.) and to prioritize the investments that present the most favourable global results. The methodology, known as MIVES, constructs a model that assists decision-making on the basis of consistent and transparent criteria. It incorporates the value function concept that attaches a value to different types of variables for the purpose of arriving at a final value in relation to pre-defined criteria. In this study, the model is based on the three basic pillars of sustainability (economy, environment, and society) presented in a triple-layer decision tree. Its application to four urban projects, presented as examples, showed encouraging results with a wide range of values.

AB  - Modern-day maintenance optimization decisions are complex problems which need to satisfy multiple and conflicting criteria. With increased applications and recent advances in multi criteria optimization (MCO) approaches, a review is needed to collate and categorize these advances in the Maintenance domain. This paper reports on a review of multi criteria models applied for solving maintenance optimization problems. The review process identified 259 publications in the MCO area. A generalized decision making process for addressing MCO problems is developed. A total of 150 publications addressing maintenance related MCO applications were selected and analyzed in this work. Over 100 popularly applied criteria, 21 alternatives and 24 constraints were identified when defining the MCO problem for maintenance. The results have illustrated two main classes of maintenance MCO problems as strategy selection and interval optimization. The strength of Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) MCO techniques for handling larger numbers of descriptive criteria make them more suitable for strategy selection problems while Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been the preferred choice for solving MCO interval optimization problems. Recently enhanced techniques in maintenance and related areas are highlighted and developments and improvements made noted. This work should assist researchers and practitioners in considering advanced MCO approaches.

AB  - The increasing in energy demand leads to wide range of blackout crises around the worldwide. Load management is represented as one of the most important solutions to balance the energy demand with the available generation resource. Dynamic and adaptive method is required to sort all multi-objective sets of optimal solutions of customer load scheduling. A multi-objective optimization differential evolution (MODE) algorithm in this paper is used to obtain a set of optimal customer load management by minimizing the energy cost and customer’s inconvenience simultaneously. The obtained optimal set of solutions are sorted from the best to the worst using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods. An integration of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and technique for order preferences by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) are used as MCDM methods. The effect of different time slots on the given optimal solutions are addressed for real customer’s data of a typical household. Results of simulation indicate that the proposed method manages to realize energy cost saving of 44%, 44% and 32% for 1, 5 and 10 min time slots, respectively. Moreover, the peak load savings are 42%, 31% and 41% for 1, 5 and 10 min time slots, respectively. Furthermore, the results are validated by other approaches presented earlier in literature to support the findings of the proposed method. The proposed method provides superior saving for energy cost and peak consumption as well as maintains an acceptable range of customer inconvenience.

AB  - Withthedevelopmentofeconomyandtheimprovementofpeople'slivingstandard, health has become one of the most important things that people pay attention to. Lung cancer, as one of the most serious malignant tumors threatening people's health, has a high mortality rate and a low cure rate for the reason that the early symptoms of it are not obvious. Usually, when a patient is found to have lung cancer, s/he is already at the middle or even the advanced stage. The early screening of lung cancer is of great significance for the effective treatment of lung cancer. The lung cancer screening process can be seen as a multi-criteria decision making problem. However, the nature of making a right decision for lung cancer screening is unstructured and complex since there are many factors that may affect such decisions. Furthermore, these factors are usually vague and difficult to evaluate precisely and numerically. The hesitant fuzzy set is a powerful tool to deal with uncertain and ambiguous information and has better applicability in quantifying such information. This study establishes a framework that uses the double normalization-based multi-aggregation method to solve the lung cancer screening problem. The critical factors for lung cancer screening are obtained by the fuzzy Delphi method. We adopt an illustrative example that is related to the lung cancer screening in a hospital of China to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Furthermore, a comparison analysis is provided to verify the stability of the proposed method.

AB  - This research focuses on the selection of the optimum process parameters for Aegel marmelos (AM) pyrolysis experiment based on multi-objective decision-making techniques. This investigation presents the optimization report for obtaining maximum pyrolysis oil from AM de-oiled seed cake through thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis) process. The pyrolysis process has been conducted according to L27 orthogonal array with chosen input control factors such as pyrolysis temperature (°C), heating rate (°C/min) and biomass particle size (mm). The output response parameters measured are the bio-oil yield, bio-char yield and biogas yield. The multi-objective decision-making approach namely Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and Grey relational analysis (GRA) techniques are employed to determine the optimum pyrolysis process parameters to maximize the yield of AM bio-oil. The optimized values of pyrolysis temperature (PT), heating rate (HR) and feedstock particle size (PS) are 600 °C, 10 °C/min and 0.6 mm. At peak engine loading condition, 20% AM bio-oil + 80% diesel fuel blend (AM20) emit lower carbon dioxide (CO2 = 8.68%) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx = 1401 ppm) emissions as compared with diesel (D) CO2 (10.33%) and NOx (1511 ppm) emissions. The association between exhaust gas temperature and NOx emission was inferred using a novel approach of thermal imager by sensing the infrared rays from the hot surface of the exhaust port. Infrared thermal images are captured during the engine operations fuelled with bio-oil at the optimum pyrolysis conditions concluded by TOPSIS and GRA results (PT = 600 °C, HR = 10 °C/min and PS = 0.6 mm). According to the thermal imaging result, AM20 blend produces the lower amount of NOx emissions compared with neat diesel and it is suggested that AM bio-oil can be used as engine fuel instead in order to preserve the eco-system stability and biodiversity.

AB  - An entropy-based method is presented to model a decision-maker’s (DM’s) subjective utility for a criterion value. The proposed method considers distribution of all the values that the criterion takes for the given set of alternatives. Based on the utility so modeled, and and the DM’s attitudinal character, a multi criteria decision aiding (MCDA) approach is developed to find the best alternative. The proposed method and the approach are applied in a real car selection case-study.

AB  - This study aims to propose (i) a multi-view text classification method and (ii) a ranking method that allows for selecting the best information fusion layer among many variations. Multi-view document classification is worth a detailed study as it makes it possible to combine different feature sets into yet another view that further improves text classification. For this purpose, we propose a multi-view framework for text classification that is composed of two levels of information fusion. At the first level, classifiers are constructed using different data views, i.e. different vector space models by various machine learning algorithms. At the second level, the information fusion layer uses input information using a features projection method and a meta-classifier modelled by a selected machine learning algorithm. A final decision based on classification results produced by the models positioned at the first layer is reached. Moreover, we propose a ranking method to assess various configurations of the fusion layer. We use heuristics that utilise statistical properties of F-score values calculated for classification results produced at the fusion layer. The information fusion layer of the classification framework and ranking method has been empirically evaluated. For this purpose, we introduce a use case checking whether companies’ domains identify their innovativeness. The results empirically demonstrate that the information fusion layer enhances classification quality. The Friedman’s aligned rank and Wilcoxon signed-rank statistical tests and the effect size support this hypothesis. In addition, the Spearman statistical test carried out for the obtained results demonstrated that the assessment made by the proposed ranking method converges to a well-established method named Hellinger - The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (H-TOPSIS). Thus, the proposed approach may be used for the assessment of classifier performance.

AB  - The patient care processes in hospitals are supported by a range of operational activities including inventory management and distribution of supplies to point-of-care locations. Hospitals carry large amounts and a great variety of items, and the issues of storing and distributing these items throughout the hospital supply chain are of great importance to providing high-quality patient service. Healthcare logistics encompasses the process of handling physical goods (e.g. pharmaceuticals, surgical medical products, medical equipment, sterile items, linen, food, etc.) and the associated information flows, from the reception of the goods within a hospital to their delivery at patient care locations. The medical supply costs constitute the second largest expenditure in hospitals, after personnel costs. A high-performing supply chain may realize improved outcomes (e.g. safe and quality patient service) and greater efficiency. Logistics managers need to identify opportunities to improve the logistics processes in order to lower costs and to improve patient care quality. However, in order to improve the logistics processes, you must understand how the healthcare supply chain is currently performing. Measuring the performance of the supply chain is fundamental to identify and address deficiencies in the logistics activities, and it serves as a good input for managerial decision-making. The purpose of this article is to present existing research on performance measurement at the internal hospital supply chain (e.g. inventory management, distribution activities), and more specifically in the operating theatre since it is among the most critical resources for a hospital. At the operating theatre, the requested items should be available at the right time at the right place, in the right condition, at the lowest cost possible. Furthermore, we will also discuss literature on multi-criteria decision-making techniques. It enables researchers to build a performance measurement framework and to prioritize between multiple performance indicators since a diverse group of stakeholders with conflicting interests is involved in the internal operating room supply chain.

AB  - Assessing environmentally sustainable GW management (ESGM) needs a deep knowledge of the present and the projected status of GW (GW) quantity and quality. Translations of these data into policy relevant information are usually done through quantitative indices. Despite the availability of a dozen GW sustainability indicators, defining an integrated index based on internationally accepted scientific standards indicators is required. To fill this gap, an in-depth review on the developed indicators/index for evaluation of GW sustainable management (GWSM) from an environmental viewpoint at aquifer scales is provided in this study. Thirteen environmentally related quantitative indicators are adopted for assessment of GWSM, especially in arid regions, depending upon data availability, and relevance of indicators. An integrated ESGM index (ESGMI) is developed based on weighted aggregation of thirteen adopted indicators through multi criteria decision making (MCDM) methods. ESGMI value ranged between 0 and 100, zero value denotes to the worst state or unsustainable GW management (GWM) and 100 indicates the ideal state or GWM is sustainable. Thirty important aquifers across Iran are chosen to implement the ESGMI at the national scale of a country known to be the fifth largest global GW user. ESGMI values for thirty of Iran's aquifers are obtained in the range 15.40 to 68.50 (on average, 49.96). This reveals the unsustainable status of GWM in this country. The results of this study demonstrate that the ESGMI is a promising tool to determine the current state of GW quantity and quality, reveals the effect of policy actions and plans, and contributes to the development and operation of effective sustainable management policies for GW resources. Due to uncertainties and spatio-temporal variabilities of key controlling variables in GW management, sustainability evaluation should be understood as a dynamic and iterative process, requiring persistent monitoring, analysis, prioritization, and modification.

AB  - Driven by ‘success stories’ reported by private sector firms, government agencies have also started adopting various Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in diverse domains (e.g. health, taxation, and education); however, extensive research is required in order to exploit the full potential of AI in the public sector, and leverage various AI technologies to address important problems/needs. This paper makes a contribution in this direction: it presents a novel approach, as well as the architecture of an ICT platform supporting it, for the advanced exploitation of a specific AI technology, namely chatbots, in the public sector in order to address a crucial issue: the improvement of communication between government and citizens (which has for long time been problematic). The proposed approach builds on natural language processing, machine learning and data mining technologies, and leverages existing data of various forms (such as documents containing legislation and directives, structured data from government agencies' operational systems, social media data, etc.), in order to develop a new digital channel of communication between citizens and government. Making use of appropriately structured and semantically annotated data, this channel enables ‘richer’ and more expressive interaction of citizens with government in everyday language, facilitating and advancing both information seeking and conducting of transactions. Compared to existing digital channels, the proposed approach is appropriate for a wider range of citizens' interactions, with higher levels of complexity, ambiguity and uncertainty. In close co-operation with three Greek government agencies (the Ministry of Finance, a social security organization, and a big local government organization), this approach has been validated through a series of application scenarios.

AB  - Despite the many services and virtually infinite resources offered by cloud computing such as virtual reality and intelligent building surveillance, it still faces many problems when intervening several smart objects and devices in human's life. These problems are low latency, mobility and location awareness. For solving these problems of cloud computing, the fog and mobile edge computing have been introduced. The fog and mobile edge computing (FMEC) make services and resources close to users via moving from cloud data centers to the edge of the network. The dependability of FMEC depends on supplying centric services to users. The FMEC considered as a perfect paradigm to the above-mentioned purpose due to their ability to implement the ponderous real time applications directly at the network edge via billions of linked mobile devices. The FMEC faces some challenges as in any novel technology. These challenges are security (network security, data security, privacy of usage, data storage security, etc.) and administrative policies concerns. The critical problem which prohibit the development of FMEC is how to address dynamic varying of security services with the requirements of mobile's users. For handling this problem, we sought to provide a method for selecting the proper security service which is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. In this research, we provide a neutrosophic PROMETHEE (preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation) technique for multi-criteria decision making problems to describe fuzzy information efficiently. For assessing the proposed methodology we applied it to a real case study to select proper security service for FMEC in the presence of fuzzy information.

AB  - The leisure, travel, tourism and hospitality industry have been one of the sectors that contributed to the most to the global economy and employee deployment from the past to the present. However, with the rapid technological developments in recent years and the guests who have adapted to these developments, the companies operating in this field have started to feel the need to respond to changing behaviors and demands. The effects of digital transformation have begun to appear in the hospitality industry. However, the service quality phenomenon that determines the performances of the firms and provides them competitiveness and profitability has continued to exist. Companies need to focus on service quality from another perspective. In this study, strategic service quality analysis was performed with the digital transformation perspective in the hospitality industry. The SERVQUAL model, a classic service quality model, has been rearranged with a digital transformation perspective and a new service quality model is proposed for the digital hospitality industry. Criteria weights are obtained by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) which is one of the multi-criteria decision-making techniques. Evaluation processes of decision makers and calculations are carried out in intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) environment to eliminate uncertainties and vagueness. Priority weights are used to rank the criteria.

AB  - The three-pillar concept of environmental, economic, and social sustainability is widely known in academia. Research on sustainable development has noted its complex nature, also reflected in the decision-making process, which requires structuration and systematization. To support decision making for sustainable development, many multi-criteria techniques, both isolated or integrated, have been used. Among them, the analytic hierarchy process stands out as the most often used. This study conducts a systematic literature review on the analytic hierarchy process's support for decision making for sustainable development, making it possible to identify gaps and future research pathways. To do so, it gathers, maps, analyzes, and summarizes the academic literature by reviewing 173 manuscripts published between 2014 and 2018, which are indexed by the Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct databases. The results, analysis, and discussion of the screened manuscripts are comprised of (a) a descriptive analysis, (b) mental mapping, (c) bibliometric data, (d) an in-depth analysis of the most cited literature, (e) an in-depth analysis of the most recently cited literature, and (f) the clustering of research evolution. The findings substantially elucidate the advancements in the state-of-the-art of the analytic hierarchy process for sustainable development. Implications for research and practice, as well as promising challenges for further research, are presented.

The drivers and barriers are identified through literature research and a survey is conducted for their evaluation. The results show that barriers more commonly present and interconnected in companies originate from internal management, while drivers often originate from external stakeholders. The paper concludes with policy recommendation, which will facilitate the adoption of eco-deign practices for sustainable manufacturing in the Finnish pulp and paper industry. The ranking of the barriers and drivers from different point of view will help the decision-makers and managers in government and industry to mitigate these barriers in an effective manner.

AB  - Supplier selection is the process by which firms identify, evaluate, and contract with suppliers. The supplier selection process deploys an enormous amount of a firm’s financial resources and plays crucial role for the success of any organization. The main objective of supplier selection process is to reduce purchase risk, maximize overall value to the purchaser, and develop closeness and long-term relationships between buyers and suppliers. The literature on supplier selection criteria and methods is full of various analytical approaches. Some researchers have developed hybrid models by combining more than one type of selection methods. The current paper provides an overall picture of research on supply chain management, supplier selection criteria and supplier selection evaluation methods (multi-criteria decision making). A summary of the process of supplier selection can be helpful for companies to have a clear understanding of the concept in order to improve their success and competitiveness. The results show that the application of a structured decision-making technique is vital, especially under the complex conditions that include both qualitative and quantitative criteria.

AB  - Many strategies are under investigation to reduce the environmental impact of the building stock. Among them, the implementation of optimal operation strategies of the HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) systems plays a fundamental role because it can produce substantial energy-economic savings and increment of thermal comfort. In this vein, a weather-data-based control framework is here proposed to provide optimal heating operation strategies easily applicable to a huge number of buildings. It works by coupling EnergyPlus and MATLAB® to run a multi-objective genetic algorithm and proposes a novel approach for multi-criteria decision-making. This latter addresses characteristic days (i.e., average cold days, average days and average hot days) of weather data files with the aim to provide monthly heating strategies that ensure the best compromise between running cost and thermal discomfort. As case studies, the proposed framework is applied to a residential building, representative of the Italian building stock from 1961 to 1975. In order to cover most of the Italian territory, four different cities are considered: Palermo (climatic zone B), Naples (C), Florence (D) and Milan (E). The achieved cost reduction is included between 6% (Milan) and 34% (Palermo), while the thermal comfort is not penalized. Finally, the framework provides practical indications ready to be easily applied to the Italian residential stock to achieve a significant and widespread improvement of energy performance.

The proposed method is applied to empirical US equity data by employing variance, correlation and returns calculated on different observation periods as decision criteria. A total of 440 different configurations are applied to analyze the impact of several parameters in TODIM. Based on the results for the test period, outperforming TODIM configurations are elected. In the validation period, it is empirically demonstrated that portfolios based on outperforming TODIM configurations yield significantly better results than equally weighted portfolios (1/N) and insignificantly inferior results than the minimum variance portfolio (MVP) in terms of the Sharpe ratio. However, TODIM may still be a better choice than MVP for investors sensitive to concentration risk and turnover costs.
