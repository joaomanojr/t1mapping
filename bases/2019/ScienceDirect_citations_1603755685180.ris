AB  - Understanding the response of physical environment to anthropogenic activities assists land use planning aimed at protecting water resources, which prevents society from incurring major economic and social costs. This paper aimed to identify the potential contamination of groundwater by human activity at an outcropping area of Guarani Aquifer System (GAS), the most important hydrogeological unit in South America. The methodology used was based on a multi-criteria analysis using decision matrices to analyze, from algebra mapping in a GIS environment, the influence of rock units, aquifer units, soil classes, steepness, slope shape, and land cover and use in contamination potential. Overall, medium to very high potential for groundwater contamination predominates in the area, amounting to 69.23%. In such areas, when the absence of federal or state law which defines the areas of protection for recharge, the master plans of the municipalities located in the GAS outcropping regions play an important role in complementing the legislation. São Carlos, has its own legislation that aims to control land use in areas of springs, and thereby to protect them. However, the GAS recharge areas near the surface are not contemplated, and specific regulation and standards for deployment of human activity in these areas, have not been established. Therefore, it is suggested that territorial planning to be carried out on a more refined scale. Given that the natural conditions and anthropogenic activities performed in the area of study are reflected in many other periurban wellheads, as well as that of the Guarani Aquifer outcropping are, the decision matrices designed can be applied and serve as an agile tool to define the recharge areas to be protected on a preliminary basis.

AB  - This study provides a new comparative analysis of four hybrid artificial intelligence models for the spatially explicit prediction of wildfire probabilities. Each model consists of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) combined with a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, i.e., genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), and imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA). A spatial database was constructed based on 159 fire events from the Hyrcanian ecoregion (Iran) for which a suite of predictor variables was derived. Each predictor variable was discretized into classes. The step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) procedure was used to assign weights to each class of each predictor variable. Weights indicate the strength of the spatial relationship between each class and fire occurrence and were used for training the hybrid models. The hybrid models were validated using several performance metrics and compared to the single ANFIS model. Although the single ANFIS model outperformed the hybrid models in the training phase, its accuracy decreased considerably in the validation phase. All hybrid models performed well for both training and validation datasets, but the ANFIS-ICA hybrid showed superior predictive performance of spatially explicit wildfire prediction and mapping for the dataset. The results clearly demonstrate the ability of the optimization algorithms to overcome the over-fitting problem of the single ANFIS model at the learning stage of the fire pattern. This study contributes to the suite of research that seeks to obtain reliable estimates of relative likelihoods of natural hazards.

AB  - Objectives:Health care innovation and technologies can improve patient outcomes, but policies and regulations established to protect the public interest may become barriers to improvement of health care delivery. We conducted a scoping review to identify policy and regulatory barriers to, and facilitators of, successful innovation and adoption of health technologies (excluding pharmaceutical and information technologies) in Canada. Methods:The review followed Arksey and O’Malley’s methodology to assess the breadth and depth of literature on this topic and drew upon published and grey literature from 2000-2016. Four reviewers independently screened citations for inclusion. Results:Sixty- seven full- text documents were extracted to collect facilitators and barriers to health technology innovation and adoption. The extraction table was themed using content analysis, and reanalyzed, resulting in facilitators and barriers under six broad themes: development, assessment, implementation, Canadian policy context, partnerships and resources. Conclusion: This scoping review identified current barriers and highlights numerous facilitators to create a responsive regulatory and policy environment that encourages and supports effective co-creation of innovations to optimize patient and economic outcomes while emphasizing the importance of sustainability of health technologies.

AB  - This paper presents a tool for multi-objective cross-domain optimization of heterogenous energy and non-energy domains for urban areas in a comprehensive optimization approach. The multi-objective optimization concept facilitates the definition of any number of objective functions, versatile in their origin and properties, flexibly adaptable to area specifics or regional and communal priorities. The applied optimization for several domains at the lowest system level yields a comprehensive holistic solution optimal for the particular subsystem, as it is fitted for this subsystem according to its characteristics. The main advantage is the exploitation of cross-domain interactions and synergies and, therefore, the improved overall performance of the system. However, the cross-domain approach requires high-level modeling in order to overcome compatibility issues, which decreases the accuracy of domain-specific simulation and optimization compared to methods which apply detailed models. Based on the mathematical concept of multi-objective Pareto optimization, its adaptation, implementation and application in the context of Smart Cities are presented in detail. Several optimization formulations and methods are applied to the test scenario to demonstrate the concept, compare the results and evaluate the computational performance of the application. The ε-constraint method appears to be better suitable for heterogeneous domains, as the weighted sum method is highly sensitive to weight setting for heterogeneous objectives. The computational performance is very good in terms of computation time but meets numerical limitations for samples of around 500 buildings, leading to numerical infeasibility for samples of 1300 buildings. This is solved with the presented method for model aggregation. The tool is available on GitHub.

AB  - Achieving the goals of emissions intensity reduction and energy mix transition along with steady economic growth is a hot topic in China. This paper constructs an economic growth model under emissions reduction control. Using the PLS regression technique, the potential economic growth rates are calculated as 6.64% and 5.35% in 2020 and 2030, respectively. Moreover, employing the Markov chain method and multi-objective optimisation model, we also investigate the evolution trends and the optimisation modes of energy mix in different scenarios. The results show the proportions of clean energy cannot meet the policy targets in the BAU scenario. However, the goal of energy mix can be realized in the “3E” scenario, and a more low-carbon energy consumption structure will be promoted in 2020 and 2030. Furthermore, our results suggest that the Chinese government needs to transform the extensive traditional economic development pattern and strive to achieve the “3E” coordinated development pattern.

AB  - While the measurement and predictability of corruption are reported to be difficult due to its clandestine nature, this paper attempts to develop a measurement model for evaluating the proneness of the procurement process of construction projects to corruption. The model is developed using a soft computing approach (i.e. the Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation technique) to assess the levels of vulnerability with respect to the stages of corruption and their corresponding activities within the procurement process of construction projects. A review of related literature produced a 21-activity list encapsulated within the four stages of the procurement process. The list was evaluated by procurement and construction practitioners through an expert survey. The analysis of the survey results revealed an overall project vulnerability index which suggests that construction projects executed in developing countries are relatively susceptible to corrupt practices. The main stages of the process that were identified to be vulnerable were the contract stage (CTS) and the post-contract phase (PCP). The developed model is, possibly, the first measuring tool that evaluates and predicts a project’s susceptibility to corruption and provides useful insights that can inform project parties, policymakers and anti-corruption activists in their efforts to implement necessary actions aimed at curbing the incidence of corrupt practices in construction projects in the developing countries.

AB  - Supply chain effectiveness and general societal prosperity, as well as economic and ecological productivity will be highly affected in the next decades, entailing challenges for the supply chain and logistics sector. Thereby this sector plays a significant role within the transformation process of economic systems, yet the capacities of it remain up till now underestimated. This paper suggests a holistic approach to assess transformation potential of the supply chain and logistics sector towards more sustainable economic systems while defining innovative business strategies to meet future macroeconomic developments. This is achieved through an integrated assessment of production and consumption systems, considering the interests of the key stakeholders. Moreover, the paper combines advanced methods to develop future macroeconomic scenarios and to assess the strategic business opportunities of the supply chain and logistics sector addressing societal developments, e.g. new consumption patterns. The analysis relies on modern theories of Environmental and Ecological Economics, contributing to transformation theories. Moreover, the innovative role of supply chain and logistics management in achieving sustainable macroeconomic goals at regional and international levels is addressed.

AB  - The nature of natural fibre such as it is lightweight, recyclable, biodegradable and gives a high performance in relation to its mechanical properties makes this material an excellent alternative to currently used materials in the manufacture of automotive components. The significant mechanical properties are identified using the best statistical model suggested by stepwise regression in this study. The estimation and error analysis of the response variables are discussed to select the best natural fibre for automotive component applications. The results using statistical measurement indicate that tensile strength is the most significant mechanical property for all the selected natural fibres. The final ranking that considered high performance score and minimum error analysis for a hand-brake lever application found that coir, kenaf and cotton are the top three candidates with average scores of 4, 4.5 and 5, respectively. The statistical model presented in this study can be used in multiple applications. In fact, this approach is helpful to the design engineer when huge amounts data are involved.

AB  - In recent years, distribution networks have been increasingly affected by the random nature of harmonic sources introduced by nonlinear load and renewable energy sources (RES) such as photovoltaic (PV) systems. This paper presents an approach based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) for the optimal planning of single-tuned passive harmonic filters (PHFs) in a distribution network. The resistance and inductance of the lines within the network are modeled by frequency dependent characteristics. The probabilistic characteristics of the load and PV system currents are also considered for optimal planning of PHFs. In our optimization model, the objective function minimizes the total PHF installation cost and the energy losses, by considering the total harmonic distortion (THD) of bus voltages and maximum capacity of PHF as constraints. The proposed method is validated by a simulation study using an unbalanced three-phase real distribution system. An advantage of this method over most of the conventional approaches is that both harmonic current magnitude and phase angle of real PV systems are taken into account. Numerical results show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Context: Existing software workbenches allow for the deployment of cloud applications across a variety of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers. The expected workload, Quality of Service (QoS) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) must be considered before an appropriate infrastructure is selected. However, this decision-making process is complex and time-consuming. Moreover, the software engineer needs assurances that the selected infrastructure will lead to an adequate QoS of the application. Objective: The goal is to develop a new method for selection of an optimal cloud deployment option, that is, an infrastructure and configuration for deployment and to verify that all hard and as many soft QoS requirements as possible will be met at runtime. Method: A new Formal QoS Assurances Method (FoQoSAM), which relies on stochastic Markov models is introduced to facilitate an automated decision-making process. For a given workload, it uses QoS monitoring data and a user-related metric in order to automatically generate a probabilistic model. The probabilistic model takes the form of a finite automaton. It is further used to produce a rank list of cloud deployment options. As a result, any of the cloud deployment options can be verified by applying a probabilistic model checking approach. Results: Testing was performed by ranking deployment options for two cloud applications, File Upload and Video-conferencing. The FoQoSAM method was compared to a baseline Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results show that the first ranked cloud deployment options satisfy all hard and at least one of the soft requirements for both methods, however, the FoQoSAM method always satisfies at least an additional QoS requirement compared to the baseline AHP method. Conclusions: The proposed new FoQoSAM method is appropriate and can be used in decision-making when ranking and verifying cloud deployment options. Due to its practical utility it was integrated into the SWITCH workbench.

AB  - Humanitarian Supply Chain Management (HSCM) is an emerging field and has gained prominence in recent past. The increasing demand for proper planning has made disaster relief operations (DRO) a complex phenomenon. Moreover, the success of humanitarian supply chain is dependent on various factors which hold different degrees of importance for every DRO. This study considers the case study of floods in India and explores the critical success factors (CSF) for implementation of effective HSCM. The study also models the factors and classifies them into cause and effect using grey decisionmaking trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The study then adopts a sensitivity analysis by considering four scenarios and awarding different weights to the experts to validate the robustness of the results. The results are further validated with a set of experts. The study explored 10 causal enablers and 8 effect-based enablers. Both causal and effect enablers are further clustered using principal component analysis which extracts three factors each. The study proposes a conceptual model which could further be tested using empirical data.

AB  - Identifying a suitable configuration of devices, software and infrastructures in the context of user requirements is fundamental to the success of delivering IoT applications. As possible configurations could be large in number and not all configurations are valid, a configuration knowledge representation model can provide ready-made configurations based on IoT requirements. Combining such a model within the context of a given user-oriented scenario, it is possible to automate the recommendation of solutions for deployment and long-time evolution of IoT applications. However, in the context of Cloud/Edge technologies, that may themselves exhibit significant configuration possibilities that are also dynamic in nature, a more unified approach is required. We present IoT-CANE (Context Aware recommendatioN systEm) as such a unified approach. IoT-CANE embodies a unified conceptual model capturing configuration, constraint and infrastructure features of Cloud/Edge together with IoT devices. The success of IoT-CANE is evaluated through an end-user case study.

AB  - Increasing demand and the current unbalanced sectorial attribution of natural resources induce drastic depletion of natural capital. There is a need for bridging sectoral policies into interdisciplinary sustainable management strategies in the Mediterranean region. The complex interactions between ecosystems, food, energy, and water sectors are calling for an integrated approach for supporting impact assessments and decision-making. We aimed to investigate the coherence among the sectoral policies, either supporting or conflicting with each other, on cross-cutting strategies and their impacts on ecosystem and their services. We address ecosystem services as a fourth component besides energy, water, and food sectors in the nexus approach. We collected expert opinions on eleven sectoral policies that cover different disciplines (water, agriculture, energy, economy, and environment). Based on the opinion of the experts, we developed several multi-criteria analyses (MCA) to assess sectoral policy impacts on cross-sectoral strategic targets. Considerable consistency was found in ranking the eleven policies when considering using nexus or cross-cutting strategies criteria, or when considering positive or negative impacts. The EWFE nexus dimension allowed to better distinguish potential synergies or conflicts between sector policies because it provided a framework in which the role of ecosystem service was more explicit. Interestingly, restoring ecosystem and green infrastructures policy ranks among the top policies in all MCAs but according to the experts its probability of successful implementation is among the lowest. The results show that sustainable use of ecosystem services and conservation of the biodiversity are an indispensable pillar to achieve successfully sectoral development goals.

However, it is not clear whether the FAHP is better than the AHP in terms of quality of the solution. First, the study demonstrates that the FAHP can provide a different solution than the AHP, regardless of which solution is better. However, it is also shown that such a difference does not provide an additional advantage over the AHP when a decision is proposed. Although the FAHP is a well-proven method, this study provides an insight on its practical applicability.

AB  - There has been a remarkable progress in the application of finish hard turning to reduce production, tooling, and maintenance costs, and further to increase the overall efficacy in metal cutting practice. Machining practice under conventional dry condition of hardened work material has been a usual practice in metal machining industries, but it has its drawbacks. In addition, the improved relationship between input and output factors is established considering suitability and potential approach with appropriate selection of working environment for effective utilization in turning practice. Accordingly, MQL working environment has demonstrated to be a superior mechanism owing to its ecological along with cost effective benefits, worker’s safety, enhanced cooling performances and improved performance. MQL assisted hard turning based on vibration signal is the emerging issue in machining practice. Herein, this review paper discusses the machining characteristics based on vibration signal during hard turning that will be helpful for researcher and production engineers in shop floor application under a predefined problem. At last, this review present highlights on analysis of the correlation of input machining parameters and vibration signal on machining features like tool wear, surface roughness and cutting temperature under MQL environment which is still untouched by researchers around the globe.

AB  - The Cloud-of-Things (CoT) paradigm is a challenging approach to manage IoT applications exploiting Cloud resources and services. In order to avoid latency in Cloud–IoT communications, the management of time-sensitive services has to be moved to the edge of the CoT. To this aim, a secure Cloud-to-Edge environment for seamless management of IoT applications is necessary. The realization of a performing and secure Cloud-to-Edge middleware solution is a very strategic goal for future business CoT services. Thus, it needs to be deeply investigated, as highlighted by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA). A valuable approach to develop an efficient Cloud-to-Edge system is based on an instant-message communication solution. In current Cloud environments, a Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) based on an Instant Message Protocol (IMP) provides good performance, but overlook security requirements. In this paper, we aim at overcoming such a gap following the CSA guidelines. In particular, we discuss the involved issues for improving such a kind of Cloud-to-Edge system in order to achieve data confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation. Moreover, we analyze a real case of study considering a MOM architectural model. Experimental results performed on a real testbed show how the introduced secure capabilities do not affect the overall performances of the whole middleware.

AB  - Site selection is one of the most important decision making processes for firms since, if done correctly, it provides access to the best customers and the greatest market potential. In contrast, poor location choices are costly and difficult to reverse. This paper deals with the single branch site selection problem in the banking context. Due to the high level of complexity (several factors have to be taken into consideration in the decision making process as well as a wide range of entities' internal requirements), to date there is no single procedure that fits all needs. This paper attempts to provide a solution to this problem by proposing a unified method based on minimizing the distance from the candidate-branch to the most successful branches, taking into account each banking institution’ notion of branch success. This methodology would work well at the lowest possible cost.

AB  - Organizations have to deal with increasing challenges in their supply chains. Their decision makers brought to balance economic performance with environmental and social issues. Methods and concepts for jointly optimizing economic, environmental and social cost of operations in supply chains are challenging. Decision support systems could help organizations to support sustainability in their supply chains. A collaborative decision-making framework for sustainable supply chain planning is proposed in this paper. This framework facilitates the development of multi-party collaborative relationships across a network to improve the sustainability of delivered products. It supports a new Information and Communication Technology (ICT) system platform. The platform provides insight for infrastructure and visibility to support supply chain sustainability requirements. The proposed decision support system proposes simultaneously collaboration and sustainability functionalities missing in many existing supply chain planning systems. This system has been evaluated and validated through a pilot program across a range of food supply networks. The work is motivated and applied by a major European research program in the agri-food supply chain.

AB  - Earth and its resources are the most important assets of humankind; they are valuable not only for the present generation but also for future communities. Therefore, a mined land area should be closed and reclaimed to protect the environment from probable contaminants. This study develops a new approach by integrating an intelligent multi-goal fuzzy cognitive map and a fuzzy analytical network process to evaluate and prioritize mined land reclamation strategies. The approach is exemplified based on the data of a limestone mine area by examining sustainable development goals, several criteria and related sub-criteria, and important reclamation strategies. Results of the fuzzy cognitive map indicate that the criteria have nearly similar effects on sustainable goals. The prioritization results of the developed approach indicate that the strategy of “mine closure and installation of solar cells” is the most appropriate alternative for reclaiming the studied mine area. An expert team has approved results along with an evaluation of the effective factors and conditions of the area.

AB  - In this paper, a likelihood based evidence acquisition approach is proposed to acquire evidence from experts' assessments as recorded in historical datasets. Then a data-driven evidential reasoning rule based model is introduced to R&D project selection process by combining multiple pieces of evidence with different weights and reliabilities. As a result, the total belief degrees and the overall performance can be generated for ranking and selecting projects. Finally, a case study on the R&D project selection for the National Natural Science Foundation of China is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed model. The data-driven evidential reasoning rule based model for project evaluation and selection (1) utilizes experimental data to represent experts' assessments by using belief distributions over the set of final funding outcomes, and through this historical statistics it helps experts and applicants to understand the funding probability to a given assessment grade, (2) implies the mapping relationships between the evaluation grades and the final funding outcomes by using historical data, and (3) provides a way to make fair decisions by taking experts' reliabilities into account. In the data-driven evidential reasoning rule based model, experts play different roles in accordance with their reliabilities which are determined by their previous review track records, and the selection process is made interpretable and fairer. The newly proposed model reduces the time-consuming panel review work for both managers and experts, and significantly improves the efficiency and quality of project selection process. Although the model is demonstrated for project selection in the NSFC, it can be generalized to other funding agencies or industries.

AB  - The complexity of systems for energy production through renewable energy sources (RESs) is constantly increasing considering the integration of multiple modules, e.g. different RES sources, energy storage in batteries and connection to national grid for energy trade purpose. This significant complexity could represent a threat but also an opportunity if adequately managed. Aim of this paper is to propose two different approaches to manage the hourly electricity flows between the different components of a hybrid energy system (HES) fueled by PV modules and a wind turbine, equipped with a battery storage system (BES) to satisfy the demand of a user load with the opportunity to sell and purchase the electricity to/from the national grid. The first approach is a heuristic algorithm (HA) which defines robust but constant dispatching criteria of the energy flows between the HES components considering just the current value of energy production and demand with the aim of minimizing the electricity purchased by the grid. On the contrary, the second approach is a mixed integer linear programing (MILP) model which defines the optimal value of the energy flows to maximize the net profit of the HES operations determined by the electricity sales revenues minus the energy purchase costs. The developed MILP leverages the short-term forecast of the atmospheric conditions and user demand as well it considers variable energy sale and purchase pricing in the different daily hours. Both these approaches have been tested and validated through a case study of a residential building in which multiple households live located in the suburban area of Munich (Germany). The obtained results highlight how the MILP outperforms HA considering the net profit achievable weekly due to electricity trade with the grid. In particular, the MILP improve the HA economic performance of the HES operation management of 18% on average over the different months of the year.

AB  - Remanufacturing has received extensive attention due to its advantages in material and energy saving, emission reduction and is often considered a viable approach for the realization of a circular economy. Remanufacturing ecological performance reflects the ability of an enterprise to balance economic and environmental benefits. Therefore, evaluating the remanufacturing ecological performance is of great significance for leveraging the benefits of remanufacturing and promoting the concept of sustainability and the implementation of a circular economy in the industry. To this end, a set of data-driven techniques, i.e., data envelopment analysis, R clustering and grey relational analysis, are deployed to analyze and evaluate the ecological performance of a remanufacturing process. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method are illustrated via a case study of remanufacturing for hydraulic cylinder and boom cylinder. Furthermore, a number of critical factors, e.g., energy-saving rate, remanufacturing process cost and rate of remanufacturing, for end-of-life products have been identified as the key drivers impacting the remanufacturing ecological performance. So as to improve remanufacturing ecological performance, optimizing production technology, implementing lean remanufacturing and raising public acceptability over remanufacturing products are effective measures. The research results of the present work can provide support for remanufacturing enterprises to guide and improve their ecological performance and formulate better development strategies.

AB  - Crop production responses to water and soil characteristics is important to understand and manage regional agricultural production. However, the coupling characteristic of these factors was less quantified and it lacks a deep understanding of its effect on the crop production. North China Region (NCR), an important food production region in China but also one of the most water-stressed areas, was selected as the study area. Based on the remote sensing monitoring techniques, region evapotranspiration model, multi-criteria evaluation model, the spatial distribution of winter wheat, actual evapotranspiration (ET), and soil fertility score (SF) was measured in sequence. This study proposed a novel coupling index of water consumption and soil fertility (CWS) to measure the coupling characteristic of ET and SF, and correlated it to the winter wheat yield and area. The results indicated a significant correlation between the CWS and winter wheat production but a non-significant correlation between SF and yield and area. CWS in NCR presented a global pattern of high values in the south but low values in the north, in accordance with that of winter wheat production. Coupling the information of water and soil, the CWS showed a higher correlation to winter wheat yield with the correlation coefficient of 0.588 than solely that of the ET with 0.437. A relative lower correlation of CWS than that of ET implied that ignore of soil fertility but emphasis on the water restrictions would limit the high crop yield and influence the optimal allocation of water and soil resources. Our finding demonstrated the effectiveness of CWS and its higher relation to the winter wheat production in NCR. Information of spatial coupling and mismatching between the winter wheat production and CWS was suggested to be considered as a guide of better spatial optimal allocation of winter wheat.

AB  - With the increasingly serious problems of environmental impact and excessive consumption of production resources brought about by industrial development, enterprises pay more and more attention to the green manufacturing of industry. In the existing green manufacturing standard system, it clearly covers all elements, layers, activities and functions of green manufacturing. However, it does not refine the specific contents of green manufacturing model and framework in different industrial areas. The research in this paper can fill this gap. This paper aims to provide a general model and overall framework of green manufacturing for industrial enterprises. In this way, according to the needs and conditions, enterprises can construct and formulate a clear plan for the implementation of green manufacturing that conforms to their actual situation of enterprises. By these, it can ultimately enhance the improvement ratio of comprehensive green rate for enterprises. In this paper, a general reference model for green manufacturing based on IIPG (Industrial Implementation for Product life cycle based on Green index system) modular is proposed. Then, in the form of a case, three enterprises in three key industrial fields are selected to customize and validate the model. Integrating with intelligence technologies, such as artificial intelligence and industrial cloud, this model can be improved by the higher data processing efficiency and computing speed in green index systems, which is the follow-up work.

AB  - We present an optimal cost and design prediction of an underground gas storage (UGS) system, which is proposed to be constructed from one or more lined rock caverns. The adaptive network based fuzzy inference system ANFISUGS was generated to predict minimal investment costs and optimal UGS design. Since a safe and impermeable UGS system requires a rigorous calculation, three steps were proposed to solve this task: the first is solving the geotechnical engineering problem for different UGS designs, the second is the cost/design optimization of the UGS structures, and the last is the generation of an ANFIS system for optimal cost and design prediction of the UGS. While the geotechnical problem was solved with a series of finite element analyses in order to define special geotechnical constraints to be put into the optimization models, a parameter non-linear programming (NLP) optimization approach was used for a variety of different UGS design parameters. The ANFISUGS system was then constructed on the basis of data sets defined from previous NLP optimization results. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness and the prediction capability of the proposed ANFISUGS system.

AB  - A range of varying criteria with trade-offs need consideration when selecting a suitable renewable energy technology (RET) for a specific area or location. In this study RETs in South Africa, in accordance with the national renewable energy program, were assessed to compare and highlight feasible technology options. A key objective of the study was to develop a framework that could be used to assess the various RETs at utility scale. Important criteria contributing toward the assessment of RETs were identified from literature. The criteria were used within the framework for analysis which consisted of the following factors: technical, economic, environmental, social and political. The goal of assessing RETs in South Africa was located at the top of the framework hierarchy. A total of 15 criteria were identified to use as part of the assessment. A decision-making matrix based on both qualitative and quantitative data was used to score the criteria. The RETs (solar PV, wind, CSP, hydro, biogas and biomass) in South Africa were evaluated with respect to each criterion. The study aims to contribute towards - from a developing country perspective - highlighting key barriers to technology adoption, assist in investment decisions, and ultimately contribute toward a sustainable energy infrastructure. From the analysis performed, solar PV and wind were favoured due to technology maturity and financier perception while CSP also scored favourably due to the potential to meet the baseload energy requirements. The key policy barriers identified that require attention include improved knowledge transfer and better maintenance skills across all technologies while site suitability was identified as a major barrier for hydro and biomass RETs.

AB  - In the Global Maritime Supply Chains (GMSCs), sustainable development and growth of containerized freight (cargo stuffed in maritime containers for transportation) transport system and container port/terminal business have attracted attention of regional governments, financial institutions and regulatory bodies across the globe. Particularly, growing worries about the unpropitious impacts on the environment caused by containerized freight transport industry. The industry has contributed immensely in growth and expansion of global trade and therefore increased trade promises sustainable growth of global port and shipping activities. Competition in liner shipping industry has shrunk profits of the carriers while struggling to grab more market share, which has led them to work upon creating value to the customers in order to gain edge over others. Therefore, this study is conducted from business perspective that how the global container shipping sector can create value to its customers and stakeholders and also go tandem with environmental aspect. The objective of the study is to identify and examine the value creating factors and sub-factors of GMSCs of containerized freight. Data on value creating factors is collected by consulting 57 ports and shipping industry experts globally. We propose FAHP (Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process) framework for evaluating these value creating factors and develop this study which will not just help carriers but also the stakeholders in the containerized freight transport industry to measure their competitive edge over rivals. This study concludes with sensitivity analysis, results and discussions, managerial and practical implications of the conceptual framework.

Steady-state and transient heat numerical analyses are carried out to determine the system's thermal performance, i.e. U-value, time lag and decrement factor, while data from the literature are used to assess its environmental impact in terms of embodied energy and carbon. The results are compared against corresponding data referring to common contemporary construction systems. The overall efficiency of the proposed building solution is further evaluated via a comparative qualitative analysis of various aspects associated with construction practices, in-service use and aesthetic quality. The outcomes obtained indicate that the novel masonry system EcoBrick hereby examined has excellent prospects and can be effectively adopted by the building industry, provided that a higher technological matureness level is attained.

AB  - Efficient management and treatment of municipal waste is essential for achieving green growth. Recent studies have revealed convergence in European Union (EU) member states' performance in municipal waste treatment, particularly since the transposition of the 2008 European Waste Framework Directive into national laws. However, there are still notable differences between countries. In this paper, we calculate a composite indicator of performance in municipal waste treatment at the country-level. We also present an in-depth examination of differences in performance across EU member states. Our results show that the best performers—mainly high income Northern and Central European countries—treat larger quantities of waste per capita, mostly through recycling and composting and digestion. At the opposite end of the ranking, the worst performers—mostly poorer Eastern European countries—treat smaller amounts of waste per capita, largely through landfilling. Our main conclusion is that further policy measures aimed at reducing cross-country differences in waste treatment performance are needed in the EU.

AB  - Background and objective
The rapid growth of computer methods encourages and creates competitive advantages in the medical industry. Nowadays many health centers try to build successful and beneficial relationships with their patients using customer relationship management (CRM) methods, to recognize target patients, attract potential patients, increase patient loyalty and maximize profitability. Customer lifetime value (CLV) is a metric that can help organizations to calculate their customers’ value or group them; therefore in this research we aim to develop a new CLV model for the medical industry that groups patients using computer-based methods.
Methods
To model CLV for the medical industry, we will use two computer-based methods. First, to model patients’ behavior, a data mining approach is required: the K-means algorithm is used to cluster patients and the decision tree technique is used to analyze patient clusters. Next, Markov chain model, a stochastic approach, is utilized to predict future behavior of customers
Results
This paper proposes a new CLV model for the medical industry that has some benefits over other CLV papers. It is patient behavior based, helping us to predict the future behavior of each patient as well as helping to modify managerial strategies for each type of patient. The derived CLV model includes less than 0.08 error rates.
Conclusions
Using the derived CLV model helps health centers to group their patients by computer-based methods, which makes their decision making more accurate and trustworthy. The present research helps organizations within the health industry to group and rank their patients by a new CLV model and fit their strategies to each patient group, based on his/her behavior type.

AB  - Maintaining a high level of thermal comfort and indoor air quality for occupants while minimizing the system energy consumption is crucial for the long-haul High-speed train cabins. The traditional way of handling the multi-objective problem relies on the “trial and error” design which involves lengthy manual design parameter adjustment and performance evaluation based on on-site measurements or analytical and empirical models. To shorten design optimization process, a multi-objective optimization platform has been developed using the nondominated sorting-based particle swarm optimization (NSPSO) algorithm for searching the trade-off optimal design of the ventilation system in a fully occupied high-speed train (HST) cabin. A computational model of the HST cabin occupied by four full rows of passengers was constructed using ANSYS Fluent. To ensure the accuracy of the CFD model, high resolution computational thermal manikins were adopted to simulate the thermal and pollutant dispersion under influence of the passengers. Different combinations of ventilation operation parameters were evaluated against its performance in terms of thermal comfort, air quality and energy consumption. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost of constructing the training sample, a Multi-fidelity Kriging technique is also proposed a surrogate method in replacing the time-consuming CFD simulations while maintaining acceptable accuracy. The result demonstrates that the presented approach is capable to perform a multi-objective optimization for indoor ventilation system design and yield accurate Pareto-front result with up to 35.61% saving of computational time.

AB  - The global economy is significantly dependent on the Oil and Gas (O&G) sector. However, this sector has a considerably negative impact on the environment and society. A Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) system can help towards addressing some of the environmental and social issues in the sector. Recent research on SSCM in the case sector is limited, and determinants that influence the adoption/implementation of the SSCM practices and their influence on the Operational and Business Performance (OPR) have not been deeply analyzed. The present study tries to bridge this research gap by identifying and analyzing the influence of determinants of SSCM on the OPR of the case supply chain in the Indian context. This study has been carried out in two stages; in the first stage, Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) methodology was employed for establishing the mutual relationship between the determinants. Also, the dependency of OPR on the determinants was identified. Later, in the second stage, primary data on determinants of SSCM and their impact on OPR were collected. Then, the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) methodology was employed for analyzing the data. The ISM approach led to the inference that one determinant namely ‘Regulatory Pressure (RP)’ had the highest driving power; on the other hand, results of the SEM methodology showed that one determinant namely ‘Collaborative Green Logistics (Forward & Reverse) (CGLC)’ had a significant influence on the OPR. These results are intended to guide the researchers and environmentalists as well as government policy- and decision-makers, and organizational managers in understanding the various determinants, their interrelationship and influence on the OPR.

AB  - Smart city is originally aimed at dealing with various urban problems due to rapid urbanization, like energy shortage, congestion, and environmental pollution. The Chinese government has been devoting to the promotion of smart cities for many years. However, it is unconfirmed whether the city is more resilient with all the modern technologies provided when unexpected predicaments like climate changes or disasters occur. Therefore, it is urgent to consider resilience in the smart city. This paper provides a MCDM approach to assess and rank the resilience of 187 smart cities in China. The results demonstrate that the overall resilience of smart cities is at a relatively low level. There is also a significant unbalance of resilience between smart cities due to different infrastructural, economic, social, institutional, and environmental conditions. The potential links between urban smartness and resilience were also explored, and the results showed significant positive relationship between the smartness of a city and its resilience. Evidence also proved that developing smartness is more or less useful for improving urban resilience. Suggestions such as strengthening the development of infrastructure and economy, and enhancing the multi-stakeholders’ cooperation are proposed to further promote the smart and resilient development in China.

AB  - The paper considers a new approach to online decision-making in telecommunication systems based on applying hierarchical fuzzy situational networks. This approach allows one to make efficient decisions in the conditions of dynamically changing external factors. Mathematical foundations for creation and application of hierarchical fuzzy situational networks to implement the fuzzy logical inference in telecommunication networks are presented. As a case study for implementation of the offered methods the problem of alternative multipath routing is analyzed. The architecture of the online decision-making system, based on hierarchical fuzzy situational networks and oriented on its multi-agent implementation, is considered. The generalized online decision-making system functioning algorithm is developed. The architecture of an intelligent agent of the online decision-making system is shown. The assessment of efficiency for the approach to construction of online decision-making systems demonstrates its benefits in comparison with the known probabilistic methods of decision-making in telecommunication networks. It also proves a possibility of functioning of the offered online decision-making system in a real or near real mode.

This exploratory study identified locational determinants that are associated with the degree of critical food safety violations in hotel restaurants in the Miami metropolitan area in the United States. The results indicated that proximity to the beach, downtown, city of Miami, and airport had a significant effect on critical food safety violations. Furthermore, considerable local variations in the relationships among variables were explored using a geographically weighted regression. The implications on and suggestions for effective food safety planning and policy related to tourism are discussed.

AB  - The quantity and quality of water resources are of great importance in maintaining urban socio-economic development. Accordingly, substantial research has been conducted on the concept of the water resources carrying capacity (WRCC). In this study, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and system dynamics (SD) models were combined to construct a multi-criteria evaluation system of the WRCC and a socio-economic/water resources SD model for Xi'an. The developmental trends of the society, economy, water supply/demand, and wastewater discharge were obtained from 2015 to 2020 using five scenarios designed for distinct purposes; these scenarios and trends were comprehensively evaluated using a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results indicated that the WRCC (0.32 in 2020) in Xi'an will shift from a normal to a poor state if the current social development pattern is maintained; therefore, we conclude that the socio-economic development of Xi'an is unsustainable. However, under a comprehensive scheme, the WRCC index (0.64 in 2020) will increase by 48% compared with the WRCC index under a business-as-usual scenario. Further, some practical suggestions, including the promotion of industrial reforms and the improvement of water-use efficiency and recycling policies, were provided for improving the regional WRCC.

AB  - Reverse logistics has achieved recognition due to environmental disturbance, government policies, sustainability, globalization, warranty returns, end-of-life components, etc. However, business associations face numerous complexities and difficulties in executing reverse logistics activities due to the presence of several barriers. This research aims to identify and prioritize the solutions for mitigating the impact of barriers to reverse logistics implementation. This study proposes a hybrid framework using Modified Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) to achieve the objective of this research. The relative effect of barriers is evaluated using Modified SWARA, while WASPAS is used to prioritize the solutions of barriers to reverse logistics implementation. The empirical case investigation of an Indian electrical manufacturing industry is conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework. The solution ‘Formulate and enforce strict yet supportive laws, policies for returns and end of life components’ is most prominent for mitigating barriers. This research presents a structured and systematic approach for organizations to mitigate reverse logistics implementation barriers through the proposed solutions. Also, this research lists out few novel barriers and its solutions from the case company prospective. The proposed solutions are effective in solving multiple barriers simultaneously. The research may give significant statute to the decision-makers and domain experts to build up their arrangement of organizational activity for short terms as well as for the long haul for implementing reverse logistics.

Few applications are recognized for supporting social housing plans with spatial information, especially regarding the ability to provide room for new initiatives. The aim of this research is to propose a Social Housing Index (SHI) for integrating and quantifying urban spatial socio-environmental information to support social housing plans. To this end, data about land use and sectoral activities are integrated using a standardizing methodological framework. The SHI supports studies on location alternatives for new housing projects and the availability of infrastructure and services for the implemented housing complexes. The proposed index also harmonizes the development of housing plans by making different demands compatible for supporting urban sustainability.

AB  - Effective safety training is an indispensable means to ensure mine safety. Virtual Reality (VR) technology is a promising method to improve training efficiency. At present, research on VR mine safety training is limited; it focuses mainly on the implementation of a VR training system rather than the evaluation of the techniques and methods employed, which is far more important. The evaluation of a VR safety training system mainly includes the selection of indicators, calculation of weights, and a comprehensive evaluation of the system components. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the VR mine safety training system with the analytic hierarchy process and the fuzzy logic technology. Firstly, by analyzing the components of the VR system, the weights of the system components and the main elements of each part are determined; the most important part is the software, which has a weight of 49.62%. Secondly, the fuzzy logic of each element will give a comprehensive evaluation result of the system. An existing VR training system is evaluated, and the result appears to be moderate. The main disadvantage of the system is the lack of realism, the absence of user data record, and the limited degree of freedom of the VR scene. Through this method, the VR training system can be scientifically and efficiently evaluated, and the system shortcomings can be derived from the evaluation results, so that the system can be improved in future, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the system itself, and laying a solid foundation for safety training.

AB  - The energy output characteristics of mountain wind farms are more complex and unpredictable than that of flat wind farms because of complex mountainous terrain. Some questions about the energy output characteristics of mountain wind farms are still unclear. For example, the effect of local wind resource characteristics on the energy output of mountain wind farms. In another scenario, single-unit data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system are used to investigate the performance of wind turbines in some cases. But, single-unit SCADA data may not be very comprehensive. To fill this gap, multiple-units SCADA data of 2 MW wind turbines are used to comparatively investigate the energy characteristics of wind turbines in a mountain wind farm. The main contribution of this paper is to obtain a new and comprehensive understanding of the actual characteristics of the energy output of mountain wind farms, rather than staying in the design stage or general theoretical analysis. Specifically, the following issues, including (1) influence of wind speed on energy output, (2) influence of wind direction on energy output, (3) relationship between rotor speed and energy output, (4) power coefficient, have been discussed in depth. To overcome the influence of inherent deviation in wind speed measurement and the inertia of the wind rotor, a newly improved algorithm for calculating power coefficient is proposed. Creatively, a fast and operable data dividing method is presented, and the power coefficients of different operating regions are given. Through the investigation, the influence of local wind resource characteristics on the energy output is obtained. It is found that in the same mountain wind farm, the energy output curves of different wind turbines are different. For instance, energy outputs for four wind turbines in December 2015 are 434 MW, 614 MW, 205 MW, 255 MW, respectively.

AB  - Due to the high requirement of skills and human resources, talent management has become an essential strategic domain for the success and survival of both local and multinational organisations in the energy sector. This research intends to identify, and analyse the barriers to Sustainable Human Resource Management with a focus on Talent Management in the Indian oil and gas sector. From the literature review and expert teams' suggestions, several significant barriers were identified, and further their mutual interrelationships were explored using total interpretive structural modelling technique. Later, the matrice d'impacts croisés multiplication appliqués à un classement analysis was used to identify the barriers having high driving intensity. Finally, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory was employed for establishing the cause-effect relationships between the barriers. The results of the integrated structural model highlighted that three barriers namely ‘uncertain career growth’, ‘industry dynamism’, and ‘lack of training programs’ were the significant barriers. This research intends to help the practising managers in understanding the relationship between the barriers and identifying the most critical (driving/causal) ones in linking talent management with sustainable human resource management for higher corporate sustainability of organisations in the oil & gas sector.

AB  - With increasing governmental pressures to reduce energy consumption, manufacturing companies are faced with the challenge of reducing energy consumption whilst maintaining or increasing profits and productivity. Computational modelling is a powerful tool for energy analysis within the manufacturing industry as an effective decision making technique in order to optimise throughput, effectively plan and manage operations, reduce bottlenecks and test various scenarios. This study reviewed methodologies and frameworks developed for analysing energy consumption on a machine process level. Multi-level holistic analysis allowing for consideration of individual machines, the manufacturing process chain and built environment, with both discrete event and continuous based simulation are also presented. The requirement of a complete, high accuracy computational model is highlighted in order to understand the interaction between all relevant material, energy and resource flows. Challenges associated with achieving a holistic simulation of the manufacturing facility with all relevant parameters is presented, along with areas for further development. Furthermore, the development of Industry 4.0 is reviewed, along with new and emerging technologies allowing for increased automation, connectivity and flexibility within manufacturing, as well as visual techniques to provide further understanding and clarity of manufacturing processes such as digital twins, virtual and augmented reality.

AB  - New technologies can yield high market potential, but also challenge engineering capabilities. For example, additive manufacturing enables unlimited freedom of design and economical production of small batch sizes. However, there are huge challenges: A large variety of new additive technologies, limited choice of materials and mostly high production cost as result of long production time. Since today’s production requires an economical implementation, focus needs to be on hybrid production, which combines the advantages of additive and conventional manufacturing technologies. This requires an integrated optimization of the product design, the manufacturing technology chain and the operative equipment. The following paper presents an approach for this integrated planning approach with the aim of economically feasible hybrid production. In general, the interdependencies between product and manufacturing technology need to be used for optimization in early stages of the product life cycle. To achieve a high customer value, the product requirements have to be analyzed in detail to find an optimal product function, but also to identify degrees of design freedom, which do not influence product function and, thus, can be adapted to optimize production. Moreover, possible changes in the capabilities of manufacturing technologies and, subsequently, operative equipment and machines can be anticipated to further enhance the production. After identifying optimal combinations of product design and manufacturing technology chains, the selection and optimal configuration of the operative equipment is necessary and needs to be validate based on the final product design. The integration of product design, manufacturing technology optimization and operative process planning enables companies to identify and realize high economic potential early in their value creation process and thus can contribute to improving competitiveness.

AB  - Business process management (BPM) has emerged as a prominent information management approach focusing on the design, execution and governance of organizational business processes. The ability to deal with both foreseen and unforeseen changes in business processes is considered critical for contemporary business process management systems. This paper proposes an approach that couples an event-driven framework for detecting and reasoning in situations that pose the need for process adaptations with MCDM methods for selecting adaptations. The proposed approach has been implemented in an aspect-oriented extension of a BPMN2.0 engine in order to enact adaptations of business processes in real-time.

AB  - Understanding and planning for climate change is a complex systems problem that is interdisciplinary and requires place-based and impact-specific management practices for communities to become resilient to a changing environment. The greater Charleston Harbor region is highly susceptible to the projected impacts of climate change due to low lying geography, a strongly bimodal socioeconomic spectrum, and invaluable coastal ecosystem services. Using Charleston as an example community, this paper discusses a selection of increasingly holistic approaches used in developing a system-level, community-focused assessment for vulnerability, risk, and resilience that aim to enable community involvement in the assessment of and planning for climate change-induced severe weather events, more extreme temperatures, and sea level rise.

AB  - This paper describes the application of Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchical Process-Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FAHP-TOPSIS) for the selection of optimum blend from the various alternative blends of fish oil and diesel. A single cylinder, constant speed and direct injection diesel engine with a rated output of 4.4 kW is used for exploratory analysis at different load conditions. Ten parameterssuch as maximization of brake thermal efficiency, rate of pressure rise and minimization of NOx,CO2, CO, HC, smoke, exhaust gas temperature, ignition delay and combustion delay are considered. From the experimental data, multi input multi output (MIMO) fuzzy models are developed using triangular membership functionto predict the engine parameters. The developed model has good correlation with the observed data with noticeably low errors. Then, for each parameter, optimum blend has to be identified for all the loads using genetic algorithm which is a multi-objective optimization process. The engine performance is accurately predicted for the identified best load and blend from the developed fuzzy model. Hence in the proposed model, fuzzy logic is integrated with GAto find the best blend. Finally, from the best blend of each parameter, the exact biodiesel proportion of about 17% for no load, 17% for 25% load, 18% for 50% load, 17% for 75% load and 20% for 100% load are found out usingTOPSIS which will best suit the engine performance and reduction of emissions.

AB  - The on-going offshore outsourcing processes have resulted in complex, global and more vulnerable supply chain to disruptions. However, a good supplier choice would preserve or even improve supply chain resilience. Despite this critical potential effect, this topic remains relatively underdeveloped in the literature. Accordingly, this study proposes a coupled method based on Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The final model shows the impact of locational decision in offshore outsourcing process on supply chain resilience. Moreover, it allows simulating locations scenarios over time through an inference process. The simulations foresee the impacts of three alternative locations on capabilities required in a resilient supply chain. The sensitivity analysis of the findings reveals that one location would improve supply chain resilience meanwhile the others would damage it. This FCM-AHP analysis enhances the understanding of academics and practitioners about the importance of locations criteria and their influence in the supply chain resilience capabilities.

New developments in information and communication technologies enhance city planners' capacities to elaborate and implement plans to transform a traditional metropolis into a smart city. These plans can enhance the resilience of the city once city administrators and their constituents adopt disaster risk reduction concepts and applications in their city plans to assure the resilience of a city. The chapter reviews the stages of risk assessment and management and then reviews literature that dealt with environmental problems and smart cities to argue that a smart city is capable of being resilient, and thus sustainable.

AB  - With the increase in data traffic, high energy consumption of cooling systems in data centers are rising continually and rapidly. Thus planning energy is more and more important to minimize resources consuming. The equipment in data room can produce vast amount of heat which must be removed, and waste heat recovery is an effective means of saving energy. In this paper, a simulation of the annual dynamic air conditioning load of buildings was conducted through Designer's Simulation Toolkit (DeST) to get the cooling and heat load index, and a data center in Harbin was taken as a case study to evaluate the energy-saving effect. The results indicated that the annual cumulative cooling load was far greater than the annual cumulative heat load, so it has great potential for heat recovery. Then a system that made use of waste heat from data rooms to serve subsidiary buildings was proposed. It could fully satisfy the heat demand in data centers when equipment in data rooms all run. Meanwhile, the heat recovery system has a better economic viability when compare with the air source heat pump system. Therefore, using the heat recovery system can improve the energy efficiency and realize the energy saving.

AB  - Sustainable consumption and production is identified as one of the essential requirements for sustainable development. Due to different economic conditions and socio-cultural factors, sustainable consumption and production requires a diverse focus in developing and developed economies. To date, few efforts have been made to systematically compare the status of sustainable consumption and production and its direction from the perspective of developing and developed economies. This paper provides a literature review of published articles in international scientific journals related to sustainable consumption and production between 1998 and 2018 inclusive. Three carefully designed questions are proposed and answered in this article, forming the basis for conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of the differences and challenges in sustainable consumption and production practices within developed and developing economies. The findings strongly suggest that countries in Europe hold international leadership in sustainable consumption and production practices. This finding, alongside others, is analyzed and discussed in greater detail in this paper, resulting in the articulation of gaps and future research opportunities in the current body of the literature.

AB  - Cleaner production is a simple defensive mechanism to protect the environment from pollution and depletion of resources. It is also envisioned to minimise the waste and capitalise on natural resources with effective utilization. Solar energy is a natural resource which can be converted into electricity using photovoltaic (PV) system. This article sheds insights on the implementation of solar PV system with interdisciplinary views and analyse motives and barriers for PV adoption by different citizen groups in India. A survey was conducted to understand the people's perception on solar PV energy system and to determine the level of acceptability among the citizens. The survey information was synthesised and consolidated from various perspectives and the result consigns the research findings into technical, human and socio-economic components. The findings were synthesised through cross-cultural, comparative and mixed-method research outcomes by means of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), Dendrogram diagram and biplot interpretation. Statistical tools such as ‘IBM-SPSS Amos’ and ‘R’ language programming were also used to interpret the results. This article concludes by specifying the barriers that limit the retrofitting interventions, suggests possible measures and policies to overcome such barriers and promote solar energy in India.

AB  - Mexican oregano is a non-timber forest product harvested in natural vegetation and represents an important source of income for rural families. Recent reports have highlighted decreases in natural populations caused by increased harvest intensity. Oregano leaf harvesting is a complex problem, involving different components and views, and has a clear spatial dimension. We proposed an analytical framework based on multi-criteria-multi-objective analyses. GIS tools were used as the platform for managing, displaying and analyzing ecological and socioeconomic information from different sources in order to evaluate land suitability of three different management strategies for two competing land objectives: oregano Harvest and oregano Regeneration. The incorporation of environmental evaluation criteria in the analysis allowed the identification of new potential oregano harvesting areas which were neither reported by harvesters, nor registered during harvesting trips. Socio-economic criteria, such as land tenure, highlighted the fact that a substantial proportion of current oregano harvesting areas are located outside ejido limits resulting in potential conflicts for resource access. The proposed Balanced oregano management strategy, in which the same proportion of suitable area (50%) was assigned to both objectives, represents the most favorable management strategy. This option allows harvesters to continue earning an income from oregano leaf harvest; and at the same time helps in the selection of the best areas for oregano regeneration. It also represents a management strategy with a smaller impact on oregano populations and on the harvesters´ income, as well as lower monitoring costs. The proposed analytical framework may contribute to advance the application of systematic approaches for solving decision-making problems in areas where oregano leaves and other NTFP are harvested.

The volume and breadth of publications in this area makes it difficult to understand the knowledge structure of the field and the academic work that has influenced the evolution of the domain. This mixed-method study systematically reviews 246 papers that investigated supplier selection issues and were published between 1991 and 2017. We initially examined the statistics of papers by unveiling influential journals, affiliations and articles. Second, we utilized co-citation network analysis, an objective procedure to extract clusters of what has been researched in supplier selection literature. The study analytically retrieves six major knowledge clusters: 1) conceptual foundation of the field; 2) modeling of the procurement environment; 3) handling group-decision making and unprecise input data; 4) computational research; 5) green/sustainable research and 6) risk-based supplier selection. Finally, we conducted main path analysis to get an overview of the evolution of knowledge in the supplier selection field by uncovering its major paths and key articles.

AB  - Land degradation occurs in all kinds of landscapes over the world, but the drivers of land degradation vary from region to region. Identifying these drivers at the appropriate spatial scale is an essential prerequisite for developing and implementing appropriate area-specific policies. In this study, we investigate nine different driving factors in three categories: human disturbance, water condition, and urbanisation. Using partial order theory and the Hasse diagram technique, we analyse the temporal and spatial dynamics of these drivers and identify the major drivers of land degradation at the county level in the Xilingol League, China. Our findings indicate that: (i) in eight out of the region’s 12 counties, human disturbance was the dominant driver responsible for land degradation up to 2000, followed by water conditions, while urbanisation was the dominant driver in only four counties; (ii) the effects resulting from human disturbance and water availability decreased after 2000, while urbanisation became the dominant driver for land degradation in seven counties. The influence of human disturbance in this region has decreased, which suggests that ecological protection policies that were designed to control population and livestock numbers have worked as intended for this region. However, land degradation has continued and new policy measures are required to ease the effect of urbanisation.

The study presents the application on a case study “Qattara Depression”- a 20,000 Km2 development project which has received a lot of attention; on one hand, for its expected benefits to achieve Egypt 2030 national plan in terms of clean electricity generation, while, on the other hand, some concerns have been raised regarding its environmental consequences. The study centers on the project's desalination development scenario considering five main environmental impacts; loss of biodiversity and threats to natural habitat, hydrogeological environmental impact, land use effect and terrestrial impact, impacts on marine life as well as natural hazards and casualties. The study uses the GIS overlaying and querying tools to determine and categorize the problematic areas into major, moderate and minor impact areas, in addition to providing recommendations for addressing their associated challenges. As a preliminary step, the study defines the limits of the area of interest (AOI) in terms of its proximity to the Mediterranean Sea and the River Nile. Each impact is represented with feature datasets including a number of feature classes. Then, the buffering impact area of each individual feature class is defined and overlaid to determine the extent of impacts for the proposed scenario. It is found that the critical sensitive areas are located in the northeastern tip and the western part of the AOI. This indicates that these areas should receive careful attention while planning for any kind of development activities. The results contribute towards setting a comprehensive clue to support the strategic planning objectives and mitigation measures for this huge development project in the Western Desert area.

AB  - Extracting hidden communities from bipartite networks witnessed a determined effort. In this respect, different streams of research relied on bipartite networks to unveil communities. In this paper, we introduce a new approach, called Bi-Comdet, that aims to an efficient community detection in bipartite networks. The main trust of the introduced approach is that it stresses on the importance of grouping two types of nodes in communities having a full connection between its nodes. The quality of the unveiled communities, is assessed through some metrics borrowed from the FCA community, to wit modularity, overlapping and stability. These metrics are then aggregated through the use of multi-criteria method to elect the most pertinent bi-comunity from some candidates. Carried out experiments show that Bi-ComDet sharply outperforms its competitors in terms of modularity, Conductance and intra/inter density.

AB  - For all the evolutionary ages of mineral resource development, there have not been concerns about sustainable mining until the 21st century. Thus, this paper explores the extent to which emerging geospatial technologies have been deliberately used in the mining industry activities to achieve the United Nations Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Governments, the mining industry, Non-Governmental and International Organisations have various investments in geospatial programmes and technologies for Environmental and Social Impact Assessments and baseline studies to enhance the achievement of these goals. However, these efforts prove inadequate to link the social, environmental and economic baseline analysis of sustainable development goals. The observations in this paper, therefore, have been obtained largely from extensive literature review to gain a broad understanding of previous and current applications of emerging technologies in the field. The literature has been explored in two successive steps. First, the literature was broadly queried to find the most current works on sustainable mining for three decades (i.e. 1990 to 2019). Second, out of over 100 papers, reports, and books retrieved in the first step, a more specific search and analysis of existing academic and industry literature on the explicit applications of emerging geospatial technology for enhancing sustainable development in the mining sector was conducted. In spite of its ensemble of capabilities for multivariate analysis, analysis of the literature reveals that there is inadequate adaptation of emerging geospatial technologies, which can simultaneously measure and link generally acceptable social, economic and environmental costs and benefits of mining for sustainability considerations in a local setting. There is a dearth of literature that discuss this new approach in addressing sustainable mining. Findings of this paper shall, therefore, inform the scientific community, industry, Non-Governmental Organisations and consultants on emerging approaches to address salient issues of sustainable mining towards meeting the agenda 2030 SDGs.

AB  - Safety instruction, as a critical part of safety management, plays an important role on construction sites. Unified safety training and irregular inspection are the main safety instructions methods. Considering the complex construction site and low management density, safety instructions received by workers are usually not timely and precise. To improve this situation, this paper established a real-time personalized safety instruction method which considers the different characteristics of workers and complex construction environment. A user-oriented PSIM system is developed in this paper based on GPS and cloud computing. This system could facilitate the collection of the main hazards, safety instructions to these hazards, and project information using questionnaire investigation and paper document. The collected information is classified by 5W1H method and transferred to particular workers according to their different characters, including locations, duties and working time. A case study is presented, which highlight its method for recording data, processing data, and sending personalized safety instruction, in a high-speed railway project. The results demonstrate that important construction information related to both safety and activity in field operations can be automatically processed and visualized in real-time, thus offering benefits to reducing hazards, improving safety awareness of workers, and creating a safer environment for workers effectively at a reasonable cost.

AB  - The issue addressed in this exposition is the classification of multivariate data collected through different sensors for water quality monitoring. Multivariate data are sequences that have various attributes in every instance of the sequences. A few endeavours exist to address this issue; however, none of them has given full emphasis on continuous dataset. Another solution for this issue is to reduce the instances to a single attribute while losing significant information. Different arrangements address both the multivariate and the sequential part of the data yet give an un-versatile solution. The proposed algorithm is not only able to monitor continuous water quality, but it also produces a better classification model for other continuous datasets as well. Instead of decreasing the attributes of the dataset, we introduce three additional reference indicators which are dependent on the actual attributes. We compare the classification accuracy of our proposed algorithm with standard classification models. The proposed method gives better classification accuracy compared to existing methods.

AB  - This study analyzes the effect of multi-attribute decision making (MADM) on the efficiency of the end-of-life vehicle (ELV) reverse logistics industry in the context of the circular economy to improve resource utilization efficiency. In this paper, the DEA-TOPSIS method, based on a prediction model of Triple Exponential Smoothing (TES), is adopted for multi-attribute decision making with a view to improving industry efficiency, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to calculate the input and output indicators' efficiency values and the slack movements of the indicators of input and output decision-making unit's (DMU's) base with TES as the decision-making basis. Meanwhile, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS) is used to rank alternative decision-making schemes. Moreover, the ordering is also carried out using the Additive Weighting, Weighted Product and Elimination et Choice Translating Reality (ELECTRE) method. In this study, the DEA-TOPSIS method is used to make multi-attribute decisions about industry efficiency. Taking Shanghai's ELV industry as an example, this study utilizes 2017 data from seven member-enterprises of the Shanghai End-of-life Vehicle Professional Committee; it uses the DEA-TOPSIS method based on TES to conduct an empirical study on multi-attribute decision making to improve efficiency and analyze efficiency improvement through alternative decision-making schemes. The findings show that the DEA-TOPSIS method based on TES is effective for multi-attribute decision-making to improve the ELV reverse logistics industry's efficiency. The multi-attribute decision-making in this paper facilitates the management and investment decision making of the ELV recycling industry. It also provides an effective solution for managers and researchers in the ELV industry to improve its efficiency.

AB  - Oil and gas sector plays a major role in a country's economy. The development of large transmission pipelines for onshore and offshore gas transport is executed rapidly. These pipelines are vulnerable to natural disasters and can have a serious impact on the environment. The Potential damage to the pipeline infrastructure may contribute to increased risk of spill and thus can have an impact on the environment. Hence, the structural integrity of these pipelines is of great interest to the oil and gas companies, governments, and various stakeholders due to the probable environmental, infrastructural and financial losses in case of a structural failure. Fault tree analysis is an important risk assessment technique which treats the failure probabilities of the components as exact values for estimating the probability of the occurrence of a top event. Due to the lack of historical data for calculating the failure rate of pipelines due to natural hazards, this study aims to analyze the probability of pipeline failure by Fuzzy Fault Tree Analysis (FFTA) with expert elicitation. Fussel-Vesely Importance measures were utilized to rank the cutsets. The proposed FFTA framework was used to analyze the occurrence of top event even in the absence of historical probability data. The results are expected to be helpful to the safety professionals while making decisions related to the risk management of oil and gas pipelines.

AB  - Mental workload (MWL) is a major consideration for the user interface design in nuclear power plants (NPPs). However, each MWL evaluation method has its advantages and limitations, thus the evaluation and control methods based on multi-index methods are needed. In this study, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) theory was adopted for assessment of interface designs in NPP based on operators' MWL. An evaluation index system and membership functions were established, and the weights were given using the combination of the variation coefficient and the entropy method. The results showed that multi-index methods such as performance measures (speed of task and error rate), subjective rating (NASA-TLX) and physiological measure (eye response) can be successfully integrated in FCE for user interface design assessment. The FCE method has a correlation coefficient compared with most of the original evaluation indices. Thus, this method might be applied for developing the tool to quickly and accurately assess the different display interfaces when considering the aspect of the operators' MWL.

KW  - Hybrid approach
KW  - Randomness and fuzziness
AB  - Landslides, which could cause huge losses of lives or property damages, result from several different environmental factors whose influences on landslides are very complex. Therefore, it is essential to understand the relationships between these environmental factors and landslides. Thus, the integration of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) with the normalized frequency ratio (NFR) is evaluated for landslide susceptibility analyses. However, in addition to these complex relationships, the randomness and fuzziness always affect landslide susceptibility mapping. This study introduces the cloud model (CM) to improve the integrated AHP-NFR method, and proposes a novel hybrid AHP-NFR-CM method for landslide susceptibility analyses, which can better address issues of the randomness and fuzziness. Firstly, ten environmental parameters are selected as landslide impact factors, and their values for all the landslides identified in the study area are obtained through the remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) technologies. The AHP method is used to obtain the weight of each landslide impact factor, and the NFR method is used to obtain the weight of each subclass in each landslide impact factor, which can reflect the relationship between the landslide impact factor and landslide occurrence. After applying an appropriate compositional operation between the weights of the landslide impact factors and the weights of the subclasses of the impact factors, a landslide susceptibility index (LSI) for each grid divided via the attribution-based spatial information multi-grid method (ASIMG) can be computed. To solve the inevitable issues of randomness and fuzziness in landslide susceptibility analyses, a cloud model that uses three numerical features (expectation, entropy and hyper-entropy) to represent the intension of the concept, is adopted to improve the methods of AHP and NFR. The relative importance of two landslide impact factors is scaled with the cloud model rather than the Saaty criteria. Pair-wise comparison matrixes of landslide impact factors given by each expert are described by the normal cloud model, and the floating cloud model is used to aggregate all experts' judgments. The weight of each landslide impact factor is also expressed with the cloud model rather than a certain value. In improving the NFR, the weight of each subclass of each landslide impact factor is expressed with the cloud model rather than a certain value. In the improvement of the landslide susceptibility results, the domain of landslide risk assessment results is also displayed with the cloud model instead of a series of definite intervals. As the study area examined is large, several grids would need to be divided, meaning that it would take a considerable amount time to subject the entire study area to landslide susceptibility mapping. Thus, we propose a new attribute-based spatial information multi-grid (ASIMG) division method and introduce grid-computing technology to improve the calculation efficiency during the process. Finally, the proposed hybrid AHP-NFR-CM-ASIMG approach is validated and applied in the study area. It's concluded that the new integration of AHP and NFR methods with the cloud model can consider both randomness and fuzziness and therefore can increase the robustness of landslide susceptibility analyses, while the ASIMG technology can enhance the calculation efficiency in regional landslide susceptibility mapping.

AB  - It is a challenge problem how to deal with the uncertainty in fault diagnosis of power systems. To solve the challenge problem, this paper introduces an interval-valued fuzzy spiking neural P system (IVFSNP system), where the interval-valued fuzzy logic is integrated into spiking neural P systems to characterize the uncertainty. Based on the IVFSNP system, a fuzzy reasoning algorithm is presented, and the corresponding fault diagnosis model is developed. IVFSNP system is capable of describing the incomplete and uncertain fault signals from a supervisory control and data acquisition system equipped together with electric power systems. In order to evaluate the availability and effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis model, two case studies of fault diagnosis of a transmission network are discussed and analyzed, including complex and multiple fault situations with the incomplete and uncertain status signals. The results of the case studies demonstrate that IVFSNP system can be used to diagnose the faulty sections in power transmission networks accurately and effectively.

However, the projects are bound to face a series of risk factors as the industry is in its infancy. This paper conducts a risk assessment on offshore photovoltaic power generation projects in China based on a fuzzy framework. Firstly, 16 risk factors affecting offshore photovoltaic power generation projects in China are identified and classified into 4 groups. Secondly, a risk assessment model is constructed involving Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets, Triangular Fuzzy Number and Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation. Thirdly, this paper conduct an empirical study of China, and the result shows that the risk level of offshore photovoltaic power generation projects in China is medium high. Finally, some response measures are proposed. The risk index system and corresponding countermeasures can provide a reference for project managers to allocate resources to prevent risk events. Besides, the risk assessment model can help project investors to avoid too risky projects. In addition, the risk assessment on offshore photovoltaic power generation projects in China has not been discussed by scholars yet. Thus, this paper contributes to the literature and expand the knowledge.

AB  - Gigantic progressions in heterogeneous communication technologies have empowered smart cities (SCs) to communicate with each other, while ensuring network connectivity. These innovations cannot give impeccable network availability in SCs, because of the coexistence of thousands of gadgets, which realize some issues. In this paper, to resolve the issue of ubiquitous communication provisioning, the MADM techniques are employed for network selection in proposed scenarios under phase 1. Data rate, transmission power, latency, cost, reliability, coverage range, channel bandwidth and security attributes of diverse available networks are utilized for optimal network selection. Cohesive AHP-Entropy weights of respective attributes are derived from subjective weights generated by AHP and objective weights calculated by Entropy. Cohesive weights are employed by TOPSIS algorithm for ranking of the networks available in the vicinity of level 1, 2 and 3 of the communication networks hierarchy. The network with the highest preference level has been selected for communication. The implementation of proposed criterion showed that 3G (HSDPA), WLAN (802.11p), Bluetooth (802.15.1), WiMAX (802.16), Wi-Fi haLow (802.11 ah), 4G have the highest preference level in proposed scenarios UPN, HN, HAN, CR, NAN/MAN and WAN environments respectively. The continuous monitoring of the connected networks and time-to-time selection of optimal networks is required for provisioning of ubiquitous communication in diverse applications (e.g. smart buildings and infrastructure services, smart traffic and transportation system, smart metering of electricity, water, gas and emergency calling services) of SCs. In phase 2, we propose a novel framework for data acquisition and provisioning of ubiquitous communication network in SCs. According to the suitability of applications, the data is acquired by proposed diverse acquisition techniques. Computing at diverse levels 1, 2 and 3 is described in phase 3 for provisioning of offloading, reducing delay and complexity. The overall framework resulted in real-time system scenario for smart cities in forthcoming days.

AB  - In recent years, achieving sustainability in renewable energy systems has become important for achieving future economic prosperity and energy security all over the world; therefore, multiple attempts have been made to assess their sustainability. This means that in addition to considering the technological and economic factors, environmental and social aspects should also be considered. However, the wide-ranging concept of sustainability and the various methodological frameworks presented make their interpretation and correct implementation difficult. In this research, through a systematic literature review, we summarize and analyze the current research on the sustainability assessment of bioenergy production/use (also referred as gaseous biofuels) for electricity and heat generation. Sustainability approaches and their underlying factors from the three dimensions of sustainability were consolidated and structured in this systematic review. In addition, a set of indicators (environmental, social and economic) is provided based on the literature analyzed that decision makers can use to evaluate the sustainability performance of bioenergy systems. The main finding indicates that although there are various international efforts on measuring sustainability, only 32 of studies of the 8542 works initially screened (less than 1%) have an integrated approach that considers all three aspects of sustainability, i.e., environmental, economic and social aspects. In most cases, the focus is on one of the three aspects. Additionally, 50% of the studies evaluated included another dimension, i.e., a cultural, institutional or technical dimension. These results support the idea that a multidimensional sustainability assessment is feasible and facilitates decision-making processes towards a sustainable energy future.

AB  - Multimodal freight terminal (MFT) build a link to connect multiple modes of transport and provide a smooth flow of freight in the supply chain network. The sustainability measure of MFT can be viewed as a lever to uplift freight transportation sustainability. The MFT sustainability assessment involves several subjective criteria, incomplete criteria information, and vagueness in the group decision-making process. To keep above nature of the decision-making problem, this paper use intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) based MCDM framework for sustainability assessment. The IF method is suitable for incorporating experts importance degree in decision-making problem. The proposed sustainability framework includes social, technical, economic, environmental, and political (STEEP) sustainability dimension for assessment of MFT location. The framework considers twenty-five sub-criteria, including four new criteria for location assessment. The importance of STEEP criterion is computed by employing IF-analytic hierarchy process (IF-AHP). The proposed framework is validated with a case of Eastern dedicated freight corridor (EDFC) of India. The sustainability assessment of four alternative locations is measured by employing an IF based TOPSIS method. The computation result of the considered case shows that technical sustainability is the most important criteria for location selection, followed by economic criteria. The experts' varying importance based sensitivity analysis is the novelty of this paper. The sensitivity analysis depicts the robustness of the proposed framework. The managerial and theoretical implications of the study are presented. The resulting analysis helps transport policymakers in investment assessment for freight terminal.

AB  - Trees are an important component of our ecosystem and play a crucial role in maintaining environmental quality. They are also essential for maintaining the aesthetic beauty of a landscape. Typically, in case of road broadening, large number of trees are purged. Thus proper monitoring, planning and maintenance of health and growth rate of the trees are required in order to save them. Mobile laser scanning facilitates the mapping of road side objects at a high speed. In this research, an automated method for street trees detection, thinning the interior points of detected trees and calculation of morphological parameters using Mobile Laser Scanner (MLS) data is proposed. The method has been divided into three phases. The first phase detects the street trees from input MLS point cloud data while the second phase deals with the findings of exterior points of detected trees by using the three-dimensional slicing. In the last phase, morphological parameters are calculated for each tree. Proposed method is tested at a MLS data. Completeness and correctness of the method for detection of street trees are 97.85% and 96.80%, respectively.

AB  - Optimized design and performance of an off-grid solar PV/Fuel Cell/Diesel Generator power system for University building is presented in this study. The main objective is to design a power system with high renewable fraction; low greenhouse gas emissions, and low cost of energy. The goal is to switch from grid-tied fossil fuel power system to a renewable and cleaner power system. Hourly calculations were performed to test the power system performance and cost using optimization and control methodologies. The simulation and performance analysis showed that the proposed renewable energy system offers the best results: 73% of the total energy from the solar PV, 24% from the fuel cell and 3% from the Diesel generator. All the electrical load of the building is met without power shortage (<0.1%). The proposed stand-alone hybrid renewable power system has high renewable fraction (66.1%), is economically feasible (92 $/MWh) and environmentally friendly (24 kg CO2/MWh).

AB  - Environmental assessments require the development and analysis of a large amount of data. Decision-makers must manage considerable amounts of information just to obtain a viable set of alternatives. The environmental assessment proposed in this study is a decision-support framework that facilitates obtaining results that endorse the decision-making process. This study aims to provide a fast and straightforward analysis of the influence of energy consumption in water treatment systems (energy-for-water) and its impact onto the environment, considering water quality requirements, water distribution systems, and how different energy combination setups affect these variables. The framework was applied to countries on the seashore experiencing water scarcity distress and world average greenhouse gas emissions regimes as examples, but it can also be applied to other types of systems. Energy-for-water greenhouse gas emissions can be decreased through the awareness-related measures reflected in the selection of energy sources, changing water desalination process, optimizing water intake, choosing water reuse, and using untreated seawater in industrial processes. Countries with the highest greenhouse gas emissions continue obtaining electricity from coal. Likewise, greenhouse gas emissions are lower in countries using nuclear energy as a source of electricity. However, the reliance on nuclear energy often depends on stakeholder approval.

AB  - In the context of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT), machine-tools producers are adopting servitization as a way to develop and sell new specialized data-oriented services already imbedded in their machines, providing analytics. However, large companies producing automation services and products offer generic turnkey IoT-based solutions, which can be implemented in any type of machinery to extract data and provide analytics. These generic solutions can be an important threat to the specialized ones, mainly those developed by SME manufacturers. In this context, this paper aims to investigate to what extent specialized solutions can be compared to generic solutions regarding perceived value. We performed an exploratory study employing a case-based method combined with TOPSIS, in which known generic solutions are compared to one specialized solution provided by a machine-tools producer SME. From the academic point of view, our results provide a better understanding of the requirements of an IoT-based analytics solution in the field. In addition, we propose an approach that can be used by other researchers for value-added analysis of companies embarking on a servitization process. Practical contributions include a method allowing manufacturer to make an informed decision about the solution to be selected for their factories. Moreover, machine-tool manufacturers and service providers will be able to better identify and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. This project was performed in the context of a living lab for Industry 4.0 and its results are being employed to create a learning factory for research, development, education and training purposes.

AB  - A sustainable lifestyle is the inevitable choice for mitigating global climate change. This paper describes a multi-agent simulation to analyze the impact of preferences, income parameters, and interaction intensity on residents’ decision-making about sustainable lifestyles considering social interaction. The results showed that preferences made a difference to residents’ choice and that residents with interest preferences are most susceptible to interactive information. Greater benefits can induce residents to practice a sustainable lifestyle, whereas cost and benefits loss determine the macro trend of group decision-making. In addition, it was found that large nodes (residents with more neighbors) play a key role in guiding residents to implement a sustainable lifestyle. These results improve our understanding of the impact of social interaction on individual decisions to practice a sustainable lifestyle. These findings could facilitate the practical implementation of sustainable lifestyles and provide new ways to launch policies related to sustainable lifestyle promotion.

AB  - The aviation sector is currently responsible for 2.6% of global carbon emissions. Carbon emissions of the aviation sector are expected to increase by 3–4% each year due to the rising demand for air travel. The use of bio-jet fuel derived from carinata (Brassica carinata) is a potential solution for mitigating carbon emissions from the aviation sector. This study determines suitable sites for growing carinata across three southeastern states of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. Suitable edaphic (average soil storage, soil organic carbon, root zone depth) and climatic variables (temperature) along with historical land use trajectories were used for determining the land suitability for carinata production. The weights of the edaphic variables were decided by surveying experts using the Analytical Hierarchy Process. This study also determined the susceptibility of frost events in growing season of carinata from 2010 to 2017. Finally, the composite risk was calculated by multiplying the probability of potential damage risk and probability of land risk. Considering minimum risk level of 5%, about 45.56% (0.77 million ha) of land in Georgia, 0.81% (0.01 million ha) land in Alabama and about 3.04% (0.05 million ha) of land in Florida is suitable for growing carinata. Depending upon the composite risk level and expected carinata yields, the total production potential of carinata was between 1.87 and 3.91 million metric tons which was sufficient for producing between 980 and 2045 million liters of bio-jet fuel sufficient enough to replace 1.4%–2.33% of the current jet fuel consumption in the United States. Our study will feed into current policy debate about reducing carbon footprint of the aviation sector in the United States and promote development of bio-economy for rural America.

AB  - Microemulsions (MEs) are stable, isotropically clear solutions consisting of an oil and water stabilized by a surfactant and a co-surfactant. Oil-in-water microemuslion liquid chromatography (MELC) is a relatively new chromatographic mode, which uses an O/W ME as mobile phase. Retention, selectivity and efficiency can be modified by changing the concentration of the ME components and the ratio between the aqueous and oil phases. This work makes a critical survey on the information found in the literature about the mobile phase compositions that lead to the creation of successful O/W ME mobile phases, as well as the effect of pH for ionizable compounds and temperature. The viability of performing the analyses using isocratic and gradient elution is also considered. The complexity of the composition of a successful ME, and the fact that the different factors interact each other, may require many manipulations during method development to achieve an acceptable separation for complex mixtures. This is the reason of the proposal from several authors of a standard ME as starting point when developing a method for a new separation with no previous reports. Based on these initial conditions, the interest of several authors in applying computer-assisted approaches to optimize the composition of ME mobile phases, and reduce significantly the time and reagent consumption for method development, is described. Some practical tips are given to prepare stable ME mobile phases that yield reproducible results.

AB  - The contradiction between urban growth and environmental sustainability is a fundamental question regarding the welfare of human beings and the future of the earth. Human labor transforms the earth into factors of production by consuming its natural resources. The rational way to minimize the negative effects of such transformative intervention is advanced land use planning. Nevertheless, it is not possible to say that traditional modes of land use planning have fulfilled this task. The main reason for this failure is the habit of using traditional decision making tools which, to a significant level, are technically incompatible to deal with such a task. Hopefully, recent improvements in planning support tools have potential to process and evaluate complex geographical data. This paper benefits from these tools and moves one step further by performing a land assignment model, which operates binary integer programming and geographical information systems in a way that it can deal with different land use scenarios. This new methodology, which named as inquired land assignment model (ILAM), is applied for three different land use scenarios at upper level planning scale for a case area – Hillsborough County in Florida, USA. Outputs represent reasonable and consistent land use assignment and allocation results, and the model is potentially applicable to various fields and lower scales of planning practices by simple modifications.

AB  - Selecting sustainable suppliers is one of the important tasks of decision makers to survive in today's competitive businesses. One of the uses of data envelopment analysis (DEA) is to provide improvement solutions (benchmarks) for inefficient decision making units (DMUs). In classical DEA models, improvement solutions are merely proposed by one of the triple approaches including input-oriented, output-oriented, and hybrid approaches. However, based on the congestion approach of the “theory of economies of scale”, in some cases, the benchmarks derived from the triple approaches are not sufficiently precise. In “theory of economies of scale”, sometimes with an increase in inputs we see more increment in outputs (Wei and Yan, 2004). This means that the triple approaches do not consider all contributing factors of inefficiencies of DMUs. In other words, the triple approaches overlook the shortage of congested inputs as an inefficiency reason of DMUs. Focusing solely on triple approaches cannot always be correct given that sometimes inefficiency reason for some DMUs is due to a shortage of inputs. The objective of this paper, accordingly, is to consider congestion approach (congested inputs) in evaluations of DMUs. To do so, we propose a novel DEA model to show that an increase in congested inputs may lead to higher outputs/efficiency. By so doing, the reliability of improvement solutions are increased. Here, a DEA model is developed to assess the sustainability of suppliers. Also, the congestion of DMUs is detected in pairwise comparisons. A case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the presented model.

AB  - As key social nodes and development engines, the status of various cities is important for the construction of “the Silk Road Economic Belt” and “21st Century Maritime Silk Road” (hereafter called the “B&R”). To comprehensively evaluate the status of cities along the B&R, the concept of urban ecosystem health was applied in this paper, and an innovative assessment framework of “structure-function-process-development” was proposed based on the understanding of the concept of urban ecosystem health. Then, four-layer assessment indicators were established to reflect the health status of urban ecosystems. Subsequently, a fuzzy matter-element model was constructed to measure the urban ecosystem health status, grade the health levels, and identify the limiting factors. A case study was conducted on 14 typical Chinese cities along the B&R. The temporal dynamics indicated that the health states of most of these cities gradually improved during the study period. With respect to spatial differences, city types could be ranked from high to low health in the order of coastal innovative and open cities, inland open cities, and open-window cities. Based on further analysis of limiting factors, suggestions to improve the ecosystem health levels of cities along the “B&R” were proposed for the different types of cities.

AB  - Energy storages introduce many advantages such as balancing generation and demand, power quality improvement, smoothing the renewable resource’s intermittency, and enabling ancillary services like frequency and voltage regulation in microgrid (MG) operation. Hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) characterized by coupling of two or more energy storage technologies are emerged as a solution to achieve the desired performance by combining the appropriate features of different technologies. A single ESS technology cannot fulfill the desired operation due to its limited capability and potency in terms of lifespan, cost, energy and power density, and dynamic response. Hence, different configurations of HESSs considering storage type, interface, control method, and the provided service have been proposed in the literature. This paper comprehensively reviews the state of the art of HESSs system for MG applications and presents a general outlook of developing HESS industry. Important aspects of HESS utilization in MGs including capacity sizing methods, power converter topologies for HESS interface, architecture, controlling, and energy management of HESS in MGs are reviewed and classified. An economic analysis along with design methodology is also included to point out the HESS from investor and distribution systems engineers view. Regarding literature review and available shortcomings, future trends of HESS in MGs are proposed.

AB  - Traffic guide signs play important roles in people’s daily lives. However, the effectiveness and performance of traffic guide signs at intersections are significantly impacted by many factors, such as the types of information on traffic signs, their information volume and comprehensibility, the behavioral attributes of drivers, the geometric features of roadways, and weather and visibility conditions. When deploying traffic guide signs, efforts are needed to clarify whether the installation of a traffic guide sign is warranted. In this study, a generic approach is developed to examine and evaluate the effectiveness of traffic guide signs using simulation experiments. A traffic guide sign evaluation method (TGSEM) is developed and illustrated using examples of traffic guide sign schemes in suburban Beijing. The questionnaires showed that most drivers feel that the current traffic guide signs in suburban Beijing are insufficient and need to be rectified. Then, simulation experiments were conducted. Based on subjective experiments, the ergonomic evaluation model (DCI, the abbreviation of demand, comprehension, and information volume) was obtained. Of the four schemes, scheme 3 was shown to be the most popular. During driving simulation experiments, the analyses of average speed, standard deviation (SD) of speed, average acceleration, standard deviation of acceleration, travel time, braking frequency and throttle power showed that scheme 2 had a better impact on drivers’ behavioral data. Finally, Grey relational analysis showed that scheme 2 has the highest degree of correlation and can be recommended to traffic management departments. The experimental tests and analysis results revealed that the TGSEM is suitable. The proposed approach provides a generic framework with which to assess the performance of traffic guide signs and their effectiveness at intersections, including their experimental design, data analysis, the implementation of simulation models, and data interpretation.

AB  - At present, companies are increasingly pressed to respond to ecological development issues. Little research, however, links green supply chain (GSC) to companies' business performance. This paper uses top brands' micro-data and the Corporate Information Transparency Index (CITI) developed by environmental non-governmental organizations to explore the causal relationship between GSC behavior and business performance in China. Based on a big database, the CITI can be used to reflect the GSC behaviors of selected brand enterprises by tracking which brand enterprises choose the products of hundreds of thousands of polluting enterprises as raw materials. The results show that GSC behavior measured by the CITI has a significant positive impact on the business performance measured by both return on assets and return on main business. Using the Baidu index as an instrumental variable for the CITI and the two-stage least squares (2SLS) method, the causal relationship is still robust. Furthermore, we investigate the influence mechanism of the CITI on the business performance. We find that a greater board size and female proportion in the board tend to have negative effects on a company's green supply chain decision-making, while a company whose chief executive officer holds a PhD degree is more willing to choose greener supplier.

AB  - Vulnerability studies often measure the risk that influences a system's ability to react during the occurrence of a hazardous event. Risk is generally associated with the physical, social, and economic aspects of the system. Climate-related hazards such as floods involve an additional spatial dimension, however. It is challenging combining social and geophysical vulnerabilities to model their interrelations to overall flood vulnerability. This study proposes the partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) with several latent variables of geographical characteristics of houses and socioeconomic dimensions of households representing flood vulnerability. The former includes GIS/remote sensing data, while the latter comprises household surveys. The results indicate social indicators get contribution mainly from direct effects of spatial neighborhoods and socioeconomic conditions, and indirect effects of land tenure and demographics, with path coefficients equal to 0.47, 0.42, 0.83, and 0.61, respectively, all significant at the p<0.0001 level. Overall, the goodness of fit equals 0.72 indicates good explanatory power of the model. We conclude that the PLS-SEM successfully incorporated the combined vulnerability from social and geographical factors. The SEM framework allows integrative assessing vulnerability variables from different disciplines, formats, and scales, and thus, offers an opportunity for creating more tailored policies to combat hazards.

AB  - The present research work is one of initial effort to develop a sustainable smart city (SSC) structural framework in developing economies especially in Indian context. To accomplish this objective, the present work employs a hybrid Best Worst Method (BWM) – Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) approach. In this work, various key enablers influencing SSC development are extracted through literature. The BWM technique is utilised to identify their intensity of influence and ISM is used to develop a structural framework for successfully executing the SSC development projects. Several major categories of enablers, such as energy and environmental, infrastructural, strategy and policy oriented, informational and technological, social and personal, and mobility possess strong influence on SSC development agenda. The results reveals that sustainable resources management, development of smart buildings, advanced research and development system, and intelligent transportation are the key enablers of the developed framework. The fuzzy MICMAC analysis further assists in computing the driving power and dependence of the enablers. This research work will be beneficial for policy makers and practitioners in understanding of smart city development and would certainly help to grow nations’ economy by generating higher employment, foreign investments, and developing superior technological advancements.

AB  - mHealth is an innovative, mobile application based system, which has the ability to assist people to manage their health better. With the increasing number of mHealth applications, it is very difficult to choose the ideal application. As of now, very limited studies have been carried out on mHealth application selection. To fill the existing research gaps, this study endeavours to develop a model for mHealth application selection by adopting a combined approach of AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS. The hierarchical model has been developed using factors identified from literature review and expert opinions. The ambiguity in comparing different mHealth applications has been handled by applying fuzzy set theory. The AHP has been used to determine the weights of criteria and sub-criteria, and the fuzzy-TOPSIS method has been used to obtain the final ranking of the applications. The applicability of the proposed model has been discussed through a numerical case example. The sensitivity analysis has been carried out by changing the weights of the criteria. In this study, user satisfaction, functionality, easy to learn and use, and information quality, have come out as important factors in mHealth application selection. The proposed method will help users as well as medical practitioners to select the proper mHealth application in this digital world.

AB  - African Buffalo Optimization (ABO) is a latest bio-inspired optimization technique in the domain of evolutionary optimization, which mimics the migratory behaviour of the buffalo foraging for food across the African plains and forests. The ABO is, by now, recognized as a single-objective optimization algorithm, comprising the ability to solve both, the continuous and discrete optimization problems. However, a multi-objective version of ABO could be more useful for industrial problems. An aim is made in this article to develop the multi-objective variant of ABO, namely NSBUF II, which incorporates Pareto search for non-dominated solutions in the state space and a local search module for faster convergence. Selection of parameters for the NSBUF II is extremely sensitive to the obtained Pareto fronts. Thus, a Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) coupled with Taguchi’s L16 orthogonal array is adopted, which efficiently obtains the best set of parameters for the NSBUF II. Initially the proposed NSBUF II is tested using utilization based bi-objective production cell design problem and compared with published Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA II) successfully. To analyse the performance of the NSBUF II, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is applied, which is a powerful tool for visualizing the high-dimensional data in low dimensional maps. Applied SOM visually reveals the hidden correlational structure among the design parameters and the objective space. The performance of the NSBUF II is validated statistically NSBUF II is further verified with a real-world case obtained based on the Abrasive Water Jet Machining (AWJM) process. Validation test proves the competence of the proposed NSBUF II for real-world problem solving. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, a novel multi-objective NSBUF II algorithm is developed. Second, a SOM based visual analysis is proposed to visualize the correlation among design parameters and Pareto fronts. Third, the NSBUF II is employed to solve a combinatorial production cell design problem followed by a real-world industrial problem.

AB  - To complement risk assessment, large organizations need to be resilient in order to maintain critical functioning in the face of uncertain future threats (whether the threat is environmental, cyber, security-related, social, etc.). Given the complexity of both large organizations and future threat space, it is challenging to enact programs and protocols that ensure resilience across whole organizations. We propose that large organizations can map current organizational resilience across threat event cycle phases (Plan, Absorb, Recover, Adapt) and context-specific resilience domains (Physical, Information, Cognitive, and Social) to contextualized resilience metrics. Subcomponents then can be compared to one another through dashboards or quantitative indices to facilitate decision making for resilience through identifying organizational strengths, weakness, synergies, and redundancies across its subcomponents in the context of their associated missions and capabilities. The United States Department of the Army is used as a case study example of how resilience approaches of large, complex organizations can be visualized to enable resilience insights using this methodology.

AB  - A flood hazard is one of the most common and destructive natural disasters. Flood risk reduction with non-engineering measures has become the primary goal for flood management. This paper proposes an approach to improve the flood control operation for cascade reservoirs by minimizing flood control risk. A framework of reservoir flood control operation coupled with risk assessment (RFCORA) and the corresponding RFCORA model are proposed to reduce risk. The model contains three sub-modules. A real-time reservoir flood control operation simulation module is developed, in which a flood discharge control chart is used to determine the flood magnitude, and flood release is obtained by operation rules. Entropy-weighted fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is applied to assess the risk level in the flood risk assessment module. Finally, the flood release is updated according to the developed outflow adjustment optimization module aimed at minimizing flood control risk by combing future inflow information. In addition, another model without outflow adjustment optimization is set to be a comparative experiment. The water system of the Upper Yellow River is selected as a case study to verify the model. The results show that the framework and RFCORA model developed in this paper can decrease the time duration in the highest risk level without increasing the maximum water level and maximum outflow of reservoirs. The approach proposed in this paper based on flood control operation and flood risk assessment can be extended to flood mitigation in other water systems in similar situations.

AB  - Sandy areas in the northern China are the primary regions for potato production, but limited water resources and low water/fertilizer use efficiency limit the sustainable development of agriculture. Field experiments were conducted during 2016–2017 to investigate the effects of different drip irrigation frequencies, water amounts and fertilizer rates on the yield, quality, water and fertilizer productivity of potato in the sandy areas of northern China. The water and fertilizer treatments were evaluated using the TOPSIS method to obtain the optimal combination of irrigation frequency, water amount and fertilizer rate for multi-objective optimization. The irrigation frequency included once every 4 days (D4), once every 8 days (D8) and once every 10 days (D10). The irrigation levels consisted of full irrigation (1.0 ETc, ETc is the crop evapotranspiration), medium irrigation (0.8 ETc) and low irrigation (0.6 ETc). The fertilizer (N-P2O5-K2O) levels included low fertilization (F1, 100-40-150 kg ha−1), medium fertilization (F2, 150-60-225 kg ha−1) and high fertilization (F3, 200-80-300 kg ha−1). The results showed that there were significant effects of the irrigation frequency (IF), irrigation level (IL) and fertilization level (FL) on potato growth, yield, quality, water and fertilizer productivity. Using the same irrigation frequency and fertilization level, the highest tuber yield, starch content, vitamin C and partial factor productivity (PFP) were obtained under the full irrigation (1.0 ETc). However, the irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) decreased as the water supply increased. In addition, these indicators under deficit irrigation increased with the increase in irrigation frequency at the same fertilization level, but the indicators of D8 were the highest under the full irrigation. Under the same irrigation frequency and irrigation level, the tuber yield and IWUE increased as the fertilization rate increased. However, the PFP decreased as the fertilizer rate increased. The trends in plant height, LAI, dry matter accumulation, plant yield and commodity tubers were similar to that in tuber yield. The starch content and vitamin C under deficit irrigation increased with the amount of fertilizer applied, but they increased first and then decreased with the increase in fertilizer rate under the full irrigation. The change in the content of reducing sugars was opposite to that of the starch. Based on the TOPSIS method, the multi-target optimum scheduling of potato was attained with the irrigation frequency of once every 8 days (D8), full irrigation(1.0 ETc and high fertilizer (N-P2O5-K2O) rate (F3, 200-80-300 kg ha−1). The obtained optimum combination of water and fertilizers can provide a scientific basis for irrigation and fertilization optimization and management in the sandy areas of northern China and in other regions with similar environments.

AB  - Z-number, combined with constraint and reliability of the information, is an effective frame to simulate the thinking of humans. How to derive knowledge of Z-numbers, especially from the objective data may become a fascinating and open issue. In this paper, a method of deriving knowledge of Z-numbers from the perspective of Dempster–Shafer theory is proposed. The proposed method considers the Z-number generating from objective and subjective data using Dempster–Shafer theory. Some numerical examples and experimental simulations are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

AB  - The tribological behaviour of LM6 alloy with Graphite, Si3N4 nano particle and Graphite-Si3N4 hybrid composite is investigated in this study. Al-Gr, Al-Si3N4 nano and Al-Gr-Si3N4 hybrid composites were casted by gravity die stir casting to investigate under dry sliding conditions for the wear and frictional characteristics. The wear rate & co-efficient decreased by 25% & 15% for the hybrid composite when compared with the Al-Si3N4 nano composite, whereas very minimal wear rate and co-efficient of friction was observed for Al-Gr. The results show that the Micro Vicker hardness of the Al-Gr-Si3N4 hybrid composite is 16% more than that of the nano composite and no significant variation is observed for Al-Gr and Al-Si3N4 nano composites. SEM was used to analyse the worn surface and subsurface. The predominant wear mechanisms observed were abrasive for the nano composite and adhesive and abrasive mechanism for the hybrid composite. The Al-Gr-Si3N4 hybrid composite wear rate was optimized with fuzzy logic analysis and compared with the experimental data. The fuzzy logic model was developed to evaluate the wear rate of Al-Gr-Si3N4 hybrid composite and with low prediction errors of 4.27%. The ANOVA analysis yielded the optimum parameter conditions for the wear process. The Regression model was used to estimate the relationships among the variables for the wear rate of different composites.

AB  - Nowadays, sustainability has become of increasing concern in policy and the decision making of stakeholders. Companies have been increasing their attention to their environmental performance. In order to measure sustainability performance, different approaches have been proposed. The joint application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), called LCA+DEA, is used to assess eco-efficiency, which is to produce more with less environmental impact and with fewer resources. In this manuscript, we compare two methods that implement the LCA+DEA approach, the five-step and four-step methods, focused on Carbon Footprint (CF), called CF+DEA. These methods have not been compared previously. This comparison will encompass the theoretical and practical points of view according to efficiency indices, best practices, and targets for the CF emissions. To perform this comparison, we use a case study of raspberry producers in Chile. From a practical point of view, we have observed that both methods have achieved the main objective of reducing CF. Moreover, results show similar eco-efficiency scores; the targets given by the five-step method are less demanding than those given by the four-step method. In this sense, the four-step method provides a higher average CF reduction. This is due to the inclusion of CF as an undesirable output in the DEA assessment and the use of an output-oriented DEA model. Additionally, in including the CF within the DEA assessment, the four-step method reflects better the definition of eco-efficiency. Following these results, it is advisable to implement the targets provided by the five-step method for a short term and then the targets provided by the four-step method for a mid-term or long term.
