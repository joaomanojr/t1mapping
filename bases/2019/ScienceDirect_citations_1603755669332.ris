AB  - Internet of things is a new pattern in wireless communications of things. The basic theory of IoT is the comprehensive presence of different kinds of things in surrounding environment. The three main dimensions of data security in the Internet are integration, privacy and availability. One of the major tools for maintaining the security of Internet medical things is biometric technology. Biometric systems are used in different fields of the smart healthcare. In this regard, we also need a means for identifying people’s identity based on their physical characteristics; the use of biometric data is absolutely critical for IoT functions. Considering this emerging pattern, everything integrated will connect to a virtual chain of connected things with address in the dynamic world of networks. Given the importance of secure connections of things to the Internet and access to them, biometric features are used as identifiers; because they cannot be borrowed, bought, forgotten and they are very difficult to forge or copy. The smart healthcare and IoT resulted in the emergence of a new standard in the applications of biometric data. In this paper, we present a new standard for applying biometric technology to develop smart healthcare using IoT which includes high capacity to access data in addition to being easy to use. In this paper, we reached a more secure way of accessing IoT based on biometrics and fast identity standard by which we can expect significant advances in smart healthcare systems.

AB  - Allocation and management of agricultural land is of emergent concern due to land scarcity, diminishing supply of energy and water, and the increasing demand of food globally. To achieve social, economic and environmental goals in a specific agricultural land area, people and society must make decisions subject to the demand and supply of food, energy and water (FEW). Interdependence among these three elements, the Food-Energy-Water Nexus (FEW-N), requires that they be addressed concertedly. Despite global efforts on data, models and techniques, studies navigating the multi-faceted FEW-N space, identifying opportunities for synergistic benefits, and exploring interactions and trade-offs in agricultural land use system are still limited. Taking an experimental station in China as a model system, we present the foundations of a systematic engineering framework and quantitative decision-making tools for the trade-off analysis and optimization of stressed interconnected FEW-N networks. The framework combines data analytics and mixed-integer nonlinear modeling and optimization methods establishing the interdependencies and potentially competing interests among the FEW elements in the system, along with policy, sustainability, and feedback from various stakeholders. A multi-objective optimization strategy is followed for the trade-off analysis empowered by the introduction of composite FEW-N metrics as means to facilitate decision-making and compare alternative process and technological options. We found the framework works effectively to balance multiple objectives and benchmark the competitions for systematic decisions. The optimal solutions tend to promote the food production with reduced consumption of water and energy, and have a robust performance with alternative pathways under different climate scenarios.

AB  - Global and regional scale agricultural monitoring systems aim to provide up-to-date information regarding food production to different actors and decision makers in support of global and national food security. To help reduce price volatility of the kind experienced between 2007 and 2011, a global system of agricultural monitoring systems is needed to ensure the coordinated flow of information in a timely manner for early warning purposes. A number of systems now exist that fill this role. This paper provides an overview of the eight main global and regional scale agricultural monitoring systems currently in operation and compares them based on the input data and models used, the outputs produced and other characteristics such as the role of the analyst, their interaction with other systems and the geographical scale at which they operate. Despite improvements in access to high resolution satellite imagery over the last decade and the use of numerous remote-sensing based products by the different systems, there are still fundamental gaps. Based on a questionnaire, discussions with the system experts and the literature, we present the main gaps in the data and in the methods. Finally, we propose some recommendations for addressing these gaps through ongoing improvements in remote sensing, harnessing new and innovative data streams and the continued sharing of more and more data.

AB  - Decision making techniques have been widely used in healthcare and medical industry. This study systematically reviews the conventional and fuzzy decision-making techniques applied in healthcare and medical problems. In total, we evaluated 202 published studies selected from 85 high-ranking journals, in which 130 of those published studies were directly related to the decision-making processes in healthcare and medical issues. Selected studies were classified into nine application areas: environmental sustainability, waste management, service quality, risk management, medical equipment and material selection, health technology, operation researches in healthcare, hospital healthcare services and other application areas. Furthermore, we classified the selected studies by numerous significant perspectives such as the authors, application areas, utilized techniques, publication time periods, decision-making and study goals, and significant results of the papers. The statistical results show that the year 2012 was ranked first in terms of developed studies within the period of 1989–2018. The techniques of AHP and hybrid approaches were the most frequently implemented decision-making technique in healthcare fields. Notably, the results also show that decision-making approaches and techniques are mostly applied to evaluate and rank different applications of service quality in healthcare and medical industries.

AB  - Collaborative filtering is an emerging recommender system technique that aims guiding users based on other customers preferences with behavioral similarities. Such correspondences are located based on preference history of users. A relatively new extension of traditional collaborative filtering schemes takes into account not only how much a user likes an item, but also why she likes the item by collecting multi-criteria preferences focusing on distinctive features of the items. These multi-criteria collaborative filtering systems have the potential to improve recommender system accuracy since they reveal multiple views of users on products. However, due to providing more insightful recommendations, such systems might be subjected to malicious attacks more substantially than the traditional ones. Attackers attempt to insert fake profiles to bias outputs of these systems in favor of a particular product or disrepute the system itself. Since outputs of expert systems directly dependent on input signals; interventions to the inputs coherently cause failures on productions of such systems. In this study, we examine shilling attack strategies against multi-criteria preference collections, how to extend well-known attack scenarios against these systems, and propose an alternative attacking scheme. We analyze the robustness of baseline multi-criteria recommendation algorithms regarding various similarity aggregation procedures against proposed attacking schemes by the extensive experimental investigation. Empirical results on real-world data demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to manipulations and proper attack detection practices are needed to ensure recommendation quality. According to our findings, manipulative attempts at such expert systems mislead decision-making process.

AB  - The growing role of sustainability in the construction industry must be considered in the entire lifecycle of a building. This way BIM (Building Information Modeling) figures as an important factor in the management of this lifecycle, from design and construction, through the operation and maintenance until the demolition. An efficient interoperability along the lifecycle supported by BIM allows an overall better management and help users to improve sustainability of projects. This interoperability must consider not only data, but also should be concerned with broader aspects, such as processes and guidelines, avoiding information loss, facilitating analysis, and therefore, improving sustainability. In the light of this scenario, a systematic literature review was performed considering sustainability factors, interoperability concerns and lifecycle stages. This review was based on existing methods complemented by a multicriteria decision analysis method to aid the selection of relevant papers. Also, a qualitative data analysis was performed to identify the relations of the fields studied. Results showed that even though some fields receive much attention in the literature, few studies are performed considering interoperability in the entire lifecycle of sustainable buildings. Also, results showed the relevant connections among lifecycle stages and sustainability fields, providing an influence matrix of these two areas. This review can be used as a tool to organize knowledge and data and systematize processes and even to structure interoperability frameworks.

AB  - Existing approaches for person re-identification have concentrated on either designing the best feature representation or learning optimal matching metrics in a static setting where the number of cameras are fixed in a network. Most approaches have neglected the dynamic and open world nature of the re-identification problem, where one or multiple new cameras may be temporarily on-boarded into an existing system to get additional information or added to expand an existing network. To address such a very practical problem, we propose a novel approach for adapting existing multi-camera re-identification frameworks with limited supervision. First, we formulate a domain perceptive re-identification method based on geodesic flow kernel that can effectively find the best source camera (already installed) to adapt with newly introduced target camera(s), without requiring a very expensive training phase. Second, we introduce a transitive inference algorithm for re-identification that can exploit the information from best source camera to improve the accuracy across other camera pairs in a network of multiple cameras. Third, we develop a target-aware sparse prototype selection strategy for finding an informative subset of source camera data for data-efficient learning in resource constrained environments. Our approach can greatly increase the flexibility and reduce the deployment cost of new cameras in many real-world dynamic camera networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised alternatives whilst being extremely efficient to compute.

Even though, there are various methods forselectingprojects, most of these methods not consider about the satisfaction of the designer and collaboration ability of the designer. Therefore, we studied designer’s satisfaction to design projects and collaboration ability in design projects in the design project selection process. In this paper, we propose a project selection method, which consider about the designers’ satisfaction to the candidate multi-project and collaboration ability in the candidate multi-project. The main objective of our research is to help project manager to find an adaptable and comfortable multi- project to the designer.

AB  - Industry 4.0 principal is based on the use of more smart production tools, such as robots which are considered as one of the most important innovation that Industry 4.0 is going to widely use for its implementation. These intelligent components of the factory (robots) can execute complex tasks and can make local decisions. Task allocation in this context should satisfy several requirements in terms of time, cost and utilisation rate of production tools. Some expensive tools like grippers or robotic arms are used sporadically during the execution of tasks. In order to increase the utilisation rate of these kind of devices, several methods can be deployed. Effective and safe resources’ sharing between different production tools and process operations is one of the most important challenges for Industry 4.0 implementation. This paper presents an overview of Multi-Robots Task Allocation (MRTA) based on shared resources constraints for flexible and reconfigurable manufacturing systems. We found that there is few work on the scheduling and MRTA with shared resources. An illustrative industrial case based on gripper sharing is presented to illustrate the complexity of this problem. Several research directions are pointed out and discussed in the conclusion.

AB  - Pumped storage hydropower system has now become a key support for integration of variable renewable energy. Along with the large-scale development of pumped storage plants all over the world, the importance of operation strategy is rapidly increasing with the fast-growing demand of flexibility. How to direct flexible operation and improve the stability of the system has become a key issue. This paper proposes a novel optimization framework to derive optimal operating policies for pumped storage hydropower system, which is divided into three coordinated stages: nonlinear modeling, strategy optimization and decision making. The real-time accurate equivalent circuit model is proposed in first stage, which can reconcile the conflict between simulation efficiency and accuracy, owing to the novel pump-turbine model and space-time discretization. The search corridor which consists of multiple constraints is defined to improve search efficiency. Reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm is performed to handle non-normalization objectives, multiple constraints and irregular Pareto fronts in second stage. Further, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is innovatively introduced to select compatible solution under extreme conditions. The originality of the framework is embodied in multiple trade-offs, i.e. trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in the nonlinear model, trade-off between convergence and diversity in the strategy optimization, and trade-off in conflicting objectives of the decision making. Compared with the on-site operation, the maximum water pressure of volute and the vacuum at draft tube can be improved by 5.59% and 9.6%, the rotational speed oscillation also decreases with this framework in load rejection. The proposed framework can specify the optimal policy to enhance the system reliability, which can also serve as the basis for smart operation in various conditions.

AB  - Software-as-a-service (SaaS) has attracted substantial attention as a software delivery and service model in a cloud computing environment. SaaS delivery can help organizations significantly reduce the cost of using software, because the resources for running SaaS applications are shared among tenants (end users or organizations). However, multi-tenancy can considerably complicate SaaS development, deployment, and maintenance as a result of a large number of co-existing tenant-specific constraints or features. Manually configuring and maintaining tenant-specific features will increase the cost, introduce possible errors, and limit scalability and flexibility. The paper addresses the problem of large variations and complex configurations. Specifically, the objective is to develop mechanisms to support automatic multi-tenant software features analysis and matching for the purposes of efficient deployment and operations in the cloud. The emphasis of this paper is on the matching between the tenant-specific requirements and the SaaS features managed by the cloud provider. This paper proposes a novel approach for cloud feature matching using XML filtering techniques to support the process of multi-tenant SaaS deployment and management. Feature modeling has been widely used to capture requirements and constraints. On the other hand, XML filtering techniques are mature and have been adopted in various problem domains. We used Yfilter, a proven and XML filtering technique, to support two multi-tenant applications: (i) Identifying SaaS configurations (in XPath representations) that satisfy tenant-specific requirements and constraints (in XML notation); and (ii) Identifying tenants that have subscribed to a specific set of SaaS features. The applications can effectively facilitate SaaS subsequent management and operations due to various changes, e.g., functionalities, constraints, cost, etc. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can automatically and correctly identify cloud system configurations that match tenant-specific requirements or identify the group of tenants that have subscribed to a particular set of cloud features. In addition, the execution time of our proposed approach is only a small fraction compared to the existing approach using the formal method, e.g., FaMa, and the configuration space is also much smaller.

AB  - Assessing sustainability in supply chains is an important task for any organization in the competitive business environment. The process of assessing the sustainability of a supply chain involves incorporating different sources of information, which are normally uncertain, incomplete, and subjective in nature. However, previous studies have failed to incorporate such uncertain, incomplete and subjective information. Therefore, this research proposes a methodology that uses an integrated approach combining the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Hierarchical Evidential Reasoning (HER) based on Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory to develop a supply chain sustainability assessment model. After identifying the sustainability assessment criteria, Analytical Hierarchy Process is used to structure and rate the criteria based on experts' opinion. In this research, subjective judgmental belief data are used to test the model. The information is combined using Dempster-Shafer theory and results are depicted according to the supply chain sustainability index. In the proposed mode, the results from the Dempster-Shafer theory are compared using Yager's recursive rule of combination. The model generates satisfactory results which denotes the condition state of sustainability along with unassigned degree of belief or uncertainty. To assess the sustainability condition in supply chain this methodology can be adopted by the management of the organizations.

AB  - Over the last two decades, due to strong decentralization and widespread budget constraints, the Italian co-payment for health care has become a way to finance public health. This phenomenon has provoked a continuous increase of private costs of public health and an evident regional heterogeneity. As a result, a pervasive spatial inequality of access to public health care is becoming increasingly clear. The aim of this paper is to measure this inequality, mainly determined by the differences among regional co-payment prices. Access, equity, and needs are all part of the phenomenon ‘inequality of access’, and they are difficult to define and measure in health care. For this reason, most of the previously proposed measurement methods have inherent limitations and have prompted us to use an innovative approach focused exclusively on the supply side. In particular, we focus only on the cost of health benefits (co-payment). From a methodological perspective, we use a recent new version of the Stochastic Multiobjective Acceptability Analysis (SMAA), which is a methodology mainly used to build composite indicators of multidimensional phenomena out of the market. In order to deal with the hierarchical structure of the Italian health care system, we use the Hierarchy Stochastic Multiobjective Acceptability Analysis (HSMAA), which takes into account the uncertainty with respect to the weights assigned to the considered criteria, as in the standard SMAA, but also the uncertainty with respect to the weights assigned to the considered sub-criteria. Applying for the first time HSMAA to measure inequality allows us to create a unique index for each region and then to make a classification among them. The results show that, since there are different prices for the same health benefits among different regions, there are strong spatial inequalities in the cost of the Essential Levels of health care in Italy.

The proposed approach is presented by an IDEF0 activity model to create the context in which data requirements and data flows are defined for the selection. The preliminary process planning content of this approach covers traditional and AM process selection problem, where the decision maker has to select the most appropriate technology to manufacture the desired product. The following steps will be devoted to AM process planning. Therefore, the most appropriate alternative for fabrication with AM is selected by investigating the criteria as resource specifications and manufacturability analysis, as well as accuracy performance. This evaluation system has been applied as a step-by-step methodology that employs well-known procedures, such as screening, comparative assessment, and ranking process to select the most suitable alternative for production with AM. Finally, the proposed approach is illustrated by an industrial case study, and it provides a DfAM guideline for engineers and researchers in the early phase of the product development process.

AB  - Flash floods in Egypt are considered frequent meteorological natural hazards. Qena is one of the most Egyptian governorates prone to flash floods. Various flash floods events hit Qena from 1954 till 2016. Flash floods occurred in Qena on 28th October 2016 inundated houses and roads, generated losses in lives, damages to private and public property. The intensive rainfall coupled with the rapid urban expansion in Qena and along the Nile Valley could worsen the situation. Despite, the destructive impacts of the flash floods in Qena, flash floods can be used as a valuable source of fresh water as the study area is classified as an arid zone and characterized with the fresh-water shortage. Integration of remotely sensed data with the Analytical Hierarchy Process and Geographic Information Systems spatial modeling presented valuable analysis techniques in this study. The present study focused on mapping the spatial distribution of flash floods vulnerability in Qena's urban areas. Ten indicators were used to analyze the flood floods namely; rainfall, soil, geology, slope, elevation, flow direction, drainage network, land cover, total population, and population density. The results revealed that Qena, Qus, Naqadah, and Dishna urban districts are the most vulnerable to flash floods and located in the very high zone with 25.3%, 14.9%, 12.3%, and 9.8% respectively. The total population situated at very high and high vulnerability zone reached represents 7.66% and 43.36% of the total population. The obtained results considered crucial information for decision-makers for future effective flash floods hazards mitigation, assessment management, planning, and sustainable development.

AB  - A multi-objective optimization of injection molding for determination of feasible moldability index was investigated in this study. The feasible moldability indices were calculated by implementing Taguchi method and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process with the order performance by its similarity to the ideal solution technique. Major process parameters of the injection molding like melt temperature, gate design, filling and cooling times were selected as variables to minimize common manufacturing defects like shrinkage, warpage and short shot. The analytic hierarchy process was used to set initial weights of variables and seriousness of each defect was evaluated by fuzzy decision-making process. Finite Element Analysis of the injection molding process was performed for selected work piece using polypropylene material. Results showed that it is more convenient to calculate several sets of variable parameters with high moldability indices, rather than focusing on single configuration with the highest moldability index. It is clear that the combination of Taguchi with TOPSIS and FAHP gives more applicable alternatives with high moldability indices, if the solution with highest moldability index in not practical.

AB  - Globally, even as environmental protection and sustainability are becoming increasingly important, freight transportation firms are faced with the enormous need to reduce the significant environmental burdens that accrue from transport vehicles. Eco-innovation can aid freight transport firms through fostering sustainable transportation alternatives at best possible costs to ensure effective decision- making for freight logistics sustainability. Yet, freight logistics companies are faced with numerous difficulties when attempting to implement eco-innovation practices along their supply chains. This paper therefore identifies the challenges to implementing eco-innovation practices for freight logistics sustainability to aid management to take informed decisions to overcome these challenges before the environmental burdens become critical. The Best- Worst method is adopted to evaluate and rank these challenges in terms of their relative importance in Nigeria, an emerging economy, which is characterized by increased consumption due to huge population size coupled with government green requirements. The results depict that unavailable funds, lack of clarity on the financial benefits of eco-innovation practices, poor technology infrastructure and reluctant attitude towards eco-innovation practices are the most pressing challenges amongst the challenges faced by Nigeria freight logistics companies. These results will provide insight and guidelines for decision-makers and policymakers in the freight logistics sector who seeks to integrate eco-innovation initiatives to achieve sustainability.

AB  - Highway agencies have been using many of the elements of asset management with the support of various decision-making tools. To determine the most effective investment strategy with scarce resources, the integration, and hence better utilization, of existing tools and practices across asset classes is generally lacking. This paper applies data envelopment analysis (DEA) to benchmark different highway investment scenarios using existing data or data readily available through existing models. Three asset types, pavements, bridges, and traffic signage, are investigated. Asset investment analysis results from the Highway Economic Requirements System State Version (HERS-ST) application, the PONTIS bridge management system software, and purpose-built traffic signage spreadsheet are obtained to capture the changes of performance measures under various budget scenarios and are further used as the inputs for the DEA process to benchmark investment scenarios for each individual asset. Subsequently, the performance measures and budget levels are assembled in the Asset Manager-NT software, whose results are input into DEA to benchmark cross-assets resource allocation scenarios. Planning for the management of highway network is addressed via case studies in a systematic manner that recognizes the tradeoffs among different funding periods and objectives such as preserving existing investments, safety, roughness and user costs. This study has established a preliminary implementable framework of highway asset management by linking DEA approach and current widely used decision-making tools for more efficient investments within and cross assets, and better understand of the tradeoffs, costs and consequences of various asset management decisions.

AB  - The Hawai'i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS) is an experiment simulating long-duration life in a Mars habitat. Power for the habitat is generated by a photovoltaic system that exhibits daily variation in production rates. During days with cloud cover, the crew need to adapt their work schedule and support systems to ensure they can continue to function under low-power constraints. This paper accordingly presents the development and implementation of power budget profiles for low-, medium-, and high-power production days during Mission 5 of the HI-SEAS experiment. The applied power budget profiles limit which systems and devices can be used and for what duration. To generate these profiles, the HI-SEAS power subsystem was first characterized though power audits and data from daily crew use trends. The methods used to determine a prioritized list of habitat equipment for crew-member usage and compliance with restrictions are then discussed. Finally, an optimization method is proposed to determine the most efficient schedule to match each power usage profile with respect to crew preferences. The data from this experiment provide a novel opportunity to gain insight into power usage in space exploration habitats, establishing a foundation for the development of proper power generation and management technologies. Thus, this research can be used to provide meaningful guidance to most manned space systems in ensuring optimal power consumption under a variety of power generation conditions.

AB  - The present study investigates multiple geo-envrionmental parameters for delineating groundwater potential zones in Chittar basin, Tamil Nadu using GIS based analytical hierarchical process (AHP) technique. The parameters contributing groundwater recharge and sub-surface flow such as geology, lineaments, geomorphology, slope, drainage density, soil and rainfall are spatially explored at site-specific level based on the expert guidelines of AHP systematic weighted analysis. In this analysis, each thematic layer of contributing parameter is mathematically calculated for normalized weights and geometric mean in order to determine its rule to identify potential groundwater prospects at pixel (10 × 10 m) scale level. The result map indicates the potentiality of groundwater availability in various parts of the study area. In which, the area covers 162.84 km2 (6.6%) are identified with higher groundwater prospectus, that occurs under confined aquifers lay down along the flow path of river channel; whereas the poor groundwater potential found in the area of 180.52 km2 (7.37%) in the western parts due to leaking or discharge from unconfined aquifers towards east-down directions. The result is validated using field-estimated groundwater optimum yield for the 24 open wells located across the study area and the among them 17 wells are highly correlated with the derived measurements, i.e. the higher groundwater potential in Keelapavoor in south-west parts and poor groundwater availability in Devarkulam and surrounded areas and the overall accuracy is agreed at 71%. Higher groundwater potential found along some parts due to presence of lineaments occurred in weathered and jointed rocks that transmitting surface runoff into the confined aquifers; however, zones covered by massive weathered rocky layers prevails poor groundwater sources in many parts of the study area. The GIS based AHP method is effectively performed for identification of groundwater potential zone in the hard rock terrain and the information sources can be used for planning the sustainable groundwater management.

In this sense, we first provide a critical taxonomy of extant studies, as these are mapped on strategic, tactical and operational levels of the hierarchical decision-making process. Sustainability constituents along with the considered supply or demand viewpoints are also mapped. Following, we recognize and classify the major elaborated performance metrics used to monitor and assess the sustainable performance of electricity systems. We then integrate the recognized decision-making process with the physical systems' perspective to demonstrate the complex and dynamic nature of the electricity systems. Our critical analysis reveals that sustainability and energy security are rapidly evolving research fields; however, the often myopic perspective of the reviewed studies hinders the effective evaluation and analysis of renewable energy systems. Our analysis further allows for the identification of gaps and overlaps in literature, as well as of future research areas.

AB  - The wastage of metal chips from conventional drilling process creates massive environmental pollution. In order to reduce emission pollution, this process should be replaced by the green technology of thermal drilling process. Thermal drilling is an energy efficient, clean and chip less drilling method that has attracted more automotive and aerospace manufacturers in recent years. The processing time, tool failure and manufacturing cost of drilling are reduced and the bushing formation is three times thicker than the workpiece, which offers a prolonged bearing area that fits a shaft firmly. However, achieving these objectives is time consuming and leads to material waste for industrial sectors. Here, we propose a robust methodology that combines experiments with modern optimization technique in order to solve the industrial challenge and further improve the drilling quality. The experiments were conducted on galvanized steel material with different thicknesses (1 mm, 1.5 mm and 2 mm). Three thermal drilling tools are developed using M2 tool steel with three different geometry angles such as 30o, 37.5o and 45o. The recommended level (A3 B1 C2) identified in this experimental research, allows to minimize the thermal drilling parameters with intended benefits of the output parameters. It permits to identify the best solution of minimum surface roughness of 1.088 μm with the roundness error of 0.080 mm and 0.145 mm run-out. Further, the multi-objective decision technique designed offer contribution details of critical input parameters contribution of rotational speed, tool angle, and workpiece as 76.58%, 10.56%, and 1.982%, respectively.

AB  - This paper introduces a product-related dependency index that can be used during the conceptual design of mechatronic systems. The index uses fuzzy assessment of adverse effects dependencies combined with quantitative graph theory to compute the level of detrimental interactions present in a system. The paper also illustrates how the assessment of dependencies can be performed during early design stages and how components are differently affected by a specific adverse effect. Furthermore, the practicality of the new dependency index is exemplified with two case studies: a design experiment on a self-balancing robot and the conceptual design of a robotic arm for aerial manipulation. The design experiment demonstrates how adverse effects affect the performance of a mechatronic system and how the new dependency index is able to follow the decrease or increase of performance of the system. Then, the design of the robotic arm shows that decision-making can be improved when using this new dependency index as a criterion, as it allows one to select concepts for which less detrimental interactions exist. In both case studies, the index is shown to facilitate the design process as it can lead to fewer redesign loops which would result in reducing the development time and costs.

AB  - Bike trajectories generated by the dockless bike-sharing service provides a great opportunity to explore users' travel behavior within the shared mobility transportation ecosystem. This paper proposes a new concept, namely biking islands, defined as geographical areas of interest with a high concentration of bike usage. Leveraging high-resolution trajectory data, biking islands are identified via percolation theory because of its suitability in describing the formation of clusters and critical road segments that have significant influence on biking behavior in an urban context. We showcase our methodology using the bike trajectory dataset provided by a market-leading company and use Shanghai, China as the study area. Results reveal a hierarchical structure of biking islands. With the increase of threshold, the biking islands start to shrink and split into various smaller ones. Larger biking islands are usually located in the central urban area of Shanghai and the Huangpu River acts as a natural barrier that impedes biking continuity across the region. Besides, the formation of biking islands is highly influenced by the surrounding land uses. The proposed concept and methods are not only helpful to understand travel behavior of cyclists and urban structures used for cycling, but also has the potential to support relevant urban and transportation planning, such as identifying designated non-motorized areas for cycling and biking facilities and pinpointing critical road segments that can improve the cycling efficiency of the entire network. Biking islands could be designed as designated areas for cycling where sufficient bike facilities are provided, and/or motorized transport modes are restricted or even prohibited, so as to ensure the convenience and safety of cyclists and support the development of bike-friendly cities.

AB  - One of the main questions in cloud computing environments is how to efficiently distribute user requests or Virtual Machines (VMs) based on their resource needs over time. This question is also an important one when dealing with a cloud federation environment where rational cloud service providers are collaborating together by sharing customer requests. By considering intrinsic aspects of the cloud computing model one can propose request distribution methods that play on the strengths of this computing paradigm. In this paper we look at statistical multiplexing and server consolidation as such a strength and examine the use of the coefficient of variation and other related statistical metrics as objective functions which can be used in deciding on the request distribution mechanism. The complexity of using these objective functions is analyzed and heuristic methods which enable efficient request partitioning in a feasible time are presented & compared.

In the present study, we have explored the nature of the physical vulnerability of wetland using logistic regression (LR) and fuzzy logic (FL) approaches for both pre and post-dam periods. LR is selected because initial vulnerable is identified and FL is used to explore the best possible alternative interwoven relation among the parameters. Seven parameters like (Water presence frequency (WPF) map, Flood inundation map (2d hydraulic model) (FIM), Frequency of pixel being non permanent (NPW), Agriculture presence frequency (APF) map, Fragmentation of wetland (FoW), Normalized differences built-up index (NDBI), and Wetland changes (WC)) are employed for this study. Result reveals that 9.97 and 8.99% wetland areas were under high and very high vulnerability as per LR model but it is increased to 23.35% and 12.52% in post-dam period. Similarly, as per FL model, very high vulnerable wetland habitat is increased from 9.93% to 25.28%. Sensitivity analysis using Kappa coefficient and Receiver operating curve shows the validity of the models. About 31–68% flow reduction in Atreyee river in post-dam period, squeezing of 25.80% active flood-prone zone, agricultural extensions are identified as the major reasons behind growing wetland vulnerability. Vulnerable wetland habitat will automatically reduce productivity and service capability of the wetland ecosystem. Cause optimization may be the vital step for reducing the vulnerability. Ecological flow estimation and downstream release of water can play a decisive role for arresting the growing trend of vulnerability.

AB  - With the advance of technology, radical innovation plays an increasing essential role in gaining competitive advantages by leveraging the brandy new technologies such as internet of things (IoT) in product or services innovations. Although its importance is widely recognized, the mechanism of radical innovation is still poorly understood due to high level of uncertainty about its prospects. This paper aims to evaluate the radicality of design ideas from their technological changes that are the obvious and measurable characteristics of radical innovation at very beginning of their developments. To do so, a radicality evaluation method is formulated after a systematic review of studies on radical innovation and integrating of ideas evaluations methods in relevant domains. Afterwards, two radicality computing formulas are regressed through a statistical analysis of known design cases. The feasibility of the formulas is verified by a serial of recognized radical innovations followed by a case study that is related to additive manufacturing. Its application in new product development is demonstrated by a design project of adhering devices. The proposed method has potential to fertilize studies on radical innovation and knowledge-based innovation.

AB  - Effective decision-making based on quantitative analysis is limited by analysts’ abilities to visualize and interpret data and information, a critical challenge in sustainability performance assessment. Non-experts, including students and marketing/finance professionals, often lack experience in interpreting complex data and results, increasing the difficulty of evaluating product sustainability performance. A lack of robust and clear visualization frameworks represents a barrier in advancing the efficacy of sustainability analyses, the tools used for such analyses, and the decisions based on them, exacerbated by the gap between research and industry practice. Emerging and ongoing efforts are investigated by reviewing the research literature on the visual communication of quantitative sustainability performance information and by collecting direct input from sustainability assessment practitioners. While the communication of complicated and uncertain results is an active area of research, prior visualization tool development efforts in support of sustainable product, process, and supply chain design decision-making have found little commercial application. Viewed as a thorny challenge by practitioners, our analysis did not find universal guidance for visualization, but it did uncover best practices for presenting actionable sustainability analysis results that could provide a starting point. Based on the intersection of the literature analysis and primary source interviews, we provide a snapshot of the current state in the field and present potential research avenues.

AB  - Cloud-assisted internet of things (CIoT) is backboned by the wireless sensor network (WSN) architecture. A sensor network is an autonomous self-resource constraint collection of internet of things (IoT) sensor nodes. The nodes communicate in an ad-hoc fashion to transfer cloud information over the virtual environment. Clustering in WSNs helps to improve the quality of the network by controlling energy consumption and improving data gathering accuracy. This improves the service rates of CIoT. Optimizing IoT sensor networks through energy and overhead management requires complex clustering algorithms. A simple clustering scheme cannot achieve the desired performance enhancement during transmission in a virtual environment. This research attempts to propose a reinforcement-based learning technique, adaptive Q-learning (AQL) to improve network performance with minimum energy–overhead tradeoff in a sensor network-aided CIoT. AQL operates in two distinct phases for cluster head selection and forwarder selection. The decision-making system is used to qualify nodes based on their past behavior over transmission. AQL improves both inter- and intra-cluster communication optimization through adaptive forwarder and header selection conditions. The simulation results prove the consistency of the proposed AQL by retaining the live node counts in the network and their persistent energy despite the reduced overheads in the sensor network. With the achievement of constructive features in the sensor networks, the performance of CIoT is considerably improved. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning technique by improving network lifetime with a high request–response rate and by minimizing delay, overhead, and request failures.

AB  - Reverse logistics (RL) has been regarded as a key driving force for remanufacturing. However, there are great uncertainties in terms of quality and quantity of used components for RL. There are also complexities in suppliers and operations. These make decision-making of RL very complex. In order to identify the best collection mode for used components, a demand-matching oriented Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method is established. In this method, the damage level and remaining service life are firstly incorporated into the evaluation criteria of reuse modes, then a hybrid method (AHP-EW) that integrates Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Entropy Weight (EW) method is applied to derive criteria weights and the grey Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC) is adopted to rank the collection modes. Finally, sensitivity analysis is implemented to test the stability of the proposed method, and a demands-matching method is proposed to validate and evaluate the feasibility of the optimal alternative. The collection of used pressurizers is taken as case study to validate the applicability of the proposed model. The results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method in MCDM of RL.

AB  - Thin-walled structure is widely used in automobile, aviation and other industrial fields due to its lightweight, high energy absorption efficiency and low cost. Four thin-walled hybrid multi-cell structures with circular and square sections are proposed in this paper. The energy absorption characteristics and crushing deformation of the hybrid structures are investigated by experimental testing and numerical analysis. Meanwhile, the theoretical models of mean crushing force and specific energy absorption of the hybrid structures are developed by simplified super folding element (SSFE) theory. It is found from the sensitivity analysis of parameters that the dimension of the external tube (D) and the wall thickness (T) of the structure have significant effects on energy absorption. Furthermore, the multi-objective optimization including multiple surrogate models is performed to obtain optimal crashworthiness of the hybrid multi-cell structures. The results show that multiple surrogate models are more favorable and accurate for the crashworthiness design, and the hybrid multi-cell structure with the outer circle and inner square section (CS2) has the best crashworthiness performance. Finally, the multi-objective optimization solutions are analyzed and chosen by the normal boundary intersection (NBI) method to carry out the crashworthiness comparison with the typical multi-cell structures of the same mass, and the hybrid structure (CS2) outperforms multi-cell tubes with the single circular or square section.

AB  - A Performance Measurement System of any Food Supply Chain (FSC) consists of a complex array of performance criteria and their indicators which seems interdependent. There is a need to evaluate the performance of FSC with the help of important criteria and associated key indicators. In this study, we have identified the six important performance criteria and their key indicators using the integrated approach of literature review & expert opinions. Further, we have employed the approach of fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to corroborate the interrelationships among the identified performance criteria and their associated indicators. Study undertakes prioritisation of performance measures or criteria of FSC with the help of an upcoming concept of hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique. The study further utilises the performance indicators of FSC which are comprehensive and reflects the significant characteristics. Results identify three highly essential performance criteria (i.e., ”service to the customer” ”quality” and ”supply chain efficiency”) with top five important key indicators as ”customer satisfaction”, ”customer complaint”, ”on time delivery”, ”reverse logistics” and ”process quality”. Finding suggests towards proper coordination & collaboration among the partners within the framework of an FSC. The study considers, “Information sharing” as an essential factor for improving the coordination and collaboration in the supply chain. A significant limitation of this research is the subjective inputs of experts who belong to demography.

The recent literature shows huge interest in hybrid artificial intelligence (AI)-based models for solving supplier selection problem. In this paper, to solve a multi-criteria supplier selection problem, based on genetic algorithm (GA) and ant colony optimization (ACO), hybrid algorithm of GA and ACO is developed. It combines merits of GA with great global converging rate and ACO with parallelism and effective feedback. A numerical experiment was conducted to optimize parameters and to analyze and compare the performance of the original and hybrid algorithms. Results demonstrate the quality and efficiency improvement of new integrated algorithm, verifying its feasibility and effectiveness. It is an innovative pilot research to leverage hybrid AI-based algorithm of GA and ACO to settle the supplier selection problem, which not only makes a clear methodological contribution for optimization algorithm research, but also can be served as a decision tool and provide management reference for companies.

AB  - In cyber crimes, attackers are becoming more inventive with their exploits and use more sophisticated techniques to bypass the deployed security system. These attacks are targeted and are commonly referred as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). The currently available techniques to tackle these attacks are mostly reactive and signature based. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), a proactive approach is the best solution. However, the major problem with SIEM is tackling huge amount of data in real time that makes it a time consuming and tedious task for security analyst. The use of threat intelligence caters to such issue by prioritizing the level of threat. In this paper, we assign risk score and confidence value to each feed generated at our product “T-Eye platform”. On the basis of these values, we assign a severity score to each feed type. Severity score assigns a level to the threat means prioritize the threat. The results, we achieved for prioritizing the threat is more apparent and accurate. In addition, we optimize the rules of IBM-Q-Radar by using threat feeds generated at T-Eye platform. Furthermore, a huge amount of false positive alarms generated at IBM Q-Radar is reduced to a certain extent.

AB  - The combined thermal protection system has led the drag and heat reduction of hypersonic reentry vehicles to a new developing direction. In order to obtain better resistance to aerodynamic drag and heat while maintain the work stability of the aircraft at the same time, the optimization design of the combined thermal protection system is indispensable. In this paper, a CFD numerical simulation method is combined with a surrogate model based multi-objective optimization algorithm to optimize the configuration of a combinatorial spike and opposing jet thermal protection system in a hypersonic flow with the freestream Mach number of 5.75. The obtained results show that when the total drag coefficient (Cd) and the heat fluxes on the head of the blunt body (Q) are the objective functions, the diameter ratio of the aerodisk to the blunt body bottom (d/D) has no significant effect on the drag and heat flux reduction, and it can be neglected in the optimization process. While the objective functions Cd and Q are affected by the three variables the length-to-diameter ratio of the aerospike (L/D), the jet pressure ratio (PR), and the nozzle radius (r0) in similar ways. Therefore, in this case, the optimization problem can be transformed into a single-objective optimization problem. The quadratic response surface model established by sample points obtained by the orthogonal experimental design method is of high simulation accuracy, with the determination coefficients of Cd and Q are 0.964 and 0.965 respectively, and there is only a difference of −6.96% in the objective function Cd, −0.93% in Q between the optimization results and the CFD results. The combined thermal protection system has better performance in both drag and heat reduction than the single spike or opposing jet systems. Compared with the pure blunt body, the total drag coefficient and heat flux on the head of the blunt body with the combined thermal protection system have significantly decreased, with the Cd goes down 86.66%, and the wall heat flux Q drops off 96.37%.

AB  - Introduction
With the development of industries and increased diversity of their associated hazards, the importance of identifying these hazards and controlling the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) risks has also dramatically augmented. Currently, there is a serious need for a risk management system to identify and prioritize risks with the aim of providing corrective/preventive measures to minimize the negative consequences of OHS risks. In fact, this system can help the protection of employees’ health and reduction of organizational costs. Method: The present study proposes a hybrid decision-making approach based on the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM), and Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) for assessing and prioritizing OHS risks. After identifying the risks and determining the values of the risk assessment criteria via the FMEA technique, the attempt is made to determine the weights of criteria based on their causal relationships through FCM and the hybrid learning algorithm. Then, the risk prioritization is carried out using the MOORA method based on the decision matrix (the output of the FMEA) and the weights of the criteria (the output of the FCM). Results: The results from the implementation of the proposed approach in a manufacturing company reveal that the score at issue can overcome some of the drawbacks of the traditional Risk Priority Number(RPN) in the conventional FMEA, including lack of assignment the different relative importance to the assessment criteria, inability to take into account other important management criteria, lack of consideration of causal relationships among criteria, and high dependence of the prioritization on the experts’ opinions, which finally provides a full and distinct risk prioritization.

AB  - Appropriate selection of gridded precipitation data is very important for the region where long-term precipitation observations are not available. An approach based on compromise programing (CP) is proposed to select the gridded precipitation data for Iraq, where precipitation gauges are very sparse. The performance of seven widely used gauge-based, reanalysis and remote sensing-based gridded monthly precipitation data were assessed using observed precipitation records of 41 stations located within and surrounding Iraq. Obtained results showed the superiority of different datasets in term of different statistical metrics, namely percentage of bias, normalized root-mean-square error, Nash-Sutcliff efficiency, modified index of agreement, volumetric efficiency, and skill score. However, combining all the indices using CP, the gauge-based Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) precipitation data was found best in term of replicating observed precipitation at 21 out of 41 stations. Validation of results using different approaches revealed that the GPCC precipitation was able to replicate annual and seasonal mean and variability and probability distribution of observed precipitation. The study concludes that CP can be used to select appropriate gridded precipitation data by avoiding confusion arise from contradictory results obtained using different statistical metrics.

AB  - In today’s industrial environment, where concepts of smart factories are consolidating their application in companies, it is still necessary to approach management decision making from a perspective that encompasses all aspects of sustainability without losing sight of the social return to which they must contribute. In order to obtain a reliable prediction, of the operation of a Sustainable Manufacturing System (SMS) and its Social Return (SR), this paper develops a methodology and procedures that allow predicting the system performance as a whole. This will allow us to assist management decision making in industries 4.0, supported by multi-criteria methods in knowledge management, simulation, value analysis and operational research by means of: a) Study the economic, social and environmental impacts in the organization and management of the efficient operation of an SMS with the selection of strategies and alternatives in production chains to minimize and / or mitigate environmental and labor risks. b) Encourage of industrial symbiosis or eco-industries networks that create opportunities increasing eco-efficiency and the positive social return of production systems. This proposed methodology will facilitate changes in the structure of production systems in order to implement industry 4.0 paradigms through facilitator technologies such as simulation and virtual reality. This framework will allow Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and other companies to address the decision-making activities that improve the economic-functional efficiency, which will lead to reduce the environmental impact and increase the positive social return of certain production strategies, considering working conditions. The proposed approach went validated, in the area of the Euroregion Galicia North of Portugal, to favour the implementation of the decision-making through the Industry 4.0 Technologies.

AB  - Several areas of Iran are prone to numerous natural hazards. An effective multi-hazard risk reduction requires analysis of the individual hazards and their interplay. This research develops a multi-hazard probability map for three hazards (i.e. landslides, floods, and earthquakes) for the management of hazard-prone areas in Lorestan Province, Iran, using anew ensemble model named SWARA-ANFIS-GWO. First, based on flood and landslide occurrence maps, hazard-prone areas were identified and sub-divided into two subsets.70% of these locations were randomly chosen to be used for the construction of susceptibility maps, while the remaining 30% of the instances were used to assess the accuracy of the models. Then, eleven factors relating to terrain and land use were selected for the preparation of landslide and flood susceptibility maps. An earthquake map was prepared based on a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA). The SWARA method was implemented for weighting contributing factors and evaluating spatial relationships between the three hazards and predisposing factors. Subsequently, the ANFIS approach was used to acquire weights for each value while using a gray Wolf metaheuristic algorithm. Finally, all weight values were further assessed using the MATLAB software. The predicated results from the models were validated with ROC (rate of change) curves. The resulting AUCs (area under the curve) of the validation data indicated accuracies of 84% and 80% for floods and landslides, respectively, and 87% and 82.6%for flood and landslides based on the training data, respectively. Finally, the flood, landslide, and earthquake maps were combined to create a multi-hazard probability map of the Lorestan Province. This multi-hazard map serves as a valuable tool for land use planning and sustainable infrastructure development for the Lorestan Province.

AB  - This paper deals with the stochastic sensitivity analysis of functionally graded material (FGM) plates subjected to free vibration and low-velocity impact to identify the most influential parameters in the respective analyses. A hybrid moment-independent sensitivity analysis is proposed coupled with the least angle regression based adaptive sparse polynomial chaos expansion. Here the surrogate model is integrated in the sensitivity analysis framework to achieve computational efficiency. The current paper is concentrated on the relative sensitivity of material properties in the free vibration (first three natural frequencies) and low-velocity impact responses of FGM plates. Typical functionally graded materials are made of two different components, where a continuous and inhomogeneous mixture of these materials is distributed across the thickness of the plate based on certain distribution laws. Thus, besides the overall sensitivity analysis of the material properties, a unique spatial sensitivity analysis is also presented here along the thickness of the plate to provide a comprehensive view. The results presented in this paper would help to identify the most important material properties along with their depth-wise spatial sensitivity for low-frequency vibration and low-velocity impact analysis of FGM plates. This is the first attempt to carry out an efficient adaptive sparse PCE based moment-independent sensitivity analysis (depth-wise and collectively) of FGM plates under the simultaneous susceptibility of vibration and impact. Such simultaneous multi-objective sensitivity analysis can identify the important system parameters and their relative degree of importance in advanced multi-functional structural systems.

AB  - The management of solid waste and its impact on the environment has been a subject of study and revision in different aspects, from mathematical modeling to control, with the aim of proposing different alternatives that contribute to diminishing the adverse effects in the environment. In this regard, reverse logistics has become a key trend to balance economic development with environmental protection, as this approach allows the maximization of value and the sustainable use of products at the end of their life cycle. This approach has been applied in different sectors such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, food, among others, but still with great potential for study in the plastic industry given the impact of plastic products on the environment and the increasing pressures of consumers, government and environmental groups that propose new forms of operation and innovation in companies in the sector. The goal of this work is the identification of good practices and trends in the plastic products manufacturing industry, with respect to the recovery of plastic products through reverse logistics, both at the revision level of literature, as well as, from the use of an evaluation instrument among entrepreneurs of the sector, in order to provide a framework for diagnosis and continuous improvement in the development of good practices in reverse logistics for the industry.

AB  - The concept of the global supply chain is built upon the mindset of competitive advantages, and it results in several benefits to the manufacturing process, such as increasing flexibility and operational cost-down. Nevertheless, there are still plenty of risks differing among different regions or nations under a global supply chain, and this increases the uncertainty of the supply chain and the possibility of disruption. This paper tackles this issue through a text-mining based global supply chain regional risk identification framework that analyzes literature to identify potential regionalglobal supply chain risks in a supplier region selection process. Text mining was implemented to collect and analyze the existing previous studies related to regional-related global supply chain risks. The results of text mining are represented in a document-term matrix that can further calculate the term-frequency (TF) and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) for the correlation analysis of terms related to supply chain risks. Those indicators provided information about whether the term-related content is vital in the studied literature, and further identified potential regional risk factors. A total of eight regional risk factors were extracted and organized. The proposed framework can objectively analyze geographical differences and provide enterprises with a global supply chain with intuitive guidance on region selection.

KW  - Operational risk
KW  - project-based organizations
KW  - project portfolio risk categorization
AB  - Project-based organizations have their processes based on project, program and portfolio approach, they work within a multi-project environment and their core activities are carried out through project execution under an integrated organizational project management. Therefore, operational risks in project-based organizations are directly related to the project risk management. Thus, in project-based organizations risk management is not only about project risk management, because literature also shows that risk management applied to each project in an isolated way is not enough for systemic risk management in project portfolio and organizational context. This paper, based on a systematic literature review on project portfolio risk management, identifies project portfolio risk categories proposed in previous studies, and proposes and describes four categories associated to operational risk in project portfolio context: project portfolio management level, environmental conditions, project interactions and internal processes. The categories proposed for operational risk in project-based organizations under project portfolio approach are oriented to risk management focused not on the operational risk of each isolated project, but on the project portfolio management. The results can be considered a partial contribution towards building conceptual elements to support project portfolio management process.

AB  - Termite mounds are traditionally presumed to be good indicators of groundwater in places they inhabit but this hypothesis is yet to be scientifically substantiated. To confirm this assertion, it is expected that termite mounds would have strong correlations with groundwater conditioning parameters (GCPs). In this study, termite mounds distribution covering an area of about 156 km2 were mapped and their structural characteristics documented with the aim of examining their relationships with twelve (12) chosen GCPs. Other specific objectives were to identify specific mound types with affinity to groundwater and to produce a groundwater potential map of the study area. To achieve this, 12 GCPs including geology, drainage density, lineament density, lineament intersection density, land use/land cover, topographic wetness index (TWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), slope, elevation, plan curvature, static water level and groundwater level fluctuation were extracted from relevant sources. Frequency ratio (FR) and Spearman’s rank correlation were used to find relationships and direction of such relationships. The result revealed a consistent agreement between FR and Spearman’s rank correlation that tall (≥1.8 m) and Cathedral designed mounds are good indicators of groundwater. Further, the groundwater potential map produced from the Random Forest (RF) model via Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) using best-first algorithm depicted an erratic nature of groundwater distribution in the study area. This was then classified using natural break into very-high, high, moderate, low and very low potential classes and area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) showed an 86.5% validity of the model. About 75% of mapped termite mounds fell within the very-high to moderate potential classes thereby suggesting that although tall and cathedral mounds in particular showed good correlations with a number of GCPs, high mound density in a locality is also an indication of good groundwater potential.

AB  - Concern for the sustainability of the rural tobacco sector is growing, and the joint efforts of societies, organizations, and governments need to be able to deal with the issue and evaluate outcomes and impacts. Sustainability Indicators have been used by the tobacco industry for years to assess initiatives and facilitate activities that encompass social, environmental, and economic factors that correspond to the Triple Bottom Line. However, Sustainability Reports do not clarify the focus of the Sustainability Indicators. Thus, the objective of this study is to analyze the Sustainability Indicators published in the Sustainability Reports of tobacco processing multinational companies in Southern Brazil, verify if they correspond to the Triple Bottom Line standards, and evaluate the focus of these indicators. A survey was conducted with 67 people from the following areas: tobacco production, suppliers of inputs, government, unions, and tobacco companies. Their answers were analyzed using the Multi-Attribute Utility Theory. The results show a considerable imbalance between the indicators that constitute the Triple Bottom Line. While there is great concern for tobacco users and the image of tobacco companies in the eyes of society, there seems to be no concern for producers and the impact of the end of the tobacco culture. This raises questions about the legitimacy of these indicators, especially when the manner in which they are reported to society is taken into account.

AB  - Cities are expected to grow further, and energy communities are one promising approach to promote distributed energy resources and implement energy efficiency measures. To understand the motivation of those communities, this work improves two existing open source models with a Pareto Optimization and two objectives: costs and carbon emissions. Clustering algorithms support the improvement of the models' scalability and performance. The methods developed in this work gives stakeholders the tool to calculate the capabilities and restrictions of the local energy system. The models are applied to a case study using data from an Austrian city, Linz. Four scenarios help to understand aspects of the energy community, such as the lock-in effect of existing infrastructure and future developments. The results show that it is possible to reduce both objectives, but the solutions for minimum costs and minimum carbon emissions are contrary to each other. This work quantifies the highest effect of emission reduction by the electrification of the system. It may be concluded, that a steady transformation of the local energy systems is necessary to reach economically sustainable goals.

AB  - The objective of this study is to explore the determinants of efficiency in industrial scale co-digestion facilities. The methodology applied to finding these determinants involved a two-stage process. First, data envelopment analysis was applied to input-output data from 386 operational anaerobic digestion facilities across Germany and the USA to compute project efficiency scores. These efficiency scores were converted into a binary target variable based on the 75th percentile threshold of efficiency scores. Secondly, a tuned and cross-validated stochastic gradient boosted classification model was built to determine the effect of technical parameters on a project meeting this threshold or not. The results were as follows. Firstly, 75th percentile technical efficiencies for German and US projects were 0.82 and 0.46 respectively. Secondly, the stochastic gradient boosting model had classification accuracies of 0.77 and 0.75 for German and US projects respectively, indicating high suitability for isolating determinants of efficiency. Thirdly, the most influential features included pre-treatment stages and pre-treatment types, digester technology type, and the presence/absence of co-digestion, indicating that decision makers should focus on these technologies. This research has important implications for industrial-scale biogas facilities seeking to enhance operational efficiency and policymakers engaged in technology promotion related to anaerobic digestion.

However, there is a lack of well-defined methodology for pilot line scale-up. To better support this transition, Virtual Models can be integrated with Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) models for potential production-line configurations. However, the validation of the developed models is hardly possible due to the absence of a physical counterpart. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework to increase the accuracy of the DES scale-up models with Virtual Modelling tools and Ontology. Subsequently, a test-case is used to explain the concept.

AB  - The rockburst is a severe underground geological disaster, which has great damage to the workers, equipments and engineering structures. This paper aims to find a suitable way to assess the risk of rockburst within complicated decision making circumstances. First, plenty of literature related to the risk assessment indexes and methods of rockburst is reviewed. On account of the specific characteristics of rockburst, both quantitative and qualitative evaluation indexes are recognized in this paper. Owing to the fuzziness of human thinking and the complexity of risk assessment problems, triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) are advised to describe these indexes values. Meanwhile, the superiority linguistic ratings of decision makers (DMs) are used to determine the weights of indexes. After that, an extended multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method corresponding to TFNs is put forward to obtain the ranking results and specific risk levels of rockburst under fuzzy environment. Finally, an example of assessing the risk of rockburst in Kaiyang phosphate mine is illustrated. The rockburst proneness of four crucial areas is evaluated with the proposed method, and the ranking result is consistent with the field status. Besides, the effectiveness of this method is demonstrated with parameter and comparison analyses. The results show that the extended MABAC method is reliable and effective for evaluating the risk of rockburst, and provides references for the prevention and management of rockburst.

AB  - Evaluation and analysis in health care is a complex task that may involve handling uncertainties and trade-offs between multiple, often conflicting criteria. In the present paper, a multi-criteria weighting approach is proposed for evaluation and analysis of Quality of Life (QoL) criteria. Based on the evaluations of a group of experts and using a Rough Analytical Hierarchy Process (RAHP) weighting method, the QoL criteria weights are determined. The expert evaluation’s uncertainty is modeled with the rough sets theory. The proposed approach is validated by a case study that performs an analysis of WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire criteria. In the case study, weights are calculated for physical health, psychological, social relations and environment criteria. A comparison between the RAHP weights obtained and the AHP weights is achieved. The result of the analysis shows that the order of importance of criteria from the most important to the least important is the following: physical health, psychological, social relations and environment.

AB  - Sustainable supplier selections have been improved by an increased number of multi criteria group decision making (MCGDM) methods and techniques. This paper provides a multi criteria group decision making (MCGDM) proposed technique of the ANP (analytical network process) method and the VIKOR (ViseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) method under neutrosophic environment for dealing with incomplete information and high order imprecision. This is done by using of the triangular neutrosophic numbers (TriNs) to present the linguistic variables based on opinions of experts and decision makers. The aim is to solve the problem of supplier selection in sustainable supplier chain management (SSCM). The suggested technique consists of two phases. First, we use the ANP method to calculate the weights of criteria and sub criteria. Second, with the aid of VIKOR method and with obtained weights of the criteria and sub criteria from step one, we can find the solution. A case study is used to present the decision process in detail. Our proposed method is compared directly with the entropy method to justify our approach. We also use genetic algorithm to compute predicted values for five selected cities while varying economic, environmental and social criteria. Explanations of forecasted outputs and limitation for research have been presented. Our objective is to demonstrate that our proposal can calculate key measurement for major import and export cities, as well as to provide fair and reliable forecasted outcomes.

AB  - Battery electric buses (BEBs) are expected to play a vital role in a green transportation system for China. The Chinese government has dedicated substantial effort and resources to the mass penetration of BEBs, especially in the form of its large amount national fiscal subsidy. Under multiple incentive-based policies, the penetration of BEBs has increased rapidly to make China now rank first among the world's BEB markets. There are a number of unique characteristics in China's BEB industry, including complex product composition, unique technical features, strong policy sensitivity, and effective implementation of government policies. This study focuses on the interaction of these factors among market, technological improvements, and fiscal improvements. The research performed based on an analysis of a large number of actual BEB models and their operational data. More specifically, we analyzed the distribution characteristics of curb mass, top speed, driving power, all-electric range, and energy consumption. Additionally, we examined a technological roadmap for traction batteries and motors of different sizes of BEBs. Finally, the input and output of subsidy benefits associated with fossil oil replacement are examined, which indicate light-duty BEBs exhibit poor performance compared to heavy-duty models. All these results can be used to improve the new incentive polices for BEBs.

AB  - Nowadays, organisations need to be socially responsible by assessing their social impacts and/or performances and those of their supply chain actors in order to achieve competitive advantages. In this perspective, they should be aware of the different available methods and tools that can be used to take socially responsible decisions. The aim of this study is to provide a useful toolbox within Supply Chain Management in order to help decision makers to assess systematically the social sustainability of organisations. For this reason, an analysis of existing methods and tools was performed by following the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines” (PRISMA). A combination of the emerged methods and tools within the SCM is desirable in order to obtain a common vision amongst the social sustainability actors of the organisation and its supply chain. Furthermore, the results draw attention to the need for further development towards social assessment approaches in terms of Life Cycle Thinking.

AB  - Intensive research using chemical stabilization for improving subgrade soil has become increasingly popular around the globe. The alkaline activator additive provides an improved and effective alternative for cement, and also produces comparatively less CO2 emissions. This paper studied the factors that contribute to the strength development of silty sand, a typical subgrade soil in Kamloops, British Columbia (BC), Canada, by mixing different percentages of MgCl2 with alkaline activator (Na2SiO3/NaOH). A total of 64 samples, including the untreated sample, were tested using standard compaction tests and the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test under curing periods of 7, 14, 28, and 60 days. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) full factorial design was used to analyse the UCS results for determining the optimum design of the experiment. A significant compressive strength improvement on the treated soil sample was found using the proposed additive. The combination Na2SiO3/NaOH (0.5) ratio, alkaline activator-to-MgCl2 (0.7) ratio, and 3%, of MgCl2 percentage by dry weight of the soil was selected as the optimum additive design to improve the silty sand found in subgrades in Kamloops, BC.

AB  - An aero-mechanical multidisciplinary optimization was carried out for a high-speed centrifugal impeller, SRV2-O, by integrating a Self-adaptive Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (SMODE) algorithm, RANS solver technique, Finite Element Method (FEM), and data mining technique of analysis of variance (ANOVA). Specifically, the optimization of the impeller was conducted for the maximization of isentropic efficiency and the minimization of maximum stress. During optimization, constraints were imposed on the total pressure ratio at the optimization point and the mass flow rate at the choked point as well. Where, the former constraint intends to guarantee the working capability of the impeller while the latter tries to fix the working range. After optimization, six optimal Pareto solutions are finally obtained. The isentropic efficiency of the optimal solutions is increased by 2.07% at most while the maximum stress is decreased by 6.36% at most among the Pareto solutions. The better performance of optimal designs was demonstrated through detailed aerodynamic and mechanical analysis. Then, the ANOVA is used to explore the effects of variables on performance function in design space, it is found that, the design variables located at the meridian channel and the leading edge of the full blade have significant effect on aerodynamic performance. These variables are crucial to reduce the loss caused by shock wave at impeller inlet and the leakage flow at blade tip. Meanwhile, the design variables located near the leading edge of full blade root section have great effect on strength performance, as they are effective to decrease the bend of blades and thus reduce the maximum stress. Thereby, the better aeromechanical performance can be achieved by dedicated adjustment on the curves of both the shroud of meridional channel and leading edge of full blade. The results of ANOVA are consistent with the aero-mechanical analysis. Therefore, the effectiveness of aero-mechanical optimization and data mining framework is demonstrated.

AB  - Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) have led to innovative transformations in the transportation sector through convergence among automotive, intelligence, and information technologies. Given the fast pace of technological evolution, the technological development of CAVs is being intensively promoted by suppliers, including automakers and IT companies. Some studies have recently investigated the social and market acceptability of CAVs from the individual perspective. However, to our knowledge, none or few studies have focused on comparing the relative importance of value attributes that are likely to have a significant influence on market success in terms of both demand and supply. To bridge this research gap, we identify the perception differences in benefits and concerns of 98 individuals on the demand side and 46 experts on the supplier side using the analytic hierarchy process. The results revealed safety attributes as the most important benefit and concern in common. However, individuals rated driving and parking convenience, and financial burden more importantly, while experts gave higher priority to social advantages and social challenges.

AB  - The human dimension plays an essential role in the energy performance of buildings and is considered as significant as technological advances. Several studies highlighted the negative influence of occupant behaviour in underperforming buildings, while some support that technological innovations may reduce human-related uncertainties. Thus, one may consider that fully automated smart buildings are essential to achieve energy efficiency. However, if technology excludes people from decision-making processes, low acceptance and comfort/welfare levels may be reported from users. Therefore, the right combination of humans and technologies are expected to solve these problems. Buildings are emerging as complex Cyber-Physical Systems, including the Social dimension, and this provides an excellent opportunity to achieve high-performance outcomes, considering both technical and social aspects. Thus, the right choice among available up-to-date behavioural sensing – comprising active and passive sensors, as well as Kinect technology – are important in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era. IoT-driven buildings can use real-time monitoring data to inform users and drive behavioural-based consumption change, which is an important aspect to achieve high-performance buildings and deliver user-centred services. An essential feature in this regard is to allow for human-in-the-loop approaches enabled by human-centric computing and smart devices, which has grown fast in the last few years. This literature review summarises applications and main challenges related to the combination of the human dimension and technological innovations in the building sector. This combination is expected to increase user welfare and reduce the energy consumption in buildings, as human and machine components of intelligence may complement each other regarding building performance.

KW  - Data mining

AB  - At present, most hull-form optimisation methods adopt some optimisation algorithms to search the design space to obtain an optimal solution. These optimisation methods ignore the implicit relationship between optimisation variables and objective functions, which often leads to low efficiency and difficulty in obtaining a global optimal solution. If we can learn in advance the relevant design knowledge of a design space, we can effectively determine the ship-form optimisation and save time. This paper proposes a knowledge-extraction method based on two data-mining techniques—partial correlation analysis and self-organising map (SOM). By considering numerical functions and DTMB5415 as the research objectives, knowledge extraction is performed by combining the partial correlation analysis and SOM based on optimisation data. Through a comparative analysis of results, the effectiveness of the data-mining technology is verified, and the obtained knowledge plays an important role in directing the ship-form optimisation.

AB  - Key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to monitor and improve manufacturing performance. A plethora of manufacturing KPIs are currently in use, with others continually being developed to meet organizational needs. However, obtaining the optimum KPI values at different organizational levels is challenging due to complex interactions between manufacturing decisions, variables, and desired targets. A Bayesian network is developed to characterize the interrelationships between manufacturing decisions, variables, and selected KPIs. For an additive manufacturing case, it is shown that the approach enables appropriate value estimation for decisions and variables for achieving desired KPI values and production cost targets in a manufacturing enterprise.

AB  - Data centers are estimated to have the fastest growing carbon footprint from across the whole information and communication technology (ICT) sector. Evaluating the performance of data centers in terms of energy efficiency and sustainability is becoming an increasingly important matter for organizations and governments (e.g., for regulation or reputation purposes). It nonetheless remains difficult to achieve such evaluation, as data centers imply to take into consideration a wide range of dimensions and stakeholders. Even though a wide range of sustainability performance indicators exist in the literature, there is still a lack of frameworks to help data center stakeholders (spanning from data center owners, governmental regulators to engineers/field operators) to evaluate and understand how a data center performs in terms of sustainable development/behavior. Our research work proposes such a framework, whose originality lies in the combination of state-of-the-art sustainability metrics with the biomimicry commandments of eco-mature system, which enables holistic sustainability assessment of data centres. From a theoretical perspective, the proposed model is designed based on a benefit-cost analysis using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique. This approach allows data center stakeholders for specifying their own preferences and/or expertise in the comparison process, whose practicability is demonstrated in this paper considering three data center candidates, which are respectively located in France, Germany and Sweden.

AB  - The present descriptive-analytical study employs a survey research method, documentary technique, and applied-developmental research design to zone the 18 neighborhoods of Sabzevar City in terms of urban poverty indicators. Data collection was done through a questionnaire distributed among a sample with the size of 384 participants selected from for citizens of 18 neighborhoods of Sabzevar City. A total of 17 urban poverty indicators were surveyed in the form of three sociocultural, economic, and access to urban services indicators. For data analysis, the analytic network process (ANP), Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), and spatial statistics tests were used. The results of the integration of the three economic, sociocultural, and access to urban services indicators depict that the highest urban poverty is in neighborhoods 17 and 18, 6, 14, 15, 13, 12, 11, and 9 respectively. All these neighborhoods are among the marginal neighborhoods of the city. The lowest urban poverty levels are in neighborhoods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and partly in neighborhoods 13, 14 and 16, which are part of the city's central neighborhoods, mostly including government employees, the salaried, and those with high-paying jobs. Comparing different types of urban textures via the Integrated Zoning Map of Poverty in Sabzevar City shows that urban poverty zones correspond to the areas of unofficial settlements and extension villages, and the economic poverty in the southern regions of the city is higher than other urban areas. According to the principles of Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), neighborhoods 1 and 2, which includes Southern Kashifi St., Northern Asrar St., and Imam Khomeini Blvd., is considered to be at a higher level than other areas in terms of poor urban poverty. The results of spatial statistics tests (spatial autocorrelation test and G-test) indicate the correlation and clustering of the data model or urban poverty indicators of the study area.

AB  - Rapid population growth and increased urbanisation have contributed towards increased pressures on global energy, water and food (EWF) resource systems. Therefore, there is an imperative need for resilient and effective resource management that considers societal, environmental and economic components of sustainable development. In this regard, adopting a EWF Nexus approach that considers the interactions between sectors is fundamental. However, it requires the additional mobilisation of particular decision-making tools in order to completely address the question of resource utilisation. In fact, well-studied decision-making methodologies are necessary to sustain resources, address multi-scale challenges and ensure robust governance of EWF Nexus systems. This study highlights the current literature regarding the modelling approaches used for dynamic decision-making within the EWF Nexus focusing on mathematical optimisation, agent-based modelling and game theory. These algorithmic frameworks serve as strategic guidelines for policy makers and encourage effective decision-making related to maximising targets and minimising environmental burdens. Outcomes of this study demonstrate the complementary relationships that exist between the decision-making models highlighted, and how together with a EWF Nexus approach can be used for integrated resource management.

AB  - The development of practical quantum computers that can be used to solve real-world problems is in full swing driven by the ambitious expectation that quantum supremacy will be able to outperform classical super-computers. Like with any emerging compute technology, it needs early adopters in the scientific computing community to identify problems of practical interest that are suitable as proof-of-concept applications and to revise existing solution strategies and develop new ones that exploit the capabilities of the novel compute hardware. In this article we describe a conceptual framework for reducing the computational complexity of simulation-driven automated design optimization processes, which are nowadays widely used in computer-aided product development, by exploiting quantum supremacy. Our approach is based on the assumption that quantum computers will become part of hybrid high-performance computing platforms and can then be used as application-specific accelerator devices.

AB  - Selection of appropriate gridded rainfall and temperature data is a key problem for hydro-climatic studies, particularly in regions where long-term reliable and dense observations are not available. The ability of two intelligent algorithms, symmetrical uncertainty (SU) and random forest (RF), to assess the degree of similarity or the distance between two time series was utilized in this study for the evaluation of gridded climate data. In this study, the performances of seven widely used gridded rainfall datasets and five temperature datasets were evaluated against the available station data in Egypt. Monthly rainfall and mean temperature data recorded at 57 locations for the period 1979–2014 were used for this purpose. The results revealed the better performance of Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) gridded rainfall and University of Delaware (Udel) gridded temperature data in replicating observed rainfall and mean temperature, respectively, in most of the locations in Egypt. Validation of the results using conventional statistical metrics revealed the better performance of different datasets in term of different metrics at different locations. However, the mean values of all the metrics support the results obtained using SU and RF. The study indicates that SU and RF can be used for the selection of appropriate gridded rainfall and temperature data by avoiding confusion arise from contradictory results obtained using various statistical metrics.

AB  - In Internet of Things (IoT), numerous nodes produce huge volumes of data that are the subject of various processing tasks. Tasks execution on top of the collected data can be realized either at the edge of the network or at the Fog/Cloud. Their management at the network edge may limit the required time for concluding responses and return the final outcome/analytics to end-users or applications. IoT nodes, due to their limited computational and resource capabilities, can execute a limited number of tasks over the collected contextual data. A challenging decision is related to which tasks the IoT nodes should execute locally. Each node should carefully select such tasks to maximize the performance based on the current contextual information, e.g., tasks’ characteristics, nodes’ load and energy capacity. In this paper, we propose an intelligent decision making scheme for selecting the tasks that will be locally executed. The remaining tasks will be transferred to peer nodes in the network or the Fog/Cloud. Our focus is to limit the time required for initiating the execution of each task by introducing a two-step decision process. The first step is to decide whether a task can be executed locally; if not, the second step involves the sophisticated selection of the most appropriate peer to allocate it. When, in the entire network, no node is capable of executing the task, it is, then, sent to the Fog/Cloud facing the maximum latency. We comprehensively evaluate the proposed scheme demonstrating its applicability and optimality at the network edge.

AB  - Cloud computing provides computing platforms and facilitates to optimize utilization of infrastructure resources, reduces deployment time and increases flexibility. The popularity of cloud computing led to development of interconnected cloud computing environments (ICCE) such as hybrid cloud, inter-cloud, multi-cloud, and federated cloud, enabling the possibilities to share resources among individual clouds. However, individual proprietary technologies and access interfaces employed by cloud service providers made it difficult to share resources. Interoperability and portability are two of the major challenges to be addressed to ensure seamless access and sharing of resources and services. Many cloud service providers have similar service offerings but different access patterns. It is difficult and time consuming for a cloud user to select an appropriate cloud service as per the application’s requirement. Cloud user has to gather information from various cloud service providers and analyze them. Cloud broker has been proposed to address the challenge of cloud users to get best out of cloud provider. Cloud broker is an entity which works as an independent third party between cloud users and cloud providers. Cloud broker negotiates with several cloud providers as per user’s requirements and tries to select the best services. Cloud broker coordinates the sharing of resources and provides interoperability and portability with other cloud providers. In this paper, a comprehensive survey of cloud brokering in interconnected cloud computing environments has been provided. The need and importance of cloud broker has been discussed. The existing architectures and frameworks of Cloud Brokering are reviewed. A comprehensive literature survey of various Cloud Brokering techniques is presented. A taxonomy of Cloud Brokering techniques has been presented and analyzed on the basis of their strengths and weaknesses/limitations. The taxonomy includes pricing, multi-criteria, quality of services, optimization and trust techniques. The techniques are analyzed on various performance metrics. Research challenges and open problems are identified from reviewed techniques. A model for cloud broker is proposed to address identified challenges. We hope that our work will enable researchers to launch and dive deep into Cloud Brokering challenges in interconnected cloud computing environments.

The Internet of Things consists of several conventional concepts, such as radio frequency identification, near field communication, and sensor networks. However, no research compares these technologies by analyzing massive quantities of papers and patents. Thus, in this study, we explored the research areas of technologies related to the Internet of Things, for which there are opportunities for commercialization in the near future. We also discuss potential applications of these technologies in diverse systems.

AB  - Research on spatial data analysis has developed a number of local indicators of spatial association (LISA), which allow exploration of local patterns in spatial data. These include local Moran’s I and local Geary’s c, as well as Gi and Gi∗ that can be used for continuous or interval variables only. Despite numerous situations where qualitative (nominal/categorical) variables are encountered, few attempts have been devoted to the development of methods to explore the local spatial pattern in categorical data. To our knowledge, there is no indicator of local spatial association that can be used for both continuous and categorical data at the same time. In this paper, we propose a new local indicator of spatial association, called the entropy-based local indicator of spatial association (ELSA), that can be used for both categorical and continuous spatial data. ELSA quantifies the degree of spatial association of a variable at each location relative to the same variable at the neighbouring locations. This indicator simultaneously incorporates both spatial and attribute aspects of spatial association into account. The values of ELSA vary between 0 and 1, which denote highest and lowest spatial association, respectively. We compare ELSA to existing statistics such as Local Moran’s I and test the power and size of the new statistic. We also introduce the ”entrogram”, a novel approach for exploring the global spatial structure within the entire area (like a variogram). This study showed that the ELSA is consistent and robust, and is therefore suitable for applications in a wide range of disciplines. The ELSA algorithm is made available as an R-package (elsa).

AB  - Decision-making support (DMS) methods are widely used for technical, economic, social and environmental assessments within different energy sectors, including upstream oil and gas, refining and distribution, petrochemical, power generation, nuclear power, solar, biofuels, and wind. The main aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive literature review and classification framework for the latest scholarly research on the application of DMS methods in the upstream oil and gas industry. To achieve this aim, a systematic review is conducted on the current state-of-the-art and future perspectives of various DMS methods applied to different upstream operations (such as exploration, development and production) which take place prior to shipping of crude oil and natural gas to the refineries for processing. Journal and conference proceeding sources that contain literature on the subject are identified, and based on a set of inclusion criteria the related papers are selected and reviewed carefully. A framework is then proposed to classify the literature according to the year and source of publications, type of fossil fuel sources, stages of oil and gas field lifecycle, data collection techniques, decision-making methods, and geographical distribution and location of case studies. The proposed literature classification and content analysis can help upstream oil and gas industry stakeholders such as field owners, asset managers, service providers, policy makers, environmentalist, financial analyst, and regulatory agencies to gain better insight about their business activities with well-informed decision-making processes.

AB  - The traditional quality function deployment (QFD) approach deals with the weights of customer requirements (CRs), relationships among CRs and design requirements (DRs), correlation among DRs by using crisp values. This paper uses fuzzy numbers to improve the drawbacks of the traditional QFD method because fuzzy numbers enable to make consistent decisions in uncertain environment to decision makers. The existing papers handle a simple multiplication operation to calculate the correlation among CRs and the correlation among DRs. This study proposes fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) approach to calculate these correlations so that FCM is a successful method to handle the interactions among criteria. This paper contributes to the literature by integrating QFD approach and fuzzy cognitive map approach. The weights of DRs are defined in the result of the proposed QFD approach. These weights are used to evaluate the dishwasher machine alternatives in intuitionistic fuzzy VIKOR method. Intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFS) ensures to handle more information than type-1 fuzzy number to describe the fuzziness and the uncertainty of the real life world. Finally, the proposed approach has been implemented to a dishwasher machine selection in order to test its validity.

The proposed solution algorithm includes two main stages; Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method that is applied to select the most efficient suppliers by considering different performance indicators of company and a mixed-integer linear multi-objective mathematical model that is proposed to optimize the design of the sustainable supply chain in terms of total cost, time and social factors. Mathematical modelling approach and data analysis are presented to help decision makers. Minimization of cost, time; and maximization of sustainability by using augmented ϵ-constraint method are outlined by using proposed model. Pareto solution sets of the multi-objective mathematical programming problem are obtained by using GAMS language and environment. Sensitivity analyses are made to highlight the details of illustrative cases based on real-life data from packaging industry.

AB  - Due to budget constraints of Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and a significant number of deficient bridges around the U.S., there is a need for a systematic approach to more efficiently and optimally allocate limited resources for bridge maintenance efforts. This paper presents a GIS-integrated decision-making framework to prioritize bridge maintenance by using aggregated bridge ratings and average daily traffic (ADT). The aggregated bridge ratings were the weighted average of deck, substructure, superstructure, and scour ratings; the weights were determined by analyzing a group of bridge experts' comparisons of the relative importance of deck, substructure, superstructure, and scour with respect to bridge resiliency, riding comfort, safety, and serviceability using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Then, a geographical information system (GIS) user interface that integrated Google™ Fusion Tables, Google Maps, and the decision-making criteria was created to visualize the priority of the bridges for maintenance. Through a case study and validation with a division bridge engineer at Oklahoma DOT (ODOT), the developed framework was proven to be a robust and reliable approach. This study contributes to industry practice by providing a systematic and implementable approach to facilitate state DOTs' decision-making for bridge maintenance without requiring extra bridge data collection effort.

AB  - The previous research work in the literature for capacity planning and scheduling of biopharmaceutical manufacture focused mostly on the use of mixed integer linear programming (MILP). This paper presents fast genetic algorithm (GA) approaches for solving discrete-time MILP problems of capacity planning and scheduling in the biopharmaceutical industry. The proposed approach is validated on two case studies from the literature and compared with MILP models. In case study 1, a medium-term capacity planning problem of a single-site, multi-suite, multi-product biopharmaceutical manufacture is presented. The GA is shown to achieve the global optimum on average 3.6 times faster than a MILP model. In case study 2, a larger long-term planning problem of multi-site, multi-product bio-manufacture is solved. Using the rolling horizon strategy, the GA is demonstrated to achieve near-optimal solutions (1% away from the global optimum) as fast as a MILP model.

AB  - Explaining outputs determined algorithmically by machines is one of the most pressing and studied problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) nowadays, but the equally pressing problem of using AI to explain outputs determined by humans is less studied. In this paper we advance a novel methodology integrating case-based reasoning and computational argumentation from AI to explain outcomes, determined by humans or by machines, indifferently, for cases characterised by discrete (static) features and/or (dynamic) stages. At the heart of our methodology lies the concept of arbitrated argumentative disputesbetween two fictitious disputants arguing, respectively, for or against a case’s output in need of explanation, and where this case acts as an arbiter. Specifically, in explaining the outcome of a case in question, the disputants put forward as arguments relevant cases favouring their respective positions, with arguments/cases conflicting due to their features, stages and outcomes, and the applicability of arguments/cases arbitrated by the features and stages of the case in question. We in addition use arbitrated dispute trees to identify the excess features that help the winning disputant to win the dispute and thus complement the explanation. We evaluate our novel methodology theoretically, proving desirable properties thereof, and empirically, in the context of primary legislation in the United Kingdom (UK), concerning the passage of Bills that may or may not become laws. High-level factors underpinning a Bill’s passage are its content-agnostic features such as type, number of sponsors, ballot order, as well as the UK Parliament’s rules of conduct. Given high numbers of proposed legislation (hundreds of Bills a year), it is hard even for legal experts to explain on a large scale why certain Bills pass or not. We show how our methodology can address this problem by automatically providing high-level explanations of why Bills pass or not, based on the given Bills and their content-agnostic features.

AB  - This research is presented as a safety analysis of a cognitive architecture with an intelligent decision support model (IDSM) that is embedded into an autonomous non-deterministic safety-critical system. Cognitive technology is currently simulated within safety-critical systems in order to highlight variables of interest, interface with intelligent technologies, and provide an environment that improves the system's cognitive performance. In this research, the safety of the architecture was analyzed on an actual safety-critical system, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The safety analysis was conducted in both a simulated and a real world nautical based environment. The objective was to define the safety design of a cognitive architecture. The input to the safety design was provided through an approach that identified and mitigated hazards associated with a USV controlled by a cognitive architecture. This analysis provided a structured, task-oriented approach for the dissemination of information concerning safety requirements. This approach was necessary to achieve a safe execution of the USV's capabilities through a design that reduces the potential for injury to personnel and damage to equipment. Other real time applications that would benefit from advancing the safety of cognitive technologies are unmanned platforms, transportation technologies, and service robotics. The results will provide cognitive science researchers with a reference for safety engineering of artificially intelligent safety-critical systems.

AB  - In Cloud Computing model, users are charged according to the usage of resources and desired Quality of Service (QoS). Multi-objective task scheduling problem based on desired QoS is an NP-Complete problem. Due to the NP-Complete nature of task scheduling problems and huge search space presented by large scale problem instances, many of the existing solution algorithms cannot effectively obtain global optimum solutions. In this paper, a chaotic symbiotic organisms search (CMSOS) algorithm is proposed to solve multi-objective large scale task scheduling optimization problem on IaaS cloud computing environment. Chaotic optimization strategy is employed to generate initial ecosystem (population), and random sequence based components of the phases of SOS are replaced with chaotic sequence to ensure diversity among organisms for global convergence. In addition, chaotic local search strategy is applied to Pareto Fronts generated by SOS algorithms to avoid entrapment in local optima. The performance of the proposed CMSOS algorithm is evaluated on CloudSim simulator toolkit, using both standard workload traces and synthesized workloads for larger problem instances of up to 5000. Moreover, the performance of the proposed CMSOS algorithm was found to be competitive with the existing with the existing multi-objective task scheduling optimization algorithms. The CMSOS algorithm obtained significant improved optimal trade-offs between execution time (makespan) and financial cost (cost) with no computational overhead. Therefore, the proposed algorithms have potentials to improve the performance of QoS delivery.

To fill up the gap, this study aims to formulate an evaluation and selection framework for of SMS configurations. To do so, this paper reviews existing SMS configuration assessment framework, simulation models, and evaluation and selection criteria and Subsequently identifies the framework phases and the model of each phase.

AB  - Inconel-718 is a nickel-based super-alloy which is extensively used in various modern manufacturing industries like chemical, aerospace, nuclear, marine, automobile and medical due to its excellent mechanical behavior. The conventional cutting method faces some problems for the cutting of these materials due to better mechanical properties. The unconventional cutting methods may be alternative methods for the cutting of these difficult-to-cut materials. Among the different unconventional methods, the laser cutting may be applied with satisfactorily quality by operating the machine at optimum settings. The laser beam cutting process is one of the most suitable unconventional cutting processes to achieve the geometrical accuracy with high precision at the optimum parameter level. The main aim of this experimental work is to optimize the different quality characteristics viz. top kerf deviation (TKD) and bottom kerf deviation (BKD), during the pulsed Nd: YAG laser cutting of Inconel-718 sheet by using the hybrid approach methodology regression based genetic algorithm. The design of experiment based L27 orthogonal array has been applied for performing the experiments. By using the experimental data, second order regression models for all quality characteristics have been developed. The hybrid optimization technique regression based genetic algorithm has been used for optimizing the quality characteristics. The optimum results found by proposed methodology have been compared experimentally. The comparison of optimized results with the experimental results shows that considerable improvements have been observed in all quality characteristics individually as well as simultaneously.

The findings revealed that; (i) the efficiency results for banking activity vary for competitiveness and for the adoption of new technologies before and after the financial recession; (ii) the majority of deposit banks operating primarily with non-interest based factors found to be less-efficient; (iii) the ownership and capital structure of banks do not significantly contribute to their banking performance, as they were technically inefficient during the same period; and (iv) the inputs of the banking activities could be reduced while a constant level of output is maintained by adopting and properly using the most efficient technology to boost the technical efficiency.

Although ensemble forecasts are increasingly employed for flood forecasting, developing a flood warning system based on ensemble forecasts has not been adequately addressed yet. In this study, first a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to forecast the heavy precipitation in Kan Basin, Iran. Ensemble storms were forecasted using five cumulus schemes including Kain-Fritsch, Betts-Miller-Janjic, Grell 3D ensemble, Multi-scale Kain-Fritsch and Grell-Devenyi ensemble cumulus scheme. Then, a Bayesian Networks (BN) was developed to estimate the flood peak using the atmospheric ensemble forecasts. Finally, a Fuzzy-TOPSIS (The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) model was prepared for making decisions for flood warning scenarios considering all effective factors in flood warning and uncertainty associated with them. Assessment of the proposed flood warning system was examined for various scenarios. It showed that when a significantly high probability was assigned to a warning level, that level had the maximum closeness coefficient and consequently chosen as a warning level. Yet, if the probability was distributed equally between some warning levels, the flood warning system acts cautiously since the decision-making model allocated the highest rank to the stronger warning level. Regarding the reasonable results of this study, applying the Fuzzy-TOPSIS model to develop a flood warning system based on atmospheric ensemble forecasts is recommended to apply in similar catchments for addressing the uncertainties.

AB  - Multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) is a classic combinatorial optimization problem arising from many practical applications. To be closer to real-life applications, this paper focuses on a special kind of multi-objective MKP (MOMKP), where the optimization objectives are to maximize the total profit and minimize the maximum consumption of multidimensional resources. To solve it, a Pareto evolutionary algorithm based on Incremental Learning (PEAIL) is proposed, whose components mainly consist of two parts, i.e., the online Incremental Learning and the nondominated sorting. PEAIL is unique in that it can extract the historical information of the search behavior and then feed them back to the main evolutionary framework. Firstly, problem-dependent heuristics, including genetic operators and a repair mechanism for infeasible solutions, are proposed and discussed. Secondly, an online Incremental Learning approach is put forward to learn the probability model of excellent solutions during the iteration process. Thereby, we can predict promising individuals from this probability model, which are used for further strengthening PEAIL’s search ability. Thirdly, a simple yet effective competition-based improvement mechanism is proposed to refine the offspring of PEAIL. Finally, results of experiments on 45 benchmark instances and a real-life case study demonstrate the effectiveness and practical values of the proposed PEAIL.

AB  - Ultra reliable life support is needed for environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS) of space stations (SS) because provisioning of spare parts or a speedy crew recovery may not be a feasible option. There is limited work on the reliability modeling and analysis (RMA) of ECLSS of a SS. In addition, presently the literature review on RMA of space stations which is the central theme of the paper is not organized in a formalized manner and the ideas presented are spread out and limited in developing a consolidated literature review in a sequential manner. The paper presents a detailed literature survey on the RMA of SS ECLSS. The paper also highlights the research gaps and an overview of latest RMA models that can be applied for the reliability analysis of SS ECLSS. The paper contributes by providing sufficient insights into the complete development of RMA of the SS ECLSS comprehensively for better understanding of the readers.

AB  - This work introduces and develops the concepts of solar exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental maps for photovoltaic systems. These maps are developed to complement the information provided by solar exergy maps for recognizing the most appropriate sites for hosting photovoltaic power plants. A detailed case study is carried out to demonstrate how the proposed approaches can be practically applied to promote solar photovoltaic systems. More specifically, the exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental performances of a 100 kW grid-connected photovoltaic plant are assessed for several Iranian cities over the year based on actual climatic, economic, and environmental impact data. The spatio-temporal solar maps for unit exergoeconomic cost and unit exergoenvironmental impact of electricity generation are then developed for the investigated climatic conditions for the first time. In order to demonstrate the suitability and reliability of the developed maps, their interoperations are assessed and compared to those for exergy efficiency. The results show that solar exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental maps provide more valuable information on the performance of solar photovoltaic systems than exergy efficiency maps, demonstrating their robustness for optimum site selection and plant sizing. In addition, the exergy efficiency maps may result in inappropriate site selection of photovoltaic solar farms. The central, south, southeast, and some west parts of Iran are the most suitable locations for implementing photovoltaic power fields from exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental viewpoints. The developed approaches can also be used for locating and sizing other renewable energy systems under different climatic conditions.

AB  - In last few decades, circular economy concepts have gained a lot of consideration because of its focus towards sustainability. Reverse logistics play an important role in the adoption and implementation of circular economy concepts in supply chains. It is defined as “sequence of activities required to collect the used product from the customers for their disposition to either reuse or repair or re-manufacture or recycle or dispose of it”. Disposition is one of the crucial decisions which may greatly affect the reverse logistics performance from sustainability perspective. It also plays an important role in improving the operational efficiency of the reverse logistics. The objective of this study is to explore the reverse logistics in context of Indian electronics industry and examine the effect of disposition decisions on Triple Bottom Line (TBL) i.e. economic, environmental, and social performance of reverse logistics. Hypotheses related to disposition decisions and TBL performance was developed. A survey instrument was prepared and was sent to seven hundred organizations from the Indian electronics sector. Over all 208 responses were found suitable for the research. All the necessary statistical analysis was carried out to ensure the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. Partial least square path modelling technique of structural equation modeling has been used for testing the research hypothesis. Measurement model had shown sufficient data fit for the modelling. Partial least square path modelling results reveal that effectiveness of disposition decisions is positively associated with TBL performance. The article contributes to the few studies available on improving the reverse logistics performance. Findings will be useful for managers in managing reverse logistics in effective manner.

AB  - Energy storage has developed into a key solution to the problem of energy abandonment, which has been paid close attention. In the era of energy sharing, there is a general trend of cooperation between energy storage companies and power suppliers. This paper evaluates energy storage node enterprises to make their alliance more valuable with power generation node enterprises. First, this paper expounds the importance of sustainable energy storing node optimization selection and identifies 23 criteria from the perspective of benefits, opportunities, costs and risks to establish the evaluation index system. Then a hybrid ANP-BOCR -TOPSIS method is proposed to evaluate the index system including determining the integrated criteria weights and ranking four alternatives by TOPSIS method. Next, a case study is used to verify the accuracy and feasibility of the hybrid method. Through the validation with DEMATEL and comparative analysis of three integrated methods, it is concluded that the hybrid ANP-BOCR-TOPSIS method can be applied to the evaluation of clean energy further research. Finally, the suggestions and conclusions are given in the end.

AB  - Additive manufacturing (AM) has risen to be a substantial part of modern manufacturing due to its unique capabilities and has already been fondly adopted in various fields especially in the aerospace. In order to fully harness the benefits of this revolutionary manufacturing technology, this article aims to develop a practical integrated design methodology that can be used to enhance quality and throughput of AM processes. In doing so, investigation were conducted to examine an AM aero-based component through design tools that allow designers to consider an integrated process chain, from component design to pre-processing, manufacturing (laser bed fusion building), post-processing and finished part. The developed design model integrated with decision tools will assist the design experts in developing new knowledge that looks beyond the familiar Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) rather to Design towards product Certification (DoC). In addition, this will serve as an effective design guidance that can inform proper design planning and optimization in aerospace industry production.

AB  - Livestock industries are increasingly embracing precision farming and decision support tools. As a result, sensors, weather stations, individual animal tracking, feed monitoring and other sources create large data volumes, much of which is used only for a single purpose. There are unrealised potential benefits of making on farm data interoperable and accessible and federating it with public data sources. We reviewed recent literature on precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies in relation to the use of public data, open standards and interoperability. Livestock farms produce rising volumes of disparate private datasets, reflecting a variety of information needs and technological opportunities, but typically lacking interoperable formats and metadata. These as well as large amounts of accessible public datasets are currently underutilised in decision support tools. Tools that demonstrate the use of interoperable standards and bring together public and private data for decision support can enhance the value proposition and help lower barriers to the sharing and re-use of data. This review of interoperable standards in extensive livestock farming systems concludes that there is a need for not only a new type of decision support tool, but also a consensus on data exchange standards to prove the value of shared data at farm scale (commercial benefit) and a regional scale (public good).

AB  - Nowadays, the design of smart buildings (micro smart grids) has become one of the major concerns of almost all countries. Relying on clean or renewable energies to power homes, institutions or even factories has become a reality and an inevitable future. However, the distribution of energy stored or obtained must be done in an intelligent way to best serve all the building entities taking into consideration several factors such as: their priorities, nature of activities, the energy required, the duration of daily activity. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the primary components for micro smart grids, indeed thanks to IoT we can not only do the tele-survey of the consumption, but especially back up the reports to a controller entity allowing adapt the energy policy of the entire building. As a result, when we talk about a smart building, we are talking about a distributed sensor architecture. The management of these sensors must be done centrally to facilitate: (1) the prediction of the energy to be demanded, (2) the application of new energy balancing policies, (3) and the promotion of a source of energy compared to another depending on the weather conditions. Software-Defined Network (SDN) is an approach to orchestrate from a central point called a controller a set of nodes or devices present in the network and can be perfectly matched to the points previously discussed. Our contribution is in the context of the micro-smart grid, our paper proposes a new architecture for the efficient management and intelligent distribution of electrical energy obtained from all sources of renewable energy by adopting an SDN approach and by exploiting IoT sensors. The architecture is called Micro Smart Grid by Software-Defined Network (MSGSDN). A new algorithm is modeled and developed allowing this intelligent sharing.
