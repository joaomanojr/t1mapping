AB  - Real-time traffic speed estimation is a fundamental task for urban traffic management centers and is often a critical element of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). For this purpose, various sensors are used to collect traffic information. For many applications, the information provided by individual sensors is incomplete, inaccurate and/or unreliable. Therefore, a fusion based estimate provides a more effective approach towards traffic speed estimation. In this paper, seven multi-sensor data fusion-based estimation techniques are investigated. All methods are implemented and compared in terms of their ability to fuse data from loop detectors and probe vehicles to accurately estimate freeway traffic speed. For the purposes of a rigorous comparison, data are generated from a microsimulation model of a major freeway in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The microsimulation model includes loop detectors and a newly implemented traffic monitoring system that detects Bluetooth-enabled devices traveling past roadside Bluetooth receivers, allowing for an automated method of probe vehicle data collection. To establish the true traffic speed that each fusion method attempts to estimate, all vehicles in the microsimulation model are equipped with GPS devices. Results show that most data fusion techniques improve accuracy over single sensor approaches. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the improvement by data fusion depends on the technique, the number of probe vehicles, and the traffic conditions.

AB  - The progress of business is moving fast and the key to maintain advantage and competitiveness is research and continuous improvement. Besides economic, environment is always more object of evaluation analysis. There are numerous ways to assess individually both economic and environmental aspects, but in order to guarantee a high quality of improvement, an integration of different methods and theories is required. Thus, this research provides an integration of two different approaches: The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The first allows the analyst to understand the environmental issue. The second is useful in order to select the best solution for improvement. The main purpose of this study is to develop a systematic method, easy to use and giving useful results. In the present work existing methods are reviewed and integrated in a new approach proposed to support continuous improvement. A real case in an Italian bearing plant is presented.

AB  - With the increasing deployment of a variety of wireless access networks, wireless devices face the challenge of selecting the most suitable network from a set of available access networks. Some of the weighty issues in 4G wireless networks are fastness and seamlessness in handover process. This paper therefore, proposes a handover technique based on movement prediction in wireless mobile (WiMAX and LTE - Advanced) environment. The technique enables the system to predict signal quality between the mobile User Equipment (UE) and eNodeB stations/access points (APs) in two different networks. Prediction is achieved using dynamic regressive integrated moving average (DRIMA) model by keeping track of the signal strength of mobile users. With the help of the prediction, layer-3 handover activities are able to occur prior to layer-2 handover, and therefore, total handover latency can be reduced. This demonstrates that the proposed method predicts the future signal level accurately and reduces the total handover latency.

AB  - In this work, a group of metallic aluminum foam-cored sandwich panels (AFSPs) were used as vehicle armor against blast loading. The dynamic responses of the AFSPs with various combinations of face-sheet materials were analyzed using LS-DYNA. It was found that the AFSP with an aluminum (AA2024 T3) front face and a Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA) steel back face (labeled T3-AF-RHA) outperformed the other panel configurations in terms of maximum back face deflection (MaxD) and areal specific energy absorption (ASEA). It was also found that boundary conditions and the standoff distance (SoD) between an explosive and a target surface both have a remarkable influence on the blast response of the AFSPs. Using artificial neural network (ANN) approximation models, multi-objective design optimization (MDO) of the T3-AF-RHA panel was performed both with and without variations in blast load intensity. The optimization results show that the two objectives of MaxD minimization and ASEA maximization conflict with each other and that the optimal designs must be identified in a Pareto sense. Moreover, the Pareto curves obtained are different for varied blast impulse levels. Consequently, it is concluded that loading variation should be considered when designing such sandwich armors to achieve more robust blast-resistant performance.

AB  - Nowadays, heating energy demand has become a significant estimator used during the design stage of any new building. In this paper we are proposing a model to predict the heating energy demand, based on the main factors that influence a building's heat consumption. It was found out that these factors are: the building global heat loss coefficient (G), the south equivalent surface (SES) and the difference between the indoor set point temperature and the sol-air temperature. In the second part of this paper, multiple dynamic simulations were carried out in order to determine the values of the inputs and output data of the future prediction model. Using the obtained database, a multiple regression prediction model was further used to develop the prediction model. In the last part of this paper the model results was validated with the measured data from 17 blocks of flats. Moreover, in this article it is also shown the comparison with the results calculated using the building's energy certification methodology. A detailed error analysis showed that the model presents a very good accuracy (correlation coefficient of 0.987). In conclusion, the proposed model presents the following characteristics: three inputs and one output, simplicity, large applicability, good match with the simulations and with the energy certification calculations, human behavior correction.

AB  - Fuzzy linguistic variable has been used extensively in many applications of decision making. However, most of the fuzzy linguistic is defined only on one side which is in positive fuzzy number. This paper aims to propose a new linguistics variable which considers both sides which are positive and negative fuzzy numbers. This new linguistic variable is developed in terms of interval type-2 fuzzy set for solving unknown interval type-2 entropy weight of interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method. Moreover, a modified distance measure is performed in tandem with the new fuzzy linguistic variable. An example is used to illustrate the proposed method. The results show that the new method is almost consistent with the other method thereby would offers a new dimension to type-2 fuzzy group decision-making environment.

By using Facebook as a test platform, the experiment shows that our model outperforms other methodologies and indicates that social relationships play a more important role than the preferences of a user and the popularity of an application.

AB  - In the research for this paper, a GA–PNN hybrid system was used for modelling the convective heat transfer characteristics and pressure drop of TiO2–water a nanofluid in a fully developed turbulent flow based on an experimentally obtained train and test data set. Models were developed for the Nusselt number and the pressure drop of the nanofluid as a function of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, nanofluid volume concentration and average nanoparticle diameter. The results of the proposed models were compared with experimental data and with existing correlations. The validity of the proposed models was benchmarked by using statistical criteria and NSGA-II was used for multi-objective optimisation for the convective heat transfer. In the optimisation procedure model, the Nusselt number and pressure drop were considered as the objective functions. However, when the set of decision variables was selected based on the Pareto set, it ensures the best possible combination of objectives. The Pareto front of multi-objective optimisation of the Nusselt number and pressure drop proposed models were also shown and discussed. It was found that application of the multi-objective optimisation method for the turbulent convective heat transfer characteristics and pressure drop of TiO2–water nanofluid could lead to finding the best design points based on the importance of the objective function in the design procedure.

AB  - Defining a comprehensive conceptual model of the resources sought is one of the most important steps in geothermal potential mapping. In this study, Fry analysis as a spatial distribution method and 5% well existence, distance distribution, weights of evidence (WofE), and evidential belief function (EBFs) methods as spatial association methods were applied comparatively to known geothermal occurrences, and to publicly-available regional-scale geoscience data in Akita and Iwate provinces within the Tohoku volcanic arc, in northern Japan. Fry analysis and rose diagrams revealed similar directional patterns of geothermal wells and volcanoes, NNW-, NNE-, NE-trending faults, hotsprings and fumaroles. Among the spatial association methods, WofE defined a conceptual model correspondent with the real world situations, approved with the aid of expert opinion. The results of the spatial association analyses quantitatively indicated that the known geothermal occurrences are strongly spatially-associated with geological features such as volcanoes, craters, NNW-, NNE-, NE-direction faults and geochemical features such as hotsprings, hydrothermal alteration zones and fumaroles. Geophysical data contains temperature gradients over 100°C/km and heat flow over 100mW/m2. In general, geochemical and geophysical data were better evidence layers than geological data for exploring geothermal resources. The spatial analyses of the case study area suggested that quantitative knowledge from hydrothermal geothermal resources was significantly useful for further exploration and for geothermal potential mapping in the case study region. The results can also be extended to the regions with nearly similar characteristics.

AB  - In this work, treatment of oily wastewaters with commercial polyacrylonitrile (PAN) ultrafiltration (UF) membranes was investigated. In order to do these experiments, the outlet wastewater of the API (American Petroleum Institute) unit of Tehran refinery, is used as the feed. The purpose of this paper was to predict the permeation flux and fouling resistance, by applying artificial neural networks (ANNs), and then to optimize the operating conditions in separation of oil from industrial oily wastewaters, including trans-membrane pressure (TMP), cross-flow velocity (CFV), feed temperature and pH, so that a maximum permeation flux accompanied by a minimum fouling resistance, was acquired by applying genetic algorithm as a powerful soft computing technique. The experimental input data, including TMP, CFV, feed temperature and pH, permeation flux and fouling resistance as outputs, were used to create ANN models. This fact that there is an excellent agreement between the experimental data and the predicted values was shown by the modeling results. Eventually, by multi-objective optimization, using genetic algorithm (GA), an optimization tool was created to predict the optimum operating parameters for desired permeation flux (i.e. maximum flux) and fouling resistance (i.e. minimum fouling) behavior. The accuracy of the model is confirmed by the comparison between the predicted and experimental data.

The scheduling priority is developed by Multi Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis (MOORA) technique under Fuzzy Multi Criteria Decision Making (FMCDM) environment considering several attributes. The well-known Contract Net Protocol (CNP) is followed for the purpose of task allocation by negotiation and cooperation, where message based communication is accomplished by eXtensible markup language (XML) using J2EE. Different Document Type Definitions (DTDs) are developed for intended applications. Necessary modifications in the scheduling arising out of changes in the volume-mix are made by a distributed cooperative problem-solving algorithm to meet the demand without violating the deadline. The algorithm is implemented using HTML code in front-end with Java Server Page (JSP) through Apache Tomcat 6.02 server. It is advocated that the cooperation based teamwork coupled with higher flexibility and agility is the key to success to remain unperturbed and provide reasonably good solution in the face of disturbances and stands superior to its hierarchical counterpart.

AB  - This paper proposes an effective method for fault diagnosis of large-scale power systems based on radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) and fuzzy integral. It aims at effectively diagnosing the tie lines which connect different adjacent sub-networks in the context of divisional fault diagnosis. First, an overlapping network division method is proposed to divide a large-scale power system into a desired number of eligible sub-networks. Then, for each sub-network, a local RBF NN diagnostic module which is constructed by an exhaustive search-assisted forward recursive algorithm is allocated. Finally, a Choquet fuzzy integral fusion module is constructed for any pair of connected sub-networks. When a fault occurs, local RBF NN diagnostic modules will be selectively triggered according to local alarm information. If it involves a tie line, the corresponding Choquet fuzzy integral fusion module will be triggered to fuse the diagnostic outputs derived from the adjacent sub-networks which are connected by the tie line. Case studies with a 14-bus power system are presented to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method under various complex fault scenarios. The diagnostic results demonstrate that this proposed method is efficient in identifying faults within local sub-networks as well as those on the tie lines with strong fault tolerance and high diagnostic accuracy.

Optimal selection of process parameters is highly critical for successful material removal and high dimensional and surface quality for micro-sized die/mold applications. A set of designed experiments is carried out in a pulsed Nd:YAG laser milling system using AISI H13 hardened tool steel as work material. Arrays of micro-channels have been fabricated using a range of process parameters such as scanning speed (SS), pulse intensity (PI), and pulse frequency (PF). The relation between process parameters and quality characteristics has been studied with experimental modeling. Multi-criteria decision making for material and process parameter selection for desired surface quality and dimensional accuracy is investigated using an evolutionary computation method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO).

Against this backdrop, we propose a decision framework that supports the consolidation of existing performance measurement systems such that information processing complexity and costs are balanced with the extent to which decision makers' information requirements are met and alignment with corporate objectives is achieved. We also report on the results of an evaluation based on feature comparison, prototype construction, and a real-world application.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of choosing the most appropriate classification from a given set of classifications of a set of patterns. This is a relevant topic on unsupervised systems and clustering analysis because different classifications can in general be obtained from the same data set. The provided methodology is based on five fuzzy criteria which are aggregated using an Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operator. To this end, a novel multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) system is defined, which assesses the degree up to which each criterion is met by all classifications. The corresponding single evaluations are then proposed to be aggregated into a collective one by means of an OWA operator guided by a fuzzy linguistic quantifier, which is used to implement the concept of fuzzy majority in the selection process. This new methodology is applied to a real marketing case based on a business to business (B2B) environment to help marketing experts during the segmentation process. As a result, a segmentation containing three segments consisting of 35, 98 and 127 points of sale respectively is selected to be the most suitable to endorse marketing strategies of the firm. Finally, an analysis of the managerial implications of the proposed methodology solution is provided.

AB  - In today’s severe competitive environment the selection of appropriate suppliers is a significantly important decision for effective supply chain management. Appropriate suppliers reduce purchasing costs, decrease production lead time, increase customer satisfaction and strengthen corporate competitiveness. In this study a multiple sourcing supplier selection problem is considered as a multi objective linear programming problem. Three objective functions are minimization of costs, maximization of quality and maximization of on-time delivery respectively. In order to solve the problem, a fuzzy mathematical model and a novel solution approach are proposed to satisfy the decision maker’s aspirations for fuzzy goals. The proposed approach can be efficiently used to obtain non-dominated solutions. A numerical example is given to illustrate how the approach is utilized.

AB  - Today's international business environment has forced many firms to focus on supply chain management to gain a competitive advantage. During recent years, supplier selection process in the supply chain has become a key strategic consideration. With the growing worldwide awareness of environmental protection and the corresponding increase in legislation and regulations, green purchasing has become an important issue for companies to gain environmental sustainability. Traditionally, companies consider criteria such as price, quality and lead time, when evaluating supplier performance and do not give enough attention to environmental criteria as a means to evaluate suppliers. Now, many companies have begun to implement green supply chain management (GSCM) and to consider environmental issues and the measurement of their suppliers’ environmental performance. This paper examines GSCM to propose a fuzzy multi criteria approach for green suppliers’ evaluation. We apply fuzzy set theory to translate the subjective human perceptions into a solid crisp value. These linguistic preferences are combined through fuzzy TOPSIS to generate an overall performance score for each supplier. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - HCFC-22, widely used in variety of refrigerating/heating equipment, has been scheduled to be phased out by Montreal Protocol. This decision will result in significant reduction of ozone depletion and global warming, holding on the climate benefits accrued so far. In this paper, significant focuses were paid on the HCFC-22 elimination policies, advanced technologies, feasibility substitutes, revolutionary innovations, assessment strategy and developing tendency. The latest developing situation of R744, R717, HC-290, RE170, HFC-32, HFC-161, HFC-152a, HFO-1234yf, HFO-1234ze (E) and their blends were summarized and evaluated technically. Currently there has been no such kind of fluids which can replace HCFC-22 perfectly in most of existing equipment. Many factors must be taken into consideration when selecting an alternative, such as thermodynamic property, environmental impact, system efficiency, technology, flammability, toxicity, cost, policy etc., which can be regarded as a multi-objective decision problem. It is predicted to be increasingly important to research the flammable characteristics of refrigerants, including flammable limits, ignition energy, heat and product of combustion. Special security arrangements were suggested when operating with the flammable refrigerants, covering the whole lifetime. In consideration of current situations, the diversified solutions are the inevitable trends on the basic of comprehensive comparison.

AB  - The research presented in this paper proposes a new machine learning-based evaluation method for assessing the usability of eLearning systems. Three machine learning methods (support vector machines, neural networks and decision trees) along with multiple linear regression are used to develop prediction models in order to discover the underlying relationship between the overall eLearning system usability and its predictor factors. A subsequent sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the rank-order importance of the predictors. Using both sensitivity values along with the usability scores, a metric (called severity index) is devised. By applying a Pareto-like analysis, the severity index values are ranked and the most important usability characteristics are identified. The case study results show that the proposed methodology enhances the determination of eLearning system problems by identifying the most pertinent usability factors. The proposed method could provide an invaluable guidance to the usability experts as to what measures should be improved in order to maximize the system usability for a targeted group of end-users of an eLearning system.

AB  - The topic of clustering has been widely studied in the field of Data Analysis, where it is defined as an unsupervised process of grouping objects together based on notions of similarity. Clustering in the field of Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) has seen a few adaptations of methods from Data Analysis, most of them however using concepts native to that field, such as the notions of similarity and distance measures. As in MCDA we model the preferences of a decision maker over a set of decision alternatives, we can find more diverse ways of comparing them than in Data Analysis. As a result, these alternatives may also be arranged into different potential structures. In this paper we wish to formally define the problem of clustering in MCDA using notions that are native to this field alone, and highlight the different structures which we may try to uncover through this process. Following this we propose a method for finding these structures. As in any clustering problem, finding the optimal result in an exact manner is impractical, and so we propose a stochastic heuristic approach, which we validate through tests on a large set of artificially generated benchmarks.

AB  - In this work we propose a user-friendly medically oriented tool for prognosis development systems and experimentation under a case-based reasoning methodology. The tool enables health care collaboration practice to be mapped in cases where different doctors share their expertise, for example, or where medical committee composed of specialists from different fields work together to achieve a final prognosis. Each agent with a different piece of knowledge classifies the given cases through metrics designed for this purpose. Since multiple solutions for the same case are useless, agents collaborate among themselves in order to achieve a final decision through a coordinated schema. For this purpose, the tool provides a weighted voting schema and an evolutionary algorithm (genetic algorithm) to learn robust weights. Moreover, to test the experiments, the tool includes stratified cross-validation methods which take the collaborative environment into account. In this paper the different collaborative facilities offered by the tool are described. A sample usage of the tool is also provided.

AB  - Suggesting personalized itinerary search for travelers in a multimodal transportation system is a challenging problem. This is due to the increased complexity and diversity of transportation means, the intricacy and multitude of destinations along with the amount of rapidly changing information available to the traveler. Providing the transportation user with the relevant information that only meets his needs, preferences and personal profile is of foremost importance in efficiently supporting passenger mobility requirements in a large urban agglomeration. In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria approach for suggesting personalized itinerary to transportation users based on their preferences and needs. The proposed approach integrates case-based reasoning with Choquet integral to suggest the itinerary that best matches the user’s preferences. Further, the proposed method predicts the user’s behavior by comparing his preferences to those of other users with the same preferences for a given context. This will help the user to adopt the best action when facing a new situation in his itinerary search. This will help the user adopt the best action facing a new situation. Personalized information retrieval is processed based on criteria which weights are determined using the two-additive Choquet integral. The performance of the proposed algorithm was assessed by solving a real-life itinerary planning problem defined in the Tunisian urban public transit network. A comparison study involving both qualitative and quantitative assessment of the proposed approach as compared to two other methods was also carried out. Based on the performance analysis, as well as the comparison study, our new approach provides the best solutions for applications requiring personalization based user’s preferences in a multi-criteria setting.

AB  - The main idea behind this study is to introduce a fuzzy grey relational methodology (FGRM) to determine the importance of customer attributes’ (CAs) for edible oil, particularly for defining the opportunity of competitiveness which has recently become one of an important concern of manufacturing companies. It was also aimed to seek high quality level of product and process characteristics for meeting the desirability of attributes and for health care. A fuzzy grey inference system was employed with the support of fuzzy quality function (QFD) deployment to interpret the qualitative and imprecise customer attributes. Fuzzy QFD is relatively a recent methodology offering a more in-depth analysis and investigation into the handling of customer requirements and engineering characteristics. The attributes then were defuzzified into quantitative values by amalgamating the knowledge of the customers and the product designers. Customer needs (CNs) are the voice of customers and tend to be linguistic naturally. In this study, fuzzy inference system (FIS) along with fuzzy QFD was employed to determine the desirability of edible oil by consumers. Fuzzy QFD is a powerful tool for improving product design and quality, and procuring a customer-driven quality system. The integrated framework based on FIS, fuzzy QFD and FGRM determined the CAs relations, and desirability level of edible oil by consumers. The findings are not only meaningful for customers, but also important for market position of product. The methodology significantly reduces the complexity of decision making and increase the production efficiency and overall competitiveness.

Specific energy absorption, peak force and crushing force efficiency (CFE) were used to determine energy absorbing capacity in empty and foam-filled tubes using both finite element and smooth particle hydrodynamics methods. Numerical results showed that SEA and peak force increased with increasing thickness of upper part and foam density while peak forces were significantly low in TWTs made from different materials. Moreover, CFE decreased with increasing thickness of upper part and with decreasing welding location whereas CFE slightly increased with increasing foam density.

AB  - A number of practical optimization problems are posed as many-objective (more than three objectives) problems. Most of the existing evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms, which target the entire Pareto-front are not equipped to handle many-objective problems. Though there have been copious efforts to overcome the challenges posed by such problems, there does not exist a generic procedure to effectively handle them. This paper presents a simplify and solve framework for handling many-objective optimization problems. In that, a given problem is simplified by identification and elimination of the redundant objectives, before interactively engaging the decision maker to converge to the most preferred solution on the Pareto-optimal front. The merit of performing objective reduction before interacting with the decision maker is two fold. Firstly, the revelation that certain objectives are redundant, significantly reduces the complexity of the optimization problem, implying lower computational cost and higher search efficiency. Secondly, it is well known that human beings are not efficient in handling several factors (objectives in the current context) at a time. Hence, simplifying the problem a priori addresses the fundamental issue of cognitive overload for the decision maker, which may help avoid inconsistent preferences during the different stages of interactive engagement. The implementation of the proposed framework is first demonstrated on a three-objective problem, followed by its application on two real-world engineering problems.

AB  - Astronomical observatory site selection is a complex problem that involves evaluation of multiple factors from different sources. The aim of this study is to select the best possible candidates for astronomical observations sites using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis integrated with Geographical Information Systems and remote sensing technologies. The study was implemented in the Antalya province of Turkey, which is convenient for astronomical site observatory facilities with its appropriate climate properties and weather conditions. Eleven factors (cloud cover, precipitable water, earthquake zones, geology, landslide inventory, active fault lines, Digital Elevation Model, city lights, mining activities, settlement areas, roads) were determined, splitting into three categories; meteorological, geographical and anthropogenic criteria. These factors were evaluated using Analytical Hierarchy Process method and the weights of criteria layers were determined. As a result, the most suitable areas were located extensively in western and eastern part of Antalya. This study offers a robust, accurate, cost and time effective procedure for preliminary site selection for astronomical observatory. However, for a final decision of the best location of astronomical observatory, site testing measurements and atmospheric seeing observations will be further required in these preliminary areas.

AB  - The Enterprise Resource Planning system (ERP) has been pointed out as a new information systems paradigm. However, achieving a proper level of ERP success relies on a variety of factors that are related to an organization or project environment. In this paper, the idea of predicting ERP post-implementation success based on organizational profiles has been discussed. As with the need to create the expectations of organizations of ERP, an expert system was developed by exploiting the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method to articulate the relationships between some organizational factors and ERP success. The expert system role is in preparation to obtain data from the new enterprises that wish to implement ERP, and to predict the probable system success level. To this end, factors of organizational profiles are recognized and an ANN model is developed. Then, they are validated with 171 surveyed data obtained from Middle East-located enterprises that experienced ERP. The trained expert system predicts, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.744, which is respectively high, and supports the idea of dependency of ERP success on organizational profiles. Besides, a total correct classification rate of 0.685 indicates good prediction power, which can help firms predict ERP success before system implementation.

AB  - Data mining has been widely applied to make prediction for finance crisis risk, and they often obtain a good result. Financial distress prediction can be formulated as a classification problem using data mining. Many data mining methods for classification can be used to solve the finance early-warning problem, however, “one time” data mining process cannot often obtain a well support decision, and one single method has its weakness for classification. In this paper, we use information fusion technique to build a finance early-warning model based on data mining methods, which can integrate the respective strengths from different data mining methods to improve the prediction accuracy rate, it fuses the different data mining results to gain the prediction results for reliable decision. We also choose the real dataset of Chinese listed manufacturing companies to predict the finance risk with information fusion technique based on SVM and Logistic model, and make comparison with the two methods to make prediction respectively.

AB  - Investment in new large transportation infrastructure is capital-intensive and irreversible in nature. Private sector participation in infrastructure investment has gained popularity in recent times because of scarcity of resources at the public sector, and because of the ability of the private sector to build, operate, maintain such facilities, and share future uncertainties. In such cases, there are multiple entities each with different objectives in the project. Traditional techniques used to determine feasibility of such projects and do not consider two critical elements. These are the need (1) to identify major entities involved in these projects and their individual objectives, and (2) the importance of analyzing measures of effectiveness of each entity in a multi-objective context. A framework is proposed to address these issues along with a set of relaxation policies to reflect the nature and level of participation by the entities. First, the feasibility of each single entity perspective is determined and next, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) is proposed reflecting the perspectives of all entities. The MOO results in pareto-optimal solutions to serve as tradeoff between the participation levels of the multiple entities. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used as a tool to narrow down number of options for decision makers for further consideration. AHP and MOO are integrated to determine the feasibility of strategies from multi-entity perspectives. The framework is examined on the proposed multibillion dollar international river crossing connecting the city of Detroit in the U.S. and the city of Windsor in Canada. This methodology provides a decision making process tool for large-scale transportation infrastructure investment consisting of multiple entities.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate an ordered multiplicative modular geometric operator and its relevant properties. The ordered multiplicative modular geometric operator is a generalized form of the ordered weighted geometric operator which has been designed incorporating the advantages of the geometric mean to deal with ratio judgments and the advantages of the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator to represent the concept of fuzzy majority in the process of information aggregation. Besides, the ordered multiplicative modular geometric operator can be seen as a symmetrized multiplicative modular aggregation function, characterized by comonotone multiplicative modularity. It is worth pointing that lots of the existing operators (such as the ordered weighted geometric operator, the weighted geometric operator, the ordered weighted maximum, and the Max and Min operators) can be regarded as the special cases of the ordered multiplicative modular geometric operator, which is of value in developing the theory of geometric operators.

AB  - Supplier evaluation and selection process has a critical role and significant impact on purchasing management in supply chain. It is also a complex multiple criteria decision making problem which is affected by several conflicting factors. Due to multiple criteria effects the evaluation and selection process, deciding which criteria have the most critical roles in decision making is a very important step for supplier selection, evaluation and particularly development. With this study, a hybridization of fuzzy c-means (FCM) and rough set theory (RST) techniques is proposed as a new solution for supplier selection, evaluation and development problem. First the vendors are clustered with FCM algorithm then the formed clusters are represented by their prototypes that are used for labeling the clusters. RST is used at the next step of modeling where we discover the primary features in other words the core evaluation criteria of the suppliers and extract the decision rules for characterizing the clusters. The obtained results show that the proposed method not only selects the best supplier(s), also clusters all of the vendors with respect to fuzzy similarity degrees, decides the most critical criteria for supplier evaluation and extracts the decision rules about data.

AB  - The planning and subsequent implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems still present a significant challenge for most organizations. Although consulting firms and customer enterprises have been aquiring more experience and expertise in the field, the level of sophistication of these systems and their wide organizational and social impact frequently leads to failed ERP implementations. In an attempt to minimize these failure rates, this paper defines a set of value-based objectives that could be used to enrich the ERP systems planning process. ERP systems planning objectives grounded by stakeholder values can be used as a conceptual guide for enhancing the decision making processes involved in ERP projects. Using Keeney's value-focused thinking approach, a set of means and fundamental objectives was identified using data collected via in-depth interviews in three large European firms. The relationships and interdependancies among these objectives are also presented and provide a starting point for further research.

AB  - Summary
In this study, we apply artificial intelligence techniques to the development of two real-time pumping station operation models, namely, a historical and an optimized adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS-His and ANFIS-Opt, respectively). The functions of these two models are the determination of the real-time operation criteria of various pumping machines for controlling flood in an urban drainage system during periods when the drainage gate is closed. The ANFIS-His is constructed from an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using historical operation records. The ANFIS-Opt is constructed from an ANFIS using the best operation series, which are optimized by a tabu search of historical flood events. We use the Chung-Kong drainage basin, New Taipei City, Taiwan, as the study area. The operational comparison variables are the highest water level (WL) and the absolute difference between the final WL and target WL of a pumping front-pool. The results show that the ANFIS-Opt is better than the ANFIS-His and historical operation models, based on the operation simulations of two flood events using the two operation models.

AB  - One of the most critical and complicated steps in mine design is a selection of suitable mining method based upon geological, geotechnical, geographical, safety and economical parameters. The aim of this study is developing a Monte Carlo simulation to selection the optimum mining method by using effective and major criteria and at the same time, taking subjective judgments of decision makers into consideration. Proposed approach is based on the combination of Monte Carlo simulation with conventional Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the confidence level of each alternative’s score, is calculated by AHP, with the respect to the variance of decision makers’ opinion. The proposed method is applied for Jajarm Bauxite Mine in Iran and eventually the most appropriate mining methods for this mine are ranked.

AB  - Designing mostly involves complex problem solving and the need to consider many options. Design support tools facilitate the process of obtaining optimum solutions such as the most appropriate choice of material. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods are useful when multiple criteria need to be considered simultaneously. MCDM can be further categorized as multiple objective decision-making (MODM) and multiple attribute decision-making (MADM). The MODM methods enable complicated choices to be made as experienced in materials selection problems. The MADM methods are equally applicable to materials selection and to material design. The combination of computational materials science and modeling plays a key role in evaluating the performance metrics necessary to support materials selection and design. Although a large amount of research has been done in the past on materials selection using different MADM methods, there is still a need to develop MODM methods in engineering design applications and based on the true nature of problems. Therefore, further effort needs to be made to consider materials selection and design optimization simultaneously in the engineering design process.

AB  - Several statistical algorithms are used to categorize contractors. The number of categories depends on the clustering algorithm used. This paper presents a framework for classifying contractors using five of the most common clustering algorithms and assesses their performance with appropriate validity measures. The framework was implemented on actual data for 14 contractors working in UAE using a database of 294 projects. Quantitative measures were suggested and calculated for the contractors in the database. Qualitative measures were determined using AHP. The quality of contractor's staff and equipment was deemed to be the most important measure. The results show that contractors are grouped into four categories based on the quantitative and qualitative measures identified. The Fuzzy-C means algorithm had the highest validity measures when applied to the studied data set. The results show that the proposed framework can be used to categorize contractors into different performance groups in a rational and unbiased way.

This is done by benchmarking the ARBF–PSO results with those of three different neural networks architectures, a Nearest Neighbors algorithm (k-NN), an autoregressive moving average model (ARMA), a moving average convergence/divergence model (MACD) plus a naı¨ve strategy. More specifically, the trading and statistical performance of all models is investigated in a forecast simulation of the EUR/USD, EUR/GBP and EUR/JPY ECB exchange rate fixing time series over the period January 1999–March 2011 using the last 2years for out-of-sample testing. As it turns out, the ARBF–PSO architecture outperforms all other models in terms of statistical accuracy and trading efficiency for the three exchange rates.

AB  - This paper describes the application of a new multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique called fuzzy outranking to map prospectivity for porphyry CuMo deposits. Various raster-based evidential layers involving geological, geophysical, and geochemical geo-data sets are integrated for mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM). In a case study, 13 layers of the Now Chun deposit located in the Kerman province of Iran are used to explore the region of interest. The outputs are validated using 21 boreholes drilled in this area. Comparison of the output prospectivity map with concentrations of Cu and Mo in the boreholes indicates that the fuzzy outranking MCDM is a useful tool for MPM. The proposed method shows a high performance for MPM thereby reducing the cost of exploratory drilling in the study area.

KW  - Safety improvements
AB  - Every year, more than 400 people are killed in over 1.200 accidents at road-rail level crossings in the European Union (European Railway Agency, 2011). Together with tunnels and specific road black spots, level crossings have been identified as being a particular weak point in road infrastructure, seriously jeopardizing road safety. In the case of railway transport, level crossings can represent as much as 29% of all fatalities caused by railway operations. In Serbia there are approximately 2.350 public railway level crossings (RLC) across the country, protected either passively (64%) or by active systems (25%). Passive crossings provide only a stationary sign warning of the possibility of trains crossing. Active systems, by contrast, activate automatic warning devices (i.e., flashing lights, bells, barriers, etc.) as a train approaches. Securing a level crossing (whether it has an active or passive system of protection) is a material expenditure, and having in mind that Serbian Railways is a public company directly financed from the budget of the Republic of Serbia, it cannot be expected that all unsecured level crossings be part of a programme of securing them. The most common choice of which level crossings to secure is based on media and society pressure, and on the possible consequences of a rise in the number of traffic accidents at the level crossings. The process of selecting a level crossing where safety equipment will be installed is accompanied by a greater or lesser degree of uncertainty of the essential criteria for making a relevant decision. In order to exploit these uncertainties and ambiguities, fuzzy logic is used in this paper. Here also, modeling of the Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is presented, which supports the process of selecting which level crossings should receive an investment of safety equipment. The ANFIS model is a trained set of data which is obtained using a method of fuzzy multi-criteria decision making and fuzzy clustering techniques. 20 experts in road and rail traffic safety at railway level crossings took part in the study. The ANFIS model was trained with the experiential knowledge of these experts and tested on a selection of rail crossings in the Belgrade area regarding an investment of safety equipment. The ANFIS model was tested on 88 level crossings and a comparison was made between the data set it produced and the data set obtained on the basis of predictions made by experts.

AB  - Proactive environmental management initiatives such as pollution prevention, cleaner production and sustainability are inherently multi-objective processes that require joint considerations of environmental, industrial, economic and social criteria in all stages of decision making. The success of such initiatives, however, depends on the solidity and the relevance of their strategic frameworks. This paper proposes strategic positioning of pollution prevention and clean production projects via design of a sustainable environmental management system (SEMS) that is responsive to regulatory requirements, and is relevant to industry culture and business structure. Built on the traditional and familiar environmental management system platform and the requirements of the multi-criteria decision making models ELECTRE III, the SEMS is capable of supporting design and implementation of defensible solutions to environmental problems industry face today according to sustainability criteria. The ELECTRE III model was selected as an integral part of the framework due to its ease of application, flexibility in design and selection of performance criteria, and capability to identify the best management solutions by giving an order of preference to multiple alternatives. The proposed SEMS framework is also in line with the Rio+20 sustainable development goals, objectives and guidelines that call for action and result-oriented strategies and institutional frameworks that could account for multiple stakeholders' key issues while suggesting environmental solutions according to the three dimensions of sustainable development. A case study that demonstrates the management of waste streams at a manufacturer of energy drinks and diet bars is provided to demonstrate how the SEMS can be designed and implemented.

AB  - Sustainable supply chain management has received much attention from practitioners and scholars over the past decade owing to the significant attention given by consumers, profit and not-for-profit organizations, local communities, legislation and regulation to environmental, social and corporate responsibility. Sustainable supply chain initiatives like supplier environmental and social collaboration can play a significant role in achieving the “triple bottom line” of social, environmental, and economic benefits. Supplier selection plays an important role in the management of a supply chain. Traditionally, organizations consider criteria such as price, quality, flexibility, etc. when evaluating supplier performance. While the articles on the selection and evaluation of suppliers are abundant, those that consider sustainability issues are rather limited. This paper explores sustainable supply chain initiatives and examines the problem of identifying an effective model based on the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) approach (economic, environmental, and social aspects) for supplier selection operations in supply chains by presenting a fuzzy multi criteria approach. We use triangular fuzzy numbers to express linguistic values of experts' subjective preferences. Qualitative performance evaluation is performed by using fuzzy numbers for finding criteria weights and then fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is proposed for finding the ranking of suppliers. The proposed approach is illustrated by an example.

AB  - Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is the field of software engineering research and practice that applies search based techniques to solve different optimization problems from diverse software engineering areas. SBSE approaches allow software engineers to automatically obtain solutions for complex and labor-intensive tasks, contributing to reduce efforts and costs associated to the software development. The SBSE field is growing rapidly in Brazil. The number of published works and research groups has significantly increased in the last three years and a Brazilian SBSE community is emerging. This is mainly due to the Brazilian Workshop on Search Based Software Engineering (WOES), co-located with the Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES). Considering these facts, this paper presents results of a mapping we have performed in order to provide an overview of the SBSE field in Brazil. The main goal is to map the Brazilian SBSE community on SBES by identifying the main researchers, focus of the published works, fora and frequency of publications. The paper also introduces SBSE concerns and discusses trends, challenges, and open research problems to this emergent area. We hope the work serves as a reference to this novel field, contributing to disseminate SBSE and to its consolidation in Brazil.

AB  - When selecting materials, formalized screening methods help to narrow down the choice of materials to a more manageable number for subsequent detailed evaluation. The screening methods available range from manual to computer-based packages as either stand alone or linked to materials’ properties databases or integrated with other design support tools. Of all the current methods available, the most popular way of screening materials is via the use of materials selection charts (“Ashby” method). The charts allow a direct comparison to be easily made of different material properties or a limited combination of material properties via the use of performance indices. Multi-criteria decision-making techniques can be applied when a large number of materials selection criteria need to be considered simultaneously. The selection of materials derived from the charts is normally left quite broad to initially keep options open and narrowed down as the design develops.

AB  - By attention to this matter that the Caspian sea is very important area because of its economical, environmental, fishery parameters and by its high length it is always exposed to the negative effects of oil spills, so determination of its sensitive coastal areas to oil spills according to effective criteria and presentation of some methods to develop the models much necessary. In this paper, a structured GIS-based fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model is applied through combining the concepts of fuzzy set theory, hierarchical structure analysis, and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment, then the model of protecting decision system is presented to make the preference for the sensitive coastal areas of Mazandaran province (North of Iran) to oil spills. For creating this model, at first the hazard line (affected coastal areas to oil spills) and effective criteria (physical parameters, biological and socio-economic resources) are recognized according literature and expert's opinion and thematic maps are developed in GIS. Then, the processed layers are weighted, scored and combined in a fuzzy decision making environment and sensitivity maps are prepared, it helps the managers for determining and recognizing the priorities so by recognition of the resources which are exposed to the danger and protection of more sensitive areas is done as soon as possible. The paper shows that the applied fuzzy method is an effective method to evaluate shoreline sensitivity area to oil spills. Also the results of case study shows the most shoreline of Mazandaran province are medium and high sensitive and regions which are near Gorgan bay are very high sensitive to oil spills.

Earlier, similarity classifier was mainly used with generalized mean operator, but in this article we extend this aggregation process to cover more general OWA operators. With OWA operators we concentrate on linguistic quantifier guided aggregation where several different quantifiers are studied and on how they best suite for the similarity classifier. Our proposed method is applied to real world medical data sets which are new thyroid, hypothyroid, lymphography and hepatitis data sets. Results are very promising and show improvement compared to the earlier used generalized mean operator. In this article we will show that by using OWA operators instead of generalized mean, we can improve classification accuracy with chosen data sets.

By constructing a novel augmented Lyapunov functional which contains some triple-integral terms, improved delay-dependent stability criteria are derived in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) by introducing some free-weighting matrices and using integral inequality technique and convex combination method. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Knowledge management (KM) has recently emerged as a discrete area in the study of organizations and frequently cited as an antecedent of organizational performance. This study aims at investigating the impact of KM practices on organizational performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in service industry. Four popular machine learning techniques (i.e., neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees and logistic regression) along with statistical factor analysis (EFA and CFA) are used to developed predictive and explanatory models. The data for this study is obtained from 277 SMEs operating in the service industry within the greater metropolitan area of Istanbul in Turkey. The analyses indicated that there is a strong and positive relationship between the implementation level of KM practices and organizational performance related to KM. The paper summarizes the finding of the study and provides managerial implications to improve the organizational performance of SMEs through effective implementation of KM practices.

AB  - One of the most challenging issues in earthquake engineering is structural damage determination, monitoring and resistance in earthquake conditions. In this regard, the need for design and construction of smart systems with structural form, combinational and behavioral adaption capability with environmental conditions in recent decades has been increased. These structures own natural or acquired capability in responding exteroceptives and capability of form, combination and behavior adaption with environmental conditions. One of the most vital and basic infrastructures playing an important role in earthquake crisis management is the bridges. Destruction and damage of the bridges can make rescue operations encounter critical problems. Thus, taking smart systems into account in the structure of these bridges is essential in order to decrease earthquake impact and increase reliability of the bridges. In this regard, this research is centralized on different possible methods of designing the smart structure of vital bridges in Iran against earthquake effects. Five main methods have been chosen by asking experts in the related fields and to evaluate and select a proper way to design smart bridges. Five indices of casualty and vulnerability reduction, possibility of localization of sensor technology, performance costs, performance speed and maintenance were considered and using pairwise comparison method final weight of indices. Finally methods have been determined and we came up with the result that active structures method is the optimal method in smart bridges.

AB  - Technology selection, which influences the competitive advantages of an enterprise or a country, is a multi-criteria decision issue. In addition, it is increasingly difficult to identify the right technologies because technologies are increasing in number and complexity. This study proposes a technology selection process integrating the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Delphi method. The former effectively conducts the fuzziness existing in experts' responses and identifies the strength of technology selection criteria and the relationship between the two. The latter provides the main technology alternatives for Taiwan's future photovoltaic industry. Finally, through the two-way linkage between technology selection criteria and main industrial technologies, the technology fields of the photovoltaic industry can be identified. The empirical results indicate that the benefit of a technology is the most important factor among technological selection criteria, and that Taiwan should adopt and develop microcrystalline silicon film multi-junction and amorphous-silicon solar cells as its main industrial technologies. The results may serve to guide industrial technology acquisition and the work of resource allocations on the behalf of government and enterprises.

AB  - An organization's environmental performance is affected by its suppliers' environmental performance, and selecting green suppliers is a strategic decision in order to be more competitive in today's global market. The supplier selection problem involves several quantitative and qualitative criteria. In the supplier selection process, if suppliers have limited capacity or other constraints, it is necessary to determine the best supplier and order quantity of each supplier. In this paper, we present an integrated approach, of fuzzy multi attribute utility theory and multi-objective programming, for rating and selecting the best green suppliers according to economic and environmental criteria and then allocating the optimum order quantities among them. At first, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution is applied in order to analyze the importance of multiple criteria by incorporating experts' opinion and to determine the best green suppliers. Next, multi-objective linear programming is used to consider and to formulate various constraints such as quality control, capacity, and other objectives. The objective of the mathematical model is simultaneously to maximize the total value of purchasing and to minimize the total cost of purchasing. To handle the subjectivity of decision makers' preferences, fuzzy logic has been applied. The efficiency and application of the proposed approach has been illustrated with a case study in an automobile manufacturing company. The obtained results help firms establish a systematic approach for tackling green supplier selection and order allocation problems in a realistic situation. Finally managerial implications, conclusions, and directions for additional research are introduced.

AB  - In this contribution, a structural design concept, suitable for the application to passenger car tire development process is proposed. The focus is set on one hand on providing an appropriate multi-objective optimization approach, enabling the consideration of multiple requirements which a tire should satisfy during the operating life, and on the other hand on accounting for uncertainty within the design concept. Due to the fact, that some structural parameters, considered at design stage, are specified on the basis of vague, limited or imprecise information, it is required to model them as uncertain quantities. In this contribution, the uncertainty model fuzziness is utilized. The consideration of uncertainty in the design approach enables, beside the optimization of the objective functions, also robustness quantification and optimization. Numerical efficiency of the proposed methodology is increased through the substitution of the expensive FE tire analysis by a neural network based response surface approximation.

AB  - This paper addresses a comprehensive efficiency evaluation model for electrical distribution system. Concerning the efficiency of different resources including energy, infrastructure and human resources, the overall distribution system efficiency is determined on the basis of relevant efficiency indicators. The employed efficiency indicators comprising loss, utilization factor, power factor, load factor, energy not supplied and human resource productivity express the efficiency of the above-mentioned resources. The proposed model takes into account the effect of certain external factors on the performance of distribution system. It has been shown that how external factors such as governance, social behavior and urban planning can directly influence the efficiency of the system. The correlation between efficiency indicators and external factors is derived using artificial neural network and a sensitivity analysis is conducted to illuminate the path of efficiency increment through managing the effective external factors. These indices can be used for improvement of the system performance in system planning. An empirical study is addressed here based on a real world distribution network to investigate the performance of the proposed model.

AB  - Project selection is a complex decision making process that is influenced by multiple and often conflicting objectives. The complexity of the project selection problem is due to the high number of projects from which a subset (portfolio) has to be chosen. We present a hybrid fuzzy rule-based multi-objective framework for sustainable project portfolio selection. The multiple and conflicting objectives are considered as the input variables in a Fuzzy Rule-Based (FRB) system developed to estimate the overall fitness (suitability) of the potential project portfolios. A hybrid multi-objective framework integrates and synthesizes the results from a data mining model with the results from a Data Envelope Analysis (DEA) model and an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to design the structure of the proposed FRB system. The proposed framework simultaneously considers the accuracy maximization and the complexity minimization objectives. A Genetic Based Machine Learning (GBML) method is utilized to design an alternative FRB system for comparison purposes. The proposed framework and the GBML method are used to assess the alternative project portfolios in a real-world financial services institution. The statistical analysis shows the performance dominance of the proposed hybrid framework over the GBML method based on selected accuracy and interoperability measures.

AB  - Skyline computation has many applications including multi-criteria decision making. In this paper, we study the problem of efficiently computing the skyline over sliding windows on uncertain data elements against probability thresholds. Firstly, we characterize the properties of elements to be kept in our computation. Then, we show the size of dynamically maintained candidate set and the size of skyline. Novel, efficient techniques are developed to process continuous probabilistic skyline queries over sliding windows. Finally, we extend our techniques to cover the applications where multiple probability thresholds are given, “top-k” skyline data objects are retrieved, or elements have individual life-spans. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed techniques are very efficient and can handle a high-speed data stream in real time.

The algorithmic aspect is covered by a newly proposed recursive cluster algorithm, which automatically generates hierarchies from card sorting data. Based on comparison with another basic algorithm and empirical engineered and real-case test data, we validate that our process efficiently produces reasonable hierarchies of descriptive elements like goal- or problem-criteria.

AB  - Selection of the best sub-contractor is a vital process in construction projects. There are many factors that must be taken into consideration when selecting sub-contractors. Improper selection of sub-contractors might lead to many problems during work progress. These include bad quality of work, and delay in project duration. This process is controlled by many factors. Forty six factors are collected from previous studies that influence sub-contractor selection. This paper identifies the most important factors that influence the selection of sub-contractors. A questionnaire was distributed to experts in the construction domain to determine the importance of factors that are taken into consideration by the main contractor to select the most suitable sub-contractor. A survey was carried out which was conducted with 29 experts in the construction field to determine the score of each factor. Statistical analysis is carried out on the feedback of the respondents of the survey. By using SPSS software, the frequency of the results of the questionnaire was determined. Examples of crosstabs between some of the most important factors are presented to provide a comparison between two factors. The mean score of each factor was determined and the p-value was calculated using the SPSS software, the significance of each factor used in the questionnaire is determined. Any factor that has a p-value less than 0.05 is considered a significant one.

AB  - Self-adaptive software is capable of evaluating and changing its own behavior, whenever the evaluation shows that the software is not accomplishing what it was intended to do, or when better functionality or performance may be possible. The topic of system adaptivity has been widely studied since the mid-60s and, over the past decade, several application areas and technologies relating to self-adaptivity have assumed greater importance. In all these initiatives, software has become the common element that introduces self-adaptability. Thus, the investigation of systematic software engineering approaches is necessary, in order to develop self-adaptive systems that may ideally be applied across multiple domains. The main goal of this study is to review recent progress on self-adaptivity from the standpoint of computer sciences and cybernetics, based on the analysis of state-of-the-art approaches reported in the literature. This review provides an over-arching, integrated view of computer science and software engineering foundations. Moreover, various methods and techniques currently applied in the design of self-adaptive systems are analyzed, as well as some European research initiatives and projects. Finally, the main bottlenecks for the effective application of self-adaptive technology, as well as a set of key research issues on this topic, are precisely identified, in order to overcome current constraints on the effective application of self-adaptivity in its emerging areas of application.

AB  - The multi-granularity problem is one of the key open problems in Granular Computing. Multiple descriptions of the same phenomena may use very different information granulations, complicating any comparison or synthesis of those descriptions. One method for solving this problem is to transform all observations to a common granulation; however, this granulation must be adequate to capture all important facets of the phenomena. Determining this “natural” granulation could be done by inductively learning and comparing multiple granular representations of the phenomenon, but this requires a dedicated learning architecture. We present the Granular Neural Network, a novel adaptive neural network architecture that employs granular values and operations at the level of individual neurons. The Granular Neural Network is based on the multiplayer perceptron architecture and the backpropagation learning algorithm with momentum. It uses the operations of linguistic arithmetic to manipulate granular connection weights, which are represented by linguistic terms. We test the performance of the Granular Neural Network on three well-known benchmark datasets, and then explore its use in determining the “natural” granularity of a dataset.

AB  - Accuracy, complexity and interpretability are very important in credit classification. However, most approaches cannot perform well in all the three aspects simultaneously. The objective of this study is to put forward a classification approach named C-TOPSIS that can balance the three aspects well. C-TOPSIS is based on the rationale of TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). TOPSIS is famous for reliable evaluation results and quick computing process and it is easy to understand and use. However, it is a ranking approach and three challenges have to be faced for modifying TOPSIS into a classification approach. C-TOPSIS works out three strategies to overcome the challenges and retains the advantages of TOPSIS. So C-TOPSIS is deduced to have reliable classification results, high computational efficiency and ease of use and understanding. Our findings in the experiment verify the advantages of C-TOPSIS. In comparison with 7 popular approaches on 2 widely used UCI credit datasets, C-TOPSIS ranks 2nd in accuracy, 1st in complexity and is in 1st rank in interpretability. Only C-TOPSIS ranks among the top 3 in all the three aspects, which verifies that C-TOPSIS can balance accuracy, complexity and interpretability well.

Typically, on the services market, operates a number of contractors capable of carrying out the intended tasks, and each of them can provide different bid. Regardless of decision-maker's structure of the contracting preferences and number of evaluation criteria, it is necessary to verify whether the selected contractor is actually capable of completing contracted tasks. Very cheap offer may e.g. one be submitted by the bidder threatened with bankruptcy, fighting for survival. Described in this paper, method for assessing the reliability of contractors based on Partial Least Squares approach is fast and effective method to classify them in terms of risk of bankruptcy.

Too often, researchers are not aware of the impact of their data selection on the results. Their test beds are small, and the selection of the data sets is not supported by any previous data analysis. Conclusions drawn on such test beds cannot be generalised, because particular data characteristics may favour certain learners unnoticeably. This work raises these issues and proposes the characterisation of data sets using complexity measures, which can be helpful for both guiding experimental design and explaining the behaviour of learners.

AB  - The selection of the most suitable supplier for a procurement process has a markedly strategic aspect for a company. Within this ambit, the literature review shows a lack of uniformity in the terms used to define the phases or components of a procurement process as well as in the election of the critical variables used to select the most suitable supplier. Furthermore, this literature shows a wide variety of individual and integrated methodologies that have been developed so far in an attempt to optimise such a selection. This work proposes a new suppliers’ evaluation-and-selection model. The model homogenises the terminology involved in such processes and fulfils three main goals. First, it allows the joint assessment and comparison among new and historical suppliers, identifying the key evaluation factors in each case. Second, it allows the inherent knowledge about evaluation to be flexibly adapted to the type of product to be purchased – in this paper “basic products” – according to Kraljic's terminology (a major issue in procurement management and not taken into account by any of the models proposed so far). Finally, a FDSS is proposed to make the model operational. The proposed method is robust enough to improve the main shortcomings of more simplistic methods (e.g. those based on weights) and eases the comprehension of the embedded knowledge within the supplier evaluation processes. Simultaneously, this method avoids the complexity of real-life implementation that many of some more sophisticated hybrid methods proposed in recent times – not free of certain additional disadvantages. Finally, the practical usefulness of the proposed method is ascertained through an empirical test in a specific business environment.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that a well-known multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique called Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE II) to explore porphyry copper deposits can prioritize the ground-based exploratory evidential layers effectively. In this paper, the PROMETHEE II method is applied to airborne geophysical (potassium radiometry and magnetometry) data, geological layers (fault and host rock zones), and various extracted alteration layers from remote sensing images. The central Iranian volcanic-sedimentary belt is chosen for this study. A stable downward continuation method as an inverse problem in the Fourier domain using Tikhonov and edge-preserving regularizations is proposed to enhance magnetic data. Numerical analysis of synthetic models show that the reconstructed magnetic data at the ground surface exhibits significant enhancement compared to the airborne data. The reduced-to-pole (RTP) and the analytic signal filters are applied to the magnetic data to show better maps of the magnetic anomalies. Four remote sensing evidential layers including argillic, phyllic, propylitic and hydroxyl alterations are extracted from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images in order to map the altered areas associated with porphyry copper deposits. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on six Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images is implemented to map iron oxide layer. The final mineral prospectivity map based on desired geo-data set indicates adequately matching of high potential zones with previous working mines and copper deposits.

AB  - In the era of technology, a variety of powerful equipments are design to satisfy the demand of industry sector. However, these equipments need a stable and reliable electrical supply in order for the whole system to flow smoothly. The overview of this paper is mainly about the load shedding application toward a large pulp mill electrical system using the multi-decision making methods which are the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods. Whenever there are shortages of electrical supply, the load shedding method shall be applied in order to recover and stabilize the system. Load shedding is a module that shed the higher possible load in the system to overcome the voltage shortage in the system. The objective of this paper is to extract the possible unnecessary load and determine the ranking of the load according to their importance level. The proposed methods are to test on the plant load shedding table from a paper pulp mill industry with 25 load points for practical applications.

AB  - Project portfolio managers are multi-objective Decision-Makers (DMs) who are expected to select the best mix of projects by maximizing profits and minimizing risks over a multi-period planning horizon. However, project portfolio decisions are complex multi-objective problems with a high number of projects from which a subset has to be chosen subject to various constraints and a multitude of priorities and preferences. We propose a Goal Programming (GP) approach for project portfolio selection that embraces conflicting fuzzy goals with imprecise priorities. A fuzzy goal with an aspiration level and a predefined membership function is defined for each objective. The impreciseness in the priorities of the membership values of the fuzzy goals is modeled with fuzzy relations. This leads to type II fuzzy sets since fuzzy relations are organized between the membership values of the fuzzy goals which are themselves fuzzy sets. The proposed model is based on the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and fuzzy preference relations. TOPSIS is used to reduce the multi-objective problem into a bi-objective problem. The resulting bi-objective problem is solved with fuzzy GP (FGP). The fuzzy preference relations are used to help DMs express their preferences with respect to the membership values of the fuzzy goals. The proposed approach is used to solve a real-life problem characterized as a fuzzy Multi-Objective Project Selection with Multi-Period Planning Horizon (MOPS–MPPH). The performance of the proposed approach is compared with a competing method in the literature. We show that our approach generates high-quality solutions with minimal computational efforts.

AB  - This paper introduces a GIS framework (Polyscape) designed to explore spatially explicit synergies and trade-offs amongst ecosystem services to support landscape management (from individual fields through to catchments of ca 10,000km2 scale). Algorithms are described and results presented from a case study application within an upland Welsh catchment (Pontbren). Polyscape currently includes algorithms to explore the impacts of land cover change on flood risk, habitat connectivity, erosion and associated sediment delivery to receptors, carbon sequestration and agricultural productivity. Algorithms to trade these single-criteria landscape valuations against each other are also provided, identifying where multiple service synergies exist or could be established. Changes in land management can be input to the tool and “traffic light” coded impact maps produced, allowing visualisation of the impact of different decisions. Polyscape hence offers a means for prioritising existing feature preservation and identifying opportunities for landscape change. The basic algorithms can be applied using widely available national scale digital elevation, land use and soil data. Enhanced output is possible where higher resolution data are available (e.g., LIDAR, detailed land use or soil surveys). Deficiencies in the data are reduced by incorporating local stakeholder knowledge (increasing stakeholder participation in the negotiation process).

AB  - The aim of this paper is to propose a new hybrid method of urban road(s) selection and construction by using a combination of simulation and weighted goal programming (WGP) with different environmental and economical criteria. First, different scenarios were developed based on current and proved future urban land use and on feasibility. These scenarios then were simulated by applying EMME3 software for a scheduled year. The outputs for each scenario were used as input in weighted goal programming. By using the significance of goals which determined by opinion of experts, the pair-wise comparison procedure has been done. The results of WGP determine the scenario with the highest possible utility. This integrated methodology has been applied in the city of Isfahan (Iran). The selected scenario by the proposed methodology, improves the conditions of all six criteria in comparison with current traffic network. This methodology could be applicable for large-scale transportation networks.

KW  - Multi-materials design

KW  - Material selection
AB  - Multi-material design is known as a material selection strategy used to achieve higher product performance, weight savings and cost reduction. In lightweight designs, weight reduction by using multi-materials will reduce CO2 emission and increase fuel economy, which will significantly reduce environmental impact. Owing to the importance of reducing CO2 emission, automotive designs need to fulfil legislation requirements by attaining higher recyclability value. In this regard, an automotive should be highly recycled at the end of its life in order to extend the use of materials. In response to this problem, this paper presents a novel multi-material selection method for lightweight design, which incorporates recyclability for an automotive body assembly. The method is implemented in a real case study during the conceptual design phase in order to demonstrate its applicability in product design. The proposed method will assist designers to select the optimal combination of multi-materials for lightweight designs, taking into account its recyclability.

AB  - The paper investigates a robust optimisation for detail design of active shock control bump on a transonic Natural Laminar Flow (NLF) aerofoil using a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA) coupled to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs) software. For MOEA, Robust Multi-Objective Optimisation Platform (RMOP) developed at CIMNE is used. For the active shock control bump design, two different optimisation methods are considered; the first method is a Pareto-Game based Genetic Algorithm in RMOP (denoted as RMOGA). The second method uses a Hybridised RMOGA with Game-Strategies and a parallel computation for high performance computation. Numerical results show not only how the concept of Shock Control Bump (SCB) coupled to CFD can improve aerodynamic performance of classic transonic aerofoil at the variability of flight conditions but also how high performance (parallel/distributed) computation with applying Hybrid-Game increases the efficiency of optimisation in terms of computational cost and results accuracy.

AB  - Biomarker discovery is a challenging task of bioinformatics especially when targeting high dimensional problems such as SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) datasets. Various types of feature selection methods can be applied to accomplish this task. Typically, using features versus class labels of samples in the training dataset, these methods aim at selecting feature subsets with maximal classification accuracies. Although finding such class-discriminative features is crucial, selection of relevant SNPs for maximizing other properties that exist in the nature of population genetics such as the correlation between genetic diversity and geographical distance of ethnic groups can also be equally important. In this work, a methodology using a multi objective optimization technique called Pareto Optimal is utilized for selecting SNP subsets offering both high classification accuracy and correlation between genomic and geographical distances. In this method, discriminatory power of an SNP is determined using mutual information and its contribution to the genomic–geographical correlation is estimated using its loadings on principal components. Combining these objectives, the proposed method identifies SNP subsets that can better discriminate ethnic groups than those obtained with sole mutual information and yield higher correlation than those obtained with sole principal components on the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) SNP dataset.

AB  - Supply chain management has increasingly attracted attention as a systematic approach to integrate the supply chain in order to planning and controlling the materials and information from suppliers to customers. One of the most important issues in supply chain management is selection of the appropriate supplier which has significant effect on purchasing cost decrease and increase in the organization’s competition ability. Selection of the best supplier is naturally complex with no definite structure, and dependent on the type of suppliers’ activity. In the process of decision making about suppliers and many qualitative and quantitative performance indicators such as quality, price, flexibility, and due date should be considered. Then, the supplier selection problem is a multi-criteria decision making problem where numerous methods have been proposed to solve this problem so far. In the current paper, four suppliers of imported raw material “Tripolyphosphate (TPP)” (primary material to produce the detergent powder with a case study in Iran) are evaluated based on 25 effective criteria using the hierarchical fuzzy TOPSIS (HFTOPSIS) approach.

AB  - Surgical piglet castration without pain relief has been banned in organic farming in the EU since the beginning of 2012. Alternative methods therefore need to be implemented that improve animal welfare and solve the underlying problem of boar taint. This paper explores German organic consumers' preferences for piglet castration without pain relief and three alternative methods. In an innovative approach using a multi-criteria decision making procedure, qualitative data from focus group discussions were compared with quantitative results from Vickrey auctions. Overall, participants preferred all alternatives to castration without pain relief. Different aspects influenced willingness-to-pay for the methods. Animal welfare was important for the evaluation of castration without pain relief and castration with anaesthesia. Food safety played a major role for willingness-to-pay for immunocastration, while taste and, to some extent, animal welfare were dominant factors for fattening of boars. These differences should be considered when communicating the alternatives.

AB  - Simulator-based training is in constant pursuit of increasing level of realism. The transition from doctrine-driven computer-generated forces (CGF) to adaptive CGF represents one such effort. The use of doctrine-driven CGF is fraught with challenges such as modeling of complex expert knowledge and adapting to the trainees’ progress in real time. Therefore, this paper reports on how the use of adaptive CGF can overcome these challenges. Using a self-organizing neural network to implement the adaptive CGF, air combat maneuvering strategies are learned incrementally and generalized in real time. The state space and action space are extracted from the same hierarchical doctrine used by the rule-based CGF. In addition, this hierarchical doctrine is used to bootstrap the self-organizing neural network to improve learning efficiency and reduce model complexity. Two case studies are conducted. The first case study shows how adaptive CGF can converge to the effective air combat maneuvers against rule-based CGF. The subsequent case study replaces the rule-based CGF with human pilots as the opponent to the adaptive CGF. The results from these two case studies show how positive outcome from learning against rule-based CGF can differ markedly from learning against human subjects for the same tasks. With a better understanding of the existing constraints, an adaptive CGF that performs well against rule-based CGF and human subjects can be designed.

AB  - Traditional approaches for research project selection by government funding agencies mainly focus on the matching of research relevance by keywords or disciplines. Other research relevant information such as social connections (e.g., collaboration and co-authorship) and productivity (e.g., quality, quantity, and citations of published journal articles) of researchers is largely ignored. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a social network-empowered research analytics framework (RAF) for research project selections. Scholarmate.com, a professional research social network with easy access to research relevant information, serves as a platform to build researcher profiles from three dimensions, i.e., relevance, productivity and connectivity. Building upon profiles of both proposals and researchers, we develop a unique matching algorithm to assist decision makers (e.g. panel chairs or division managers) in optimizing the assignment of reviewers to research project proposals. The proposed framework is implemented and tested by the largest government funding agency in China to aid the grant proposal evaluation process. The new system generated significant economic benefits including great cost savings and quality improvement in the proposal evaluation process.

AB  - Smart Buildings aim to provide users with seamless, invisible and proactive services adapted to their preferences and needs. These services can be offered intelligently by means of considering the static and dynamical status of the building and the location of its occupants. Furthermore, gathering data about the identity and location of users enables to provide more personalized services, while wasted energy in overuse is reduced. But to cope with these objectives, it is necessary to acquire contextual information, both from users and the environment, using nonintrusive, ubiquitous and cheap technologies. In this work, we propose a low-cost and nonintrusive solution to solve the indoor localization problem focused on satisfying the requirements, in terms of accuracy in localization data, to provide customized comfort services in buildings, such as climate and lighting control, or security, with the goal of ensuring users comfort while saving energy. The proposed localization system is based on RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) and IR (Infra-Red) data. The solution implements a Radial Basis Function Network to estimate the location of occupants, and a Particle Filter to track their next positions. This mechanism has been tested in a reference building where an automation system for collecting data and controlling devices has been setup. Results obtained from experimental assessments reveal that, despite our localization system uses a relative low number of sensors, estimated positions are really accurate considering the requirements of precision to provide user-oriented pervasive services in buildings.

AB  - The main advantage of multi-objective genetic fuzzy systems (MoGFS) is that a number of non-dominated fuzzy rule-based systems are obtained along the tradeoff surface among conflicting objectives. Accuracy maximization, complexity minimization and interpretability maximization have often been used for multi-objective design of fuzzy rule-based classifiers. A number of non-dominated fuzzy rule-based classifiers are obtained by a single run of MoGFS. A human decision maker is supposed to choose a single final classifier from a number of obtained classifiers according to his/her preference. One problem, which has not been discussed in many studies on MoGFS, is how to choose a single final classifier. In this paper, we discuss classifier selection with no intervention of the decision maker. Whereas complexity and interpretability are very important factors in classifier selection, we concentrate on the maximization of generalization ability as the first step towards a more general handling of classifier selection. We propose the use of repeated double cross-validation (rdCV) to choose a single final classifier and to evaluate the generalization ability of the selected classifier. We also discuss how our approach can be applied to parameter specification, formulation selection and algorithm choice.

AB  - Selection of players for a sports team within a finite budget is a complex task which can be viewed as a constrained multi-objective optimization and a multiple criteria decision making problem. The task is specially challenging for the game of cricket where a team requires players who are efficient in multiple roles. In the formation of a good and successful cricket team, batting strength and bowling strength of a team are major factors affecting its performance and an optimum trade-off needs to be reached. We propose a novel gene representation scheme and a multi-objective approach using the NSGA-II algorithm to optimize the overall batting and bowling strength of a team with 11 players as variables. Fielding performance and a number of other cricketing criteria are also used in the optimization and decision-making process. Using the information from the trade-off front obtained, a multi-criteria decision making approach is then proposed for the final selection of team. Case studies using a set of players auctioned in Indian Premier League (IPL) 4th edition are illustrated and players’ current statistical data is used to define performance indicators. The proposed computational techniques are ready to be extended according to individualistic preferences of different franchises and league managers in order to form a preferred team within the budget constraints. It is also shown how such an analysis can help in dynamic auction environments, like selecting a team under player-by-player auction. The methodology is generic and can be easily extended to other sports like American football, baseball and other league games.

AB  - This paper offers a survey of recent work on particle swarm classification (PSC), a promising offshoot of particle swarm optimization (PSO), with the goal of positioning it in the overall classification domain. The richness of the related literature shows that this new classification approach may be an efficient alternative, in addition to existing paradigms. After describing the various PSC approaches found in the literature, the paper identifies and discusses two data-related problems that may affect PSC efficiency: high-dimensional datasets and mixed-attribute data. The solutions that have been proposed in the literature for each of these issues are described including recent improvements by a novel PSC algorithm developed by the authors. Subsequently, a positioning PSC for these problems with respect to other classification approaches is made. This is accomplished by using one proprietary and five well known benchmark datasets to determine the performances of PSC algorithm and comparing the obtained results with those reported for various other classification approaches. It is concluded that PSC can be efficiently applied to classification problems with large numbers of instances, both in continuous and mixed-attribute problem description spaces. Moreover, the obtained results show that PSC may not only be applied to more demanding problem domains, but it can also be a competitive alternative to well established classification techniques.

KW  - Intuitionistic preference relation
AB  - There may be prioritizations among criteria in some practical multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems, which are called prioritized MCDM ones. The investigation of such a kind of problems benefits the development of the MCDM. However, the existing methods of prioritized MCDM cannot cover all situations, so we develop a new method based on the idea of PROMETHEE in this paper so as to overcome the drawbacks of the existing methods. After determining the preferences among alternatives by compare them in pairs, we construct an intuitionistic preference relation. A linear optimization model is then established to derive the ranking order of the alternatives. At length, a simple example is taken to illustrate the feasibility and practicability of our new method.

AB  - Structural optimization for crashworthiness criteria is of particular significance especially at early stage of design. The comparative study of Kriging and radial basis function network (RBFN) was performed in order to improve the crashworthiness effects of honeycomb. Improving the crashworthiness characteristic of honeycomb was achieved using LS-OPT® and domain reduction strategy. This optimization is performed on the basis of validated numerical simulation to establish the approximated model to illustrate the relationship between the responses and design variables. The results showed that Kriging meta-model is excelled in accuracy, robustness and efficiency compared to radial basis function (RBF) and crashworthiness characteristic of honeycomb is improved by 4%.

KW  - SWOT analysis
AB  - The technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is a well-known multi-attribute decision making (MADM) method that is used to identify the most attractive alternative solution among a finite set of alternatives based on the simultaneous minimization of the distance from an ideal solution (IS) and the maximization of the distance from the nadir solution (NS). We propose an alternative compromise ratio method (CRM) using an efficient and powerful distance measure for solving the group MADM problems. In the proposed CRM, similar to TOPSIS, the chosen alternative should be simultaneously as close as possible to the IS and as far away as possible from the NS. The conventional MADM problems require well-defined and precise data; however, the values associated with the parameters in the real-world are often imprecise, vague, uncertain or incomplete. Fuzzy sets provide a powerful tool for dealing with the ambiguous data. We capture the decision makers’ (DMs’) judgments with linguistic variables and represent their importance weights with fuzzy sets. The fuzzy group MADM (FGMADM) method proposed in this study improves the usability of the CRM. We integrate the FGMADM method into a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis framework to show the applicability of the proposed method in a solar panel manufacturing firm in Canada.

KW  - Electre method
AB  - The unequal area facility layout problem (UA-FLP) comprises a class of extremely difficult and widely applicable optimization problems arising in diverse areas and meeting the requirements for real-world applications. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have recently proven their effectiveness in finding (sub) optimal solutions to many NP-hard problems such as UA-FLP. A main issue in such approach is related to the genetic encoding and to the evolutionary mechanism implemented, which must allow the efficient exploration of a wide solution space, preserving the feasibility of the solutions and ensuring the convergence towards the optimum. In addition, in realistic situations where several design issues must be taken into account, the layout problem falls in the broader framework of multi-objective optimization problems. To date, there are only a few multi-objective FLP approaches, and most of them employ over-simplified optimization techniques which eventually influence the quality of the solutions obtained and the performance of the optimization procedure. In this paper, this difficulty is overcome by approaching the problem in two subsequent steps: in the first step, the Pareto-optimal solutions are determined by employing Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) implementing four separate fitness functions within a Pareto evolutionary procedure, following the general structure of Non-dominated Ranking Genetic Algorithm (NRGA) and the subsequent selection of the optimal solution is carried out by means of the multi-criteria decision-making procedure Electre. This procedure allows the decision maker to express his preferences on the basis of the knowledge of candidate solution set. Quantitative and qualitative objectives are considered referring to the slicing-tree layout representation scheme. The numerical results obtained outperform previous referenced approaches, thus confirming the effectiveness of the procedure proposed.

AB  - Small-signal oscillations is one of the important problems in power system operation that caused by insufficient natural damping in the system. This paper uses the Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) to design a new robust PSS for multi-machine power systems able to provide acceptable damping over a wide range of operating points. In the design procedure the main purpose is to reject the load fluctuations and, therefore, a particular transfer function is used as the nominal plant. The parametric uncertainty in power system is readily handled using QFT. The decentralized design with a simple structure is easily applied to multi-machine power systems. The nonlinear time-domain simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. Results clearly show the benefits of the proposed controller for stability enhancement of power systems.

AB  - One of the important stages in supply chain management which regards all the activities from the purchasing of raw material to final delivery of the product is the supplier selection process. Since it is the first stage of the supply chain management, it is a critical process affecting the consecutive stages. It is simply desired to select the best supplier for a specific product. But since there are a lot of criteria and alternatives to be considered, numerous decision making models have been proposed to provide a solution to this problem. Within this study, an integrated approach including fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and a mixed integer linear programming model is developed to select the best supplier in a multi-item/multi-supplier environment. The importance value of each supplier with respect to each product is obtained via fuzzy TOPSIS in the first stage. Then in the second stage, these values are used as an input in the mathematical model which determines the suppliers and the quantities of products to be provided from the related suppliers. So as to validate the proposed methodology, an application is performed in air filter sector.

The optimizer drives an Artificial Neural Network and a Manufacturing Time Model in a repeated analysis scheme in order to increase the combustor liner LCF life and to reduce the liner cooling system manufacturing time, simultaneously. The ANN is trained with a set of fluid/structure/lifing simulations arranged in a three-levels dataset based on a properly designed DOE approach. The CFD simulations are carried out with a reliable and robust in-house developed three-dimensional high resolution reactive viscous flow solver, accounting for conjugate heat transfer approach; the liner structural analysis is performed with a standard FEM code while the liner life assessments are obtained through an in-house developed software operating on the temperature/stress fields. Results demonstrate the validity of the overall approach in a five-dimensional state space with truly moderate computational costs.

AB  - Clinical trials are the main source of information for the efficacy and safety evaluation of medical treatments. Although they are of pivotal importance in evidence-based medicine, there is a lack of usable information systems providing data-analysis and decision support capabilities for aggregate clinical trial results. This is partly caused by unavailability (i) of trial data in a structured format suitable for re-analysis, and (ii) of a complete data model for aggregate level results. In this paper, we develop a unifying data model that enables the development of evidence-based decision support in the absence of a complete data model. We describe the supported decision processes and show how these are implemented in the open source ADDIS software. ADDIS enables semi-automated construction of meta-analyses, network meta-analyses and benefit–risk decision models, and provides visualization of all results.

In this paper, we propose a decision support model for selecting design parameters for one-way floor slabs. This study aims to determine environmentally-friendly and cost-effective solutions that take into account the regulatory codes, materials and manufacturing process normally applied in Spain. To this end, we established a decision criterion based on the embodied CO2 and the overall cost of one-way floor slabs. Three decision trees were created to formulate useful rules to guide decisions on the design of one-way floor slabs. Finally, this case study conducted in Spain indicates that embodied CO2 can be reduced by almost 20% with a cost increase of less than 6%.

AB  - One of the most challenging topics for next‐generation wireless networks is the process of vertical handoff since many of wireless technologies overlap each other and build a heterogeneous topology. Several parameters, pertaining to user/application requirements and network conditions, such as data rate, service cost, network latency, speed of mobile, and etc. must be considered in the handoff process of heterogeneous networks along with RSSI information. In this paper, adaptive fuzzy logic‐based vertical handoff decision‐making algorithms are presented for wireless overlay networks which consist of GSM/GPRS/Wi-Fi/UMTS/WiMAX technologies. The parameters data rate, monetary cost, speed of mobile and RSSI information are processed as inputs of the proposed fuzzy‐based systems. According to these parameters, an output value, which varies between 1 and 10, is produced. This output value is utilized to determine whether a handoff process is necessary or not and to select the best candidate access point in the vicinity. The results show that, compared to the traditional RSSI‐based algorithm significantly enhanced outcomes can be achieved for both user and network as a consequence of the proposed fuzzy‐based handoff systems. The simulation results are also compared with those of classical MADM (Multiple Attribute Decision Making) method, i.e. SAW (Simple Additive Weighting). According to the results obtained, the proposed vertical handoff decision algorithms are able to determine whether a handoff is necessary or not, properly, and select the best candidate access network considering the aforementioned parameters. Moreover, fuzzy‐based algorithm noticeably reduces the number of handoffs compared to SAW‐based algorithm.

A unique contribution of this paper is its perspective on how to servitize the product oriented DSS environment, and demonstrate the opportunities and challenges of engineering service oriented DSS in cloud. When we define data, information and analytics as services, we see that traditional measurement mechanisms, which are mainly time and cost driven, do not work well. Organizations need to consider value of service level and quality in addition to the cost and duration of delivered services. DSS in CLOUD enables scale, scope and speed economies. This article contributes new knowledge in service science by tying the information technology strategy perspectives to the database and design science perspectives for a broader audience.

AB  - Abstract:
The direct investment and joint ventures of clothing manufacturers in developing regions have grown rapidly over the last few decades. Manufacturers have encountered difficulties when selecting the plant location however, because their decisions are based on subjective judgments and inconsistent assessments rather than on a clear classification system. Variances between potential plants cannot always be represented in terms of objective value, such as country risk and community facilities. Clothing manufacturers must also consider more intangible factors such as the social environment and political stability when deciding the most appropriate site for production. Classification methods are a more efficient and less time-consuming way of organizing a number of sites into different levels of appropriateness, thereby allowing clothing manufacturers to make more informed and objective decisions about plant locations. This chapter investigates two recent types of classification technique; unsupervised and supervised artificial neural networks. The limitations of the adaptive resonance theory of the unsupervised artificial neural network are demonstrated in this chapter and a comparison of the performance of the three types of supervised artificial neural network, back propagation, learning vector quantization and probabilistic neural network are presented. The supervised artificial neural network has proved to be an effective classifier in which the probabilistic neural network performs better than in the other networks on the site selection problem.

AB  - Studies worldwide suggest that the risk of water shortage in regions affected by climate change is growing. Decision support tools can help governments to identify future water supply problems in order to plan mitigation measures. Treated wastewater is considered a suitable alternative water resource and it is used for non-potable applications in many dry regions around the world. This work describes a decision support system (DSS) that was developed to identify current water reuse potential and the variables that determine the reclamation level. The DSS uses fuzzy inference system (FIS) as a tool and multi-criteria decision making is the conceptual approach behind the DSS. It was observed that water reuse level seems to be related to environmental factors such as drought, water exploitation index, water use, population density and the wastewater treatment rate, among others. A dataset was built to analyze these features through water reuse potential with a FIS that considered 155 regions and 183 cities. Despite some inexact fit between the classification and simulation data for agricultural and urban water reuse potential it was found that the FIS was suitable to identify the water reuse trend. Information on the water reuse potential is important because it issues a warning about future water supply needs based on climate change scenarios, which helps to support decision making with a view to tackling water shortage.

AB  - The work reported in this paper addresses the challenge of the efficient and accurate defuzzification of discretised interval type-2 fuzzy sets. The exhaustive method of defuzzification for type-2 fuzzy sets is extremely slow, owing to its enormous computational complexity. Several approximate methods have been devised in response to this bottleneck. In this paper we survey four alternative strategies for defuzzifying an interval type-2 fuzzy set: (1) The Karnik–Mendel Iterative Procedure, (2) the Wu–Mendel Approximation, (3) the Greenfield–Chiclana Collapsing Defuzzifier, and (4) the Nie–Tan Method. We evaluated the different methods experimentally for accuracy, by means of a comparative study using six representative test sets with varied characteristics, using the exhaustive method as the standard. A preliminary ranking of the methods was achieved using a multi-criteria decision making methodology based on the assignment of weights according to performance. The ranking produced, in order of decreasing accuracy, is (1) the Collapsing Defuzzifier, (2) the Nie–Tan Method, (3) the Karnik–Mendel Iterative Procedure, and (4) the Wu–Mendel Approximation. Following that, a more rigorous analysis was undertaken by means of the Wilcoxon Nonparametric Test, in order to validate the preliminary test conclusions. It was found that there was no evidence of a significant difference between the accuracy of the Collapsing and Nie–Tan Methods, and between that of the Karnik–Mendel Iterative Procedure and the Wu–Mendel Approximation. However, there was evidence to suggest that the collapsing and Nie–Tan Methods are more accurate than the Karnik–Mendel Iterative Procedure and the Wu–Mendel Approximation. In relation to efficiency, each method’s computational complexity was analysed, resulting in a ranking (from least computationally complex to most computationally complex) as follows: (1) the Nie–Tan Method, (2) the Karnik–Mendel Iterative Procedure (lowest complexity possible), (3) the Greenfield–Chiclana Collapsing Defuzzifier, (4) the Karnik–Mendel Iterative Procedure (highest complexity possible), and (5) the Wu–Mendel Approximation.
