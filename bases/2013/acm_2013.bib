abstract = {The Multi-Criteria Recommender systems continue to be interesting and challenging problem. In this paper we will propose an approach for selection of relevant items in a RS based on multi-criteria ratings and a method of computing weights of criteria taken from Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM). This method proposes a correlation coefficient and standard deviation integrated approach for determining weight of criteria in multi-criteria recommender systems. We evaluated the proposed method on an example of movies recommendation. Our approach was compared to some other metrics used in Information Theoretic approach to illustrate its potential applications.},

abstract = {Simulation performance may be evaluated according to multiple quality measures that are in competition and their simultaneous consideration poses a conflict. In the current study we propose a practical framework for investigating such simulation performance criteria, exploring the inherent conflicts amongst them and identifying the best available tradeoffs, based upon multiobjective Pareto optimization. This approach necessitates the rigorous derivation of performance criteria to serve as objective functions and undergo vector optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by applying it to a specific Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) simulation, with multiple stochastic quality measures. We formulate performance criteria of this use-case, pose an optimization problem, and solve it by means of a simulation-based Pareto approach. Upon attainment of the underlying Pareto Frontier, we analyze it and prescribe preference-dependent configurations for the optimal simulation training.},

abstract = {Multi-objective optimization problems are usually solved with evolutionary algorithms when the objective functions are cheap to compute, or with surrogate-based optimizers otherwise. In the latter case, the objective functions are modeled with powerful non-linear model learners such as Gaussian Processes or Support Vector Machines, for which the training time can be prohibitively large when dealing with optimization problems with moderately expensive objective functions. In this paper, we investigate the use of model trees as an alternative kind of model, providing a good compromise between high expressiveness and low training time. We propose a fast surrogate-based optimizer exploiting the structure of model trees for candidate selection. The empirical results show the promise of the approach for problems on which classical surrogate-based optimizers are painfully slow.},

abstract = {Informed decisions are based on the availability of information and the ability of decision-makers to manipulate this information. More often than not, the decision-relevant information is subject to uncertainty arising from different sources. Consequently, decisions involve an undeniable amount of risk. An effective visualisation tool to support informed decision-making must enable users to not only distil information, but also explore the uncertainty and risk involved in their decisions. In this paper, we present VisIDM, an information visualisation tool to support informed decision-making (IDM) under uncertainty and risk. It aims to portray information about the decision problem and facilitate its analysis and exploration at different levels of detail. It also aims to facilitate the integration of uncertainty and risk into the decision-making process and allow users to experiment with multiple "what-if" scenarios. We evaluate the utility of VisIDM through a qualitative user study. The results provide valuable insights into the benefits and drawbacks of VisIDM for assisting people to make informed decisions and raising their awareness of uncertainty and risk involved in their decisions.},

abstract = {For the design and integration of complex systems-of-systems, various architectural decisions for recurring design problems need to be made. This requires that the software architects consider various design issues and alternatives, make trade-offs for competing requirements, and adapt the decisions to specific technologies and systems. Documentations of reusable architectural design decisions (ADDs), e.g., pattern-based decisions, provide rather informal guidelines for making recurring ADDs. These and other factors introduce many sources of uncertainty in the architectural decision making process. Existing approaches do not consider this inherent uncertainty of architectural decision making, which has been until now largely ad hoc and informal, without explicit, automated support. Apart from that, the design rationale for repeated ADDs often remains undocumented, leading to loss of architectural knowledge. To address these problems we propose to provide semi-automated support for decision making and documentation of reusable ADDs under uncertainty using a fuzzy logic expert system. We motivate our approach using a systems-of-systems example from the industry automation area in which our approach has been applied.},

abstract = {Tourist Information Systems (TIS) provide recommendations and help users avoid information overload while planning their trip. In an effort to provide better results, most systems categorize users indiscreetly into pre-determined groups without considering users' complex preferences, resulting to suggestions that miss uniqueness and adaptation to users needs.We present a Tourist Information System that matches users' preferences to the places they wish to visit in a more personalized and integrated way, combining modern aspects and widely adopted technologies. More specifically, the proposed Personalized, Location-Aware Tourist Information System (PLATIS) collects personal data from users' social network profiles and destination data from several online sources and conceptualizes this information into corresponding ontologies with the help of Semantic Web. A Bayesian Network is used to match the ontologies and calculate the most probable recommendations. The final results are gathered and presented dynamically to an interactive map.},

abstract = {Nowadays local search services are essential to provide access to geographic entities and to satisfy users' spatial information needs. While the users of these services can look for the entities of interest on map interface via sequential search or browsing of individual categories, the visualization of multiple categories simultaneously is still not well supported. This limits the end users on abstracted view, exploration, and comparison of spatial areas with respect to multiple criteria of interests. In this research we investigate the end-user interaction for multi-criteria local search with two popular representations such as aggregated pixel and icon based visualizations. We present a grid-based interactive interface where users can select multiple criteria of interests and explore the relevant spatial regions via aggregated heatmap visualizations. We evaluate the design against icon/marker based visualization, which is an easy adaption of current commercial local search interfaces. We found that heatgrid visualization for local search performs as good as the more popular marker based interface. We report our findings on both visualizations regarding several user-centered aspects such as exploration ability, information overload and cognitive demand.},

abstract = {In most medium and large sized cities around the world, freight transportation operations might have a noticeable impact on urban traffic mobility as well as on city commercial activities. In order to reduce both traffic congestion and pollution levels, several initiatives have been traditionally implemented. One of the most common strategies concerns the allocation of urban distribution warehouses near the city center in order to consolidate freight delivery services. This paper considers the integrated problem of locating distribution centers in urban areas and the corresponding freight distribution (vehicle routing). The combined problem is solved by using a hybrid algorithm which employs Monte Carlo simulation to induce biased randomness into several stages of the optimization procedure. The approach is then validated using real-life data and comparing our results with results from other works already available in the existing literature.},

isbn = {9781479920778},

abstract = {Hub and spoke networks, while highly efficient, are fragile to targeted attacks: removal of the central hub destroys connectivity of the network. This fragility has led to the assertion that these networks are not suited to military distribution systems. However, military supply chains have redundancy induced by heterogeneous transportation modes (e.g., road, marine, and air) leading to enriched connectivity over a pure hub and spoke structure. In this paper a global military (hierarchical) hub and spoke network model is developed; the topological resilience of such networks are probed by stochastically sampling an ensemble of networks and simulating both random and targeted edge knockout, and the network properties relevant to resilience measured. It is found that such networks are resilient to continual attack and loss (network erosion), performing well relative to preferential (scale free) and random network benchmarks. This regime of network erosion is descriptive of modern asymmetric warfare.},
