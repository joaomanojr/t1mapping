abstract = {Public Clouds today provide a variety of services for data analysis such as Amazon Elastic MapReduce and Google BigQuery. Each service comes with a pricing model and service level agreement (SLA). Today's pricing models and SLAs are described at the level of compute resources (instance-hours or gigabytes processed). They are also different from one service to the next. Both conditions make it difficult for users to select a service, pick a configuration, and predict the actual analysis cost. To address this challenge, we propose a new abstraction, called a Personalized Service Level Agreement, where users are presented with what they can do with their data in terms of query capabilities, guaranteed query performance and fixed hourly prices.},

abstract = {The increasing use of sensor-derived information from planned, ad-hoc, and/or opportunistically deployed sensor networks provides enhanced visibility to everyday activities and processes, enabling fast-paced data-to-decision in personal, social, civilian, military, and business contexts. The value that information brings to this visibility and ensuing decisions depends on the quality characteristics of the information gathered. In this article, we highlight, refine, and extend upon our past work in the areas of quality and value of information (QoI and VoI) for sensor networks. Specifically, we present and elaborate on our two-layer QoI/VoI definition, where the former relates to context-independent aspects and the latter to context-dependent aspects of an information product. Then, we refine our taxonomy of pertinent QoI and VoI attributes anchored around a simple ontological relationship between the two. Finally, we introduce a framework for scoring and ranking information products based on their VoI attributes using the analytic hierarchy multicriteria decision process, illustrated via a simple example.},

abstract = {The research reported in this paper explored decision making and information use by public safety personal leading teams responding to major incidents. The research methodology was qualitative using critical incident technique and observation grounded in Activity Theory as meta-theoretical framework. The data gathered uncovered intuitive as well as analytic modes of thinking. We argue that this has implications for decision support and our understanding of decision making in time-constrained, complex and uncertain environments.},

abstract = {The Multi-Criteria Recommender systems continue to be interesting and challenging problem. In this paper we will propose an approach for selection of relevant items in a RS based on multi-criteria ratings and a method of computing weights of criteria taken from Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM). This method proposes a correlation coefficient and standard deviation integrated approach for determining weight of criteria in multi-criteria recommender systems. We evaluated the proposed method on an example of movies recommendation. Our approach was compared to some other metrics used in Information Theoretic approach to illustrate its potential applications.},

abstract = {Skyline analysis is a key in a wide spectrum of real applications involving multi-criteria optimal decision making. In recent years, a considerable amount of research has been contributed on efficient computation of skyline probabilities over uncertain environment. Most studies if not all, assume uncertainty lies only in attribute values. To the extent of our knowledge, only one study addresses the skyline probability computation problem in scenarios where uncertainty resides in attribute preferences, instead of values. However this study takes a problematic approach by assuming independent object dominance, which we find is not always true in uncertain preference scenarios. In fact this assumption has already been shown to be not necessarily true in uncertain value scenarios. Motivated by this, we revisit the skyline probability computation over uncertain preferences in this paper.We first show that the problem of skyline probability computation over uncertain preferences is #P-complete. Then we propose efficient exact and approximate algorithms to tackle this problem. While the exact algorithm remains exponential in the worst case, our experiments demonstrate its efficiency in practice. The approximate algorithm achieves ε-approximation by the confidence (1 − δ) with time complexity O(dn1/ε2 ln 1/δ), where n is the number of objects and d is the dimensionality. The efficiency and effectiveness of our methods are verified by extensive experimental results on real and synthetic data sets.},
