AB  - Human use of ecosystem resources and services is increasing worldwide, generating pressures that alter ecosystem structure, functioning and provision of services. Unexpected ecosystem change is becoming frequent, and the complex ways through which multiple human pressures may interact leave conservation practitioners and natural resource managers faced with high uncertainty. We developed a geospatial approach for modeling the complex relationships between multiple human pressures and coastal ecosystems status. This framework was then used to produce maps of the expected status of marine coastal ecosystems resulting from variation in the cumulative human pressure. The geospatial modeling approach we developed was tested on an emblematic study case requiring marine spatial planning, i.e. a recently established marine protected area (MPA) that will have to coexist with the expansion of a close commercial harbor. In the study case presented, our modeling approach was used to predict the status of coastal ecosystems resulting from different management alternatives. Results showed that should Port Authority support MPA in reducing human pressures in the area, coastal ecosystems would not be expected to further deteriorate as a consequence of harbor expansion. Our approach proved effective in modeling complex interaction among multiple pressures (e.g. synergisms) and predicting potential future scenarios. The implementation of this approach into geographical information systems (GIS) allows managers to represent the expected outcomes of their planned conservation efforts, thereby representing an important decision-support tool for finding efficient management solutions in the face of complex interactions and high uncertainty.

AB  - Maintenance and support may account for as much as 60 to 75% of the total lifecycle cost of a manufacturing system. This paper presents a review on the predictive maintenance approaches, methods and tools in manufacturing systems and proposes an integrated predictive maintenance platform. This platform consists of three pillars, namely data acquisition and analysis, knowledge management, and a sustainability maintenance dashboard. The first pillar is responsible for data extraction and processing, the second one focuses on the maintenance knowledge modeling and representation and the third pillar provides advisory capabilities on maintenance planning with special emphasis given to environmental and energy performance indicators.

AB  - Various methods of E-learning systems, based on information and communications, and geared towards improving learning effectiveness and students’ attention span, have been studied. However, most E-learning systems force students to follow the learning course or content established by a teacher. These methods are convenient, but they limit the effectiveness of E-learning. To overcome this limitation and increase effective learning, new techniques that reflect alternative learning styles, such as adaptive learning and personalized learning, have been studied. In this study, we proposed a Personalized Learning Course Planner (PLCP) that allows students to easily select the learning course they desire. User profile data was collected from the students’ initial priorities about learning contents as well as the test scores after their study. E-Learning Decision Support System (EL-DSS) in PLCP suggests an appropriate learning course organization, according to calculated results based on the user profile data. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, we implemented an English learning system consisting of PLCP. We conducted an experiment with 30 university students and evaluated students’ satisfaction by questionnaire analysis. The results indicate that the proposed system improved learning effectiveness and student satisfaction. Further investigation of the participants indicated that suggesting a learning course suitable for students’ previous test scores and priorities encouraged students to concentrate on the lesson.

AB  - Changing requirements and on-going decision making along the entire project life cycle are well handled by Agile methods. However Agile projects still use evaluation methods during the RFP stage that do not fulfill the flexibility mandated by the Agile manifesto. Current evaluation methods assume a single development alternative, and thus a fixed cost–benefit tradeoff. The proposed model provides a more realistic approach by relaxing this assumption. It assumes that a supplier can propose several different alternatives (Multi-Alternative Proposal) reflecting diverse potential cost-benefit tradeoffs. The model makes it possible to rank the suppliers of these Multi-Alternative Proposals at the RFP stage. The ideas behind the method combine concepts from both the Agile approach and Data Mining. Thus suppliers who provide multi-alternative proposals can be ranked in an objective, but very intuitive manner.

AB  - A novel interval set approach is proposed in this paper to induce classification rules from incomplete information table, in which an interval-set-based model to represent the uncertain concepts is presented. The extensions of the concepts in incomplete information table are represented by interval sets, which regulate the upper and lower bounds of the uncertain concepts. Interval set operations are discussed, and the connectives of concepts are represented by the operations on interval sets. Certain inclusion, possible inclusion, and weak inclusion relations between interval sets are presented, which are introduced to induce strong rules and weak rules from incomplete information table. The related properties of the inclusion relations are proved. It is concluded that the strong rules are always true whatever the missing values may be, while the weak rules may be true when missing values are replaced by some certain known values. Moreover, a confidence function is defined to evaluate the weak rule. The proposed approach presents a new view on rule induction from incomplete data based on interval set.

AB  - This paper develops an integrated approach, combining quality function deployment (QFD), fuzzy set theory, and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach, to evaluate and select the optimal third-party logistics service providers (3PLs). In the approach, multiple evaluating criteria are derived from the requirements of company stakeholders using a series of house of quality (HOQ). The importance of evaluating criteria is prioritized with respect to the degree of achieving the stakeholder requirements using fuzzy AHP. Based on the ranked criteria, alternative 3PLs are evaluated and compared with each other using fuzzy AHP again to make an optimal selection. The effectiveness of proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to a Hong Kong based enterprise that supplies hard disk components. The proposed integrated approach outperforms the existing approaches because the outsourcing strategy and 3PLs selection are derived from the corporate/business strategy.

AB  - Increasing use of renewable sources has a vital importance in mitigating increasing energy demand and global warming. The limited reserves and negative environmental impacts associated with fossil fuel consumption make the renewable energy sources considerable alternatives in case environmental externalities are taken into consideration. Pricing models for renewable energy alternatives are commonly based on the same fundamentals as the fossil fuels, but this approach neglects some of the characteristics that are unique to renewable energy alternatives. In order to develop more accurate pricing models these unique variables which are mostly considered as market externalities need to be integrated in the current forms of pricing models. The originality of this work is its ability to combine social, technical, environmental and economic aspects using analytic network process in order to provide a more holistic point of view on factors impacting renewable energy pricing through a comparison of two case studies. United States (U.S.) and Turkey are the two cases analyzed in this paper. U.S. represents a developed economy whereas Turkey represents a developing economy. It is expected that the results of this work would be helpful for further research in understanding the dynamics behind pricing mechanism of the renewable sources in different environments. For instance, fundamental differences in relative importance of pricing factors between two case countries have been identified as different levels of enforcement through laws and regulations, impact of geographic characteristics on site selection and job opportunities created through new investments.

AB  - We constructed hazard maps of ground subsidence around abandoned underground coal mines (AUCMs) in Samcheok City, Korea, using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and a geographical information system (GIS). To evaluate the factors related to ground subsidence, a spatial database was constructed from topographic, geologic, mine tunnel, land use, and ground subsidence maps. An attribute database was also constructed from field investigations and reports on existing ground subsidence areas at the study site. Five major factors causing ground subsidence were extracted: (1) depth of drift; (2) distance from drift; (3) slope gradient; (4) geology; and (5) land use. The adaptive ANFIS model with different types of membership functions (MFs) was then applied for ground subsidence hazard mapping in the study area. Two ground subsidence hazard maps were prepared using the different MFs. Finally, the resulting ground subsidence hazard maps were validated using the ground subsidence test data which were not used for training the ANFIS. The validation results showed 95.12% accuracy using the generalized bell-shaped MF model and 94.94% accuracy using the Sigmoidal2 MF model. These accuracy results show that an ANFIS can be an effective tool in ground subsidence hazard mapping. Analysis of ground subsidence with the ANFIS model suggests that quantitative analysis of ground subsidence near AUCMs is possible.

In order to prevent subjective or arbitrary behavior in bid evaluation process, a dynamic engineering Multi-Criteria Decision Making Model optimized by entropy weight was proposed. In this model, the dynamic weight of quotation was obtained through mutual game playing of bidders. Besides, objective entropy weight was employed to determine weight of other criteria except quotation. Dynamics, objectivity and scientificity were realized in this model. Moreover, this model was applied to evaluate bid of an assets packet project for an assets management corporation. Scientific and satisfying results were obtained. The results showed that subjectivity and arbitrariness were avoided successfully.

AB  - Capacity control implementations in make-to-order (MTO) revenue management typically are based on bid-prices, which are used to approximate the opportunity cost of accepting a customer request. However, in the face of stochastic demand, this approximation becomes less accurate and the performance of bid-prices may deteriorate. To address this problem, we examine the informational dynamics inherent in MTO capacity control problems and propose a two-stage capacity control approach based on bid-price updates. Updating is realized with neural networks, which are applied to adjust the selection criteria during the booking period with respect to online demand information. Not only is the resulting contribution margin positively influenced by the update, but also the downside risk of performing worse than a naive first-come-first-served policy. Results from computational experiments show that the proposed approach dominates traditional revenue management methods like randomized linear programming with and without resolving in expected contribution margin as well as in risk.

AB  - Delivering accurate cyclone forecasts in time is of key importance when it comes to saving human lives and reducing economic loss. Difficulties arise because the geographical and climatological characteristics of the various cyclone formation basins are not similar, which entail that a single forecasting technique cannot yield reliable performance in all ocean basins. For this reason, global forecasting techniques need to be applied together with basin-specific techniques to increase the forecast accuracy. As cyclone track is governed by a range of factors variations in weather conditions, wind pressure, sea surface temperature, air temperature, ocean currents, and the earth's rotational force―the coriolis force, it is a formidable task to combine these parameters and produce reliable and accurate forecasts. In recent years, the availability of suitable data has increased and more advanced forecasting techniques have been developed, in addition to old techniques having been modified. In particular, artificial neural network based techniques are now being considered at meteorological offices. This new technique uses freely available satellite images as input, can be run on standard PCs, and can produce forecasts with good accuracy. For these reasons, artificial neural network based techniques seem especially suited for developing countries which have limited capacity to forecast cyclones and where human casualties are the highest.

AB  - An incident is normally composed of three stages: pre-incident, during-incident and post-incident. The assessment is a prominent composition in the lifecycle of emergency management for the purpose of quick and effective response. Present-day assessment methods mainly concern the pre-incident risk evaluation and the post-incident loss evaluation. However, during-incident process assessment is of crucial importance to assist the decision-making in emergency response and eventually achieve the goals of emergency management. This paper analyzes the influencing factors of during-incident process assessment and proposes a conceptual model of assessment. Three during-incident process assessment strategies, namely, “mitigability”, “rescuability”, and recoverability are illustrated which quantitatively characterize the evolution of incidents and corresponding responses, and hence contribute to appropriate decisions in practical applications.

AB  - A large number of magnetic materials have been fabricated and found to be promising for their technological applications. However, it is difficult to select an optimal material (for technological application) because of the conflicting tradeoffs between their properties. In this context, the screening of magnetic materials is an important task. In this article, an attempt has been made to select the soft and hard magnetic materials using Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) approach. VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) and Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods (MADM techniques) are employed to evaluate the relative ranking of these materials understudy. The relative weights for the different attributes (properties) are calculated using Shannon’s entropy method. It is found that (Supermalloy, Magnifer 7904) (79Ni–15Fe–5Mo–0.5Mn) and Ferrite 4 (sintered) (SrO–6Fe2O3) are the optimal materials among studied soft and hard magnetic materials, respectively. Hierarchical clustering is used to classify magnetic materials under study. Pearson correlation coefficients are calculated between the attributes under study.

AB  - Metals in soils may present health risks to people. Authorities therefore take various measures to minimise human exposure to metal contaminants, especially in recreational environments used by vulnerable persons, such as children. This study investigates the presence of metals in playground surfaces from public parks in two urban areas of south-east Queensland, Australia, in order to identify possible sources of metal contamination, and to evaluate the efficacy of remedial measures that have been taken. With the help of chemometrics data analysis procedures, the most important sources of metals are identified as being the natural geochemical environment, followed by two sources deriving from traffic emissions, and, lastly, paint. Remedial measures taken by the authorities to limit metal content are also shown to have been successful.

AB  - This study aims to develop models and generate a decision support system (DSS) for the improvement of supplier evaluation and order allocation decisions in a supply chain. Supplier evaluation and order allocation are complex, multi criteria decisions. Initially, an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model is developed for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of suppliers. Based on these evaluations, a goal programming (GP) model is developed for order allocation among suppliers. The models are integrated into a DSS that provides a dynamic, flexible and fast decision making environment. The DSS environment is tested at the purchasing department of a manufacturer and feedbacks are obtained.

AB  - For manufacturing industries, financial performance evaluation is very important in a highly competitive environment. Therefore, an accurate and appropriate performance evaluation is critical. As financial performance indicators reflect the competitiveness of a company, they must be carefully identified in the evaluation process. Generally, traditional accounting-based financial performance (AFP) measures are used for performance evaluation. However, these measures are not sufficient for performance evaluation solely in the modern industry time. So, value-based financial performance (VFP) measures have recently been introduced to express the company value. In this paper, we propose a new financial performance evaluation approach to rank the companies of each sector in the Turkish manufacturing industry. For this purpose, a hierarchical financial performance evaluation model is structured based on the AFP and VFP main-criteria and their sub-criteria. We use fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to determine the weights of the criteria. The companies are ranked according to their own manufacturing sector by using TOPSIS and VIKOR comparatively. The results show that the obtained ranks of the companies by these methods are almost same with respect to their own sectors.

AB  - With the development of computer applications in ship design, optimization, as a powerful approach, has been widely used in the design and analysis process. However, the running time, which often varies from several weeks to months in the current computing environment, has been a bottleneck problem for optimization applications, particularly in the structural design of ships. To speed up the optimization process and adjust the complex design environment, ship designers usually rely on their personal experience to assist the design work. However, traditional experience, which largely depends on the designer’s personal skills, often makes the design quality very sensitive to the experience and decreases the robustness of the final design. This paper proposes a new machine-learning-based ship design optimization approach, which uses machine learning as an effective tool to give direction to optimization and improves the adaptability of optimization to the dynamic design environment. The natural human learning process is introduced into the optimization procedure to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Q-learning, as an approach of reinforcement learning, is utilized to realize the learning function in the optimization process. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization method, multi-agent system, and CAE software are used to build an integrated optimization system. A bulk carrier structural design optimization was performed as a case study to evaluate the suitability of this method for real-world application.

In this methodology, an asymmetric weighted LSSVM model is first proposed. Then the process of building the EP-based asymmetric weighted LSSVM ensemble learning methodology is described in detail. Two publicly available software defect datasets are finally used for illustration and verification of the effectiveness of the proposed EP-based asymmetric weighted LSSVM ensemble learning methodology. Experimental results reveal that the proposed EP-based asymmetric weighted LSSVM ensemble learning methodology can produce promising classification accuracy in software repository mining, relative to other classification methods listed in this study.

AB  - Approximations in rough sets theory are important operators to discover interesting patterns and dependencies in data mining. Both certain and uncertain rules are unraveled from different regions partitioned by approximations. In real-life applications, an information system may evolve with time by different factors such as attributes, objects, and attribute values. How to update approximations efficiently becomes vital in data mining related tasks. Dominance-based rough set approaches deal with the problem of ordinal classification with monotonicity constraints in multi-criteria decision analysis. Data missing frequently appears in the Incomplete Ordered Decision Systems (IODSs). Extended dominance characteristic relation-based rough set approaches process the IODS with two cases of missing data, i.e., “lost value” and “do not care”. This paper focuses on dynamically updating approximations of upward and downward unions while attribute values coarsening or refining in the IODS. Under the extended dominance characteristic relation based rough sets, it presents the principles of dynamically updating approximations w.r.t. attribute values’ coarsening and refining in the IODS and algorithms for incremental updating approximations of an upward union and downward union of classes. Comparative experiments from datasets of UCI and empirical results show the proposed method is efficient and effective in maintenance of approximations.

AB  - Infrastructure design is always a very complex task because of the many variables involved. Rail design, in particular, takes on considerable importance (together with the socioeconomic variables) among the environmental variables. The latter is a factor that contributes strongly to the definition of design choices. This paper proposes a method for optimizing the choice of the corridors/line of “high speed rail” (HRS). In particular, the method is based on “multi criteria analysis” with GIS support. The method was applied to a real case in order to evaluate its economic feasibility, social and environmental impact. We considered three possible corridors (conservative, compromise and innovative) for the construction of high-speed rail lines in an area located in the south of Italy The analysis performed gave the following results:.a conservative point of view: the better hypothesis was a corridor near the coast but more tortuous; this solution preserves the environment, but involves higher costs and greater “travel time”;an innovative point of view and a compromised point of view: the better hypothesis was a corridor crossing the territory in the central part (central park zone of great importance for the environment).In this case the corridor gives higher speeds and lower “travel times”; however for this solution the environmental components are jeopardized to a greater degree.

AB  - Lean production is a multi-dimensional approach composed of management activities, just-in-time, cellular manufacturing, supplier management, work teams, and quality systems, hence implementing lean production is time consuming and costly. Organizations must be able to measure the success possibility of implementing lean production before embarking on it. In this paper, artificial neural network model has been designed and trained using analytical hierarchy process named A2 which results in measuring the success of lean production implementation in an automobile company by determining the level of leanness. This approach leads to fewer calculations, faster and more accurate decision-making, less complexity, and the ability to analyze a lot of scenarios with only one or few judgments of decision makers while the effect of the subjective opinion of one single decision maker will be avoided. This proposed method is compared with the adaptive analytical hierarchy process approach which is suggested by Lin et al. in 2008 and is named A3. The implementation results show that these two methods are significantly valid for measuring the success of lean manufacturing by determining the level of leanness. Comparison of the two methods shows that although A3 has benefits, it also suffers from limitations, which can be avoided by the A2 model, A2 also improves the time and cost needed for implementing in comparison.

In recent terms, there exists web based or electronic service quality (e-sq) concept. With the birth of electronic commerce, it has become important to be able to monitor and enhance e-sq. Therefore, this study will examine the e-sq concept and determine the key components of e-sq. The e-sq framework is employed by the aid of service quality (SERVQUAL) methodology as the theoretical instrument. Finally, proposed e-sq framework is illustrated with a web service performance example of healthcare sector in Turkey by using a combined multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology containing fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The work presented in this paper shows the applicability of the e-sq framework in explaining the complexity of aspects observed in the implementation of healthcare services via internet.

Among numerous MCDA/MCDM methods developed to solve real-world decision problems, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) continues to work satisfactorily across different application areas. In this paper, we conduct a state-of-the-art literature survey to taxonomize the research on TOPSIS applications and methodologies. The classification scheme for this review contains 266 scholarly papers from 103 journals since the year 2000, separated into nine application areas: (1) Supply Chain Management and Logistics, (2) Design, Engineering and Manufacturing Systems, (3) Business and Marketing Management, (4) Health, Safety and Environment Management, (5) Human Resources Management, (6) Energy Management, (7) Chemical Engineering, (8) Water Resources Management and (9) Other topics. Scholarly papers in the TOPSIS discipline are further interpreted based on (1) publication year, (2) publication journal, (3) authors’ nationality and (4) other methods combined or compared with TOPSIS. We end our review paper with recommendations for future research in TOPSIS decision-making that is both forward-looking and practically oriented. This paper provides useful insights into the TOPSIS method and suggests a framework for future attempts in this area for academic researchers and practitioners.

Sustainable supplier selection as a crucial decision can affect the overall degree of sustainability in a supply chain. In this paper, an integrated approach of clustering and multi criteria decision making methods have been proposed in order to solve sustainable supplier selection problem. Firstly, self- organizing map as one of the well-known neural network methods has been utilized in order to cluster and prequalify the suppliers based on customer demand attribute and sustainability elements. Then, multi criteria decision making methods will be utilized in order to rank the cluster of suppliers to make coordination between them and customers. A case study has been carried out in order to show the efficiency of proposed approach.

AB  - Forecasting future color trend is a crucially important and challenging task in the fashion industry including design, production and sales. In particular, the trend of fashion color is highly volatile. Without advanced methods, it is very hard to make fashion color trend forecasting with reasonably high accuracy, and it is a handicap for development of the intelligent expert systems in fashion industry. As a result, many prior works have employed traditional regression models like ARIMA or intelligent models such as artificial neural network (ANN) and grey model (GM) for conducting color trend forecasting. However, the reported accuracies of these forecasting methods vary a lot, and there are controversies in the literature on these models’ performances. As a result, in this paper, we systematically compare the performances of ARIMA, ANN and GM models and their extended family methods. With real data analysis, our results show that the ANN family models, especially for Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), outperform the other models for forecasting fashion color trend.

A fuzzy multi-sensor data fusion Kalman model was used to help reduce IVHMS failure risk. The IVHMS was tested, and sensors with and without faults were identified. The results demonstrate that multi-sensor data fusion based on fault detection and fuzzy Kalman feedback is an effective method of reducing risk in an IVHMS. Use of the fuzzy Kalman filter approach reduced the time needed to perform complex matrix manipulations to control higher order systems in the IVHMS. Moreover, the approach was able to capture the nonlinearity of engine operations under the influence of various anomalies.

AB  - Consumer perception could play an important role in the adoption of renewable energy technologies. This study aims to explore the role of consumer acceptance and model its effect on residential photovoltaic (PV) adoption. A survey was conducted to understand consumer perceptions of the technology (perception variables), such as perceived cost, perceived maintenance requirement, and environmental concern. To further investigate the adoption potential of residential PV, this paper develops a fuzzy logic inference model to relate consumer perception variables (inputs to the model) to their purchasing probability (output from the model). This model is tested in a case study of residential PV adoption using data from a survey of homeowners in Arizona, United States. The quantitative results of the model demonstrate the role of each perception variable in the consumer acceptance of PV. Public has tended to emphasize on the role of cost reduction in promoting the adoption of residential PV. The results of this study show that other issues such as maintenance requirement and environmental concern are also important.

AB  - A variety of classification algorithms for software defect detection have been developed over the years. How to select an appropriate classifier for a given task is an important issue in Data mining and knowledge discovery (DMKD). Many studies have compared different types of classification algorithms and the performances of these algorithms may vary using different performance measures and under different circumstances. Since the algorithm selection task needs to examine several criteria, such as accuracy, computational time, and misclassification rate, it can be modeled as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. The goal of this paper is to use a set of MCDM methods to rank classification algorithms, with empirical results based on the software defect detection datasets. Since the preferences of the decision maker (DM) play an important role in algorithm evaluation and selection, this paper involved the DM during the ranking procedure by assigning user weights to the performance measures. Four MCDM methods are examined using 38 classification algorithms and 13 evaluation criteria over 10 public-domain software defect datasets. The results indicate that the boosting of CART and the boosting of C4.5 decision tree are ranked as the most appropriate algorithms for software defect datasets. Though the MCDM methods provide some conflicting results for the selected software defect datasets, they agree on most top-ranked classification algorithms.

AB  - It is well known that “green” principles and strategies have become vital for companies as the public awareness increased against their environmental impacts. A company’s environmental performance is not only related to the company’s inner environmental efforts, but also it is affected by the suppliers’ environmental performance and image. For industries, environmentally responsible manufacturing, return flows, and related processes require green supply chain (GSC) and accompanying suppliers with environmental/green competencies. During recent years, how to determine suitable and green suppliers in the supply chain has become a key strategic consideration. Therefore this paper examines GSC management (GSCM) and GSCM capability dimensions to propose an evaluation framework for green suppliers. However, the nature of supplier selection is a complex multi-criteria problem including both quantitative and qualitative factors which may be in conflict and may also be uncertain. The identified components are integrated into a novel hybrid fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) model combines the fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model (DEMATEL), the Analytical Network Process (ANP), and Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) in a fuzzy context. A case study is proposed for green supplier evaluation in a specific company, namely Ford Otosan.

AB  - This research aims to develop a skylight system that responds to both external, environmental conditions and adjustable internal functional demands. The system adapts to different geometries, uses, locations, times and sky conditions. In the design process, the disposition and size of skylights are customized to the context. After construction, the apertures of the skylights control interior conditions. This paper focuses on the dynamic process to control daylight using a case study. The goal is to assure adequate illuminance and low visual contrast. Parametric and environmental software analysis is used to generate and assess solutions. Heuristics strategies are developed to find adequate configurations, given that optimization methods are time and resource consuming. The performance of such configurations is evaluated in specific conditions. An interpolation method is proposed to find configurations adequate to other conditions. A friendly-interface allows selecting the best configuration in real-time using multi-criteria.

AB  - Multi-criteria decision support (MCDS) tools assist the decision maker (DM) in selecting an appropriate option among pre-specified alternatives. In forest management context, criteria based on existing and utilized forest resources are used to compare and contrast the alternatives. Typically only a small group of the available criteria is used in the analysis. Deciding upon which criteria are used to represent the economic, ecological and social sustainability might have an impact on the final selection among the forest plans. This study's primary objective is to examine if DMs derive similar decisions regarding forest management with a varying level of information provided, thus illustrating how critical it is to negotiate about the criteria set in advance. Fifty forest science students were used as testees, using a representative sized forest tract as a case “holding” which provided semi-authentic data. A series of decision scenarios tested how the decision changed with an increase in the amount of information. Results of a systematic examination show that slightly over half of the participants selected the same plan in at least 2 out of 3 scenarios. The results also suggest that the most important requirement for criteria selection is that they display the dimensions where the plans markedly differ.

AB  - This study presents a modeling approach that focuses on the identification of potential lead markets for electric-drive vehicles (EDVs) in Europe. It is based on a combination of several selected economic, social, environmental, and transport-related factors. The modeling approach is implemented in a GIS-based multi-criteria decision support process with fuzzy measures, enabling an assessment at different spatial and temporal scales under different EDV market penetration scenarios for Europe. The decision support system embeds a multi-criteria analysis based on selected expert-weighted market penetration drivers. The spatial scale chosen for the application of the decision support process are NUTS2 regions and cities within EU27 member states. Three scenarios are investigated, a business as usual, a moderate change, and an accelerated innovation scenario. Across the scenario horizon, it is shown how lead regions for EDVs will be changing in time between first early-adopter areas towards other long-term potential lead regions, depending on the evolution of the market drivers. The European regions and cities which will have a higher lead market potential score in 2020 and 2030 are identified. Our model solution suggests that with the business-as-usual scenario there will be a few insular lead market areas in 2020 and a relatively limited number of more connected lead regions in 2030. The other two scenarios explored suggest a more positive picture leading for the case of the 2030 accelerated scenario to a wide distribution of EDVs across most of Germany, the Netherlands, France, the UK, Ireland, and Italy. The cities of London, Madrid, Berlin and Rome would show high EDV sales under this scenario.

AB  - In many binary medical classification problems, the cost of misclassifying one category is higher than the other, and in these applications it is desirable to employ a classifier with selective sensitivity or specificity. This work explores the utility of a fuzzy multi–criteria function for performance evaluation during knowledge–based medical classification and prediction. The method presented here uses fuzzy optimization to combine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of classification as goals in a single objective function. This approach is used to assign flexible goals, which can be used to maximize the outcome in terms of each one of the goals. The proposed approach significantly increases the sensitivity and the specificity while maintaining or increasing accuracy. The versatility of the method is further exploited in a multi-model approach, using individual structures of multi-objective optimization of sensitivity and specificity separately, and then combining their outcomes through a decision-making module. Among various medical benefits derived from applying this technique, the divergent feature sets selected by high sensitivity and specificity models lend insight into factors more integrally connected to what causes risk of death for patients.

First the paper describes the main challenges to tackle current air pollution control, including economic aspects. Then it proposes a novel approach to manage the problem, presenting its mathematical formalization and describing its practical implementation into the Regional Integrated Assessment Tool (RIAT). The main features of the software system are described and some preliminary results on a domain in Northern Italy are illustrated. The novel features in RIAT are then compared to the state-of-the-art in integrated assessment of air quality, for example the ability to handle nonlinearities (instead of the usual linear approach) and the multi-objective framework (alternative to cost-effectiveness and scenario analysis). Then the lessons learned during the RIAT implementation are discussed, focusing on the locality, flexibility and openness of the tool. Finally the areas for further development of air quality integrated assessment are highlighted, with a focus on sensitivity analysis, structural and non technical measures, and the application of parallel computing concepts.

AB  - Tunneling industry has seen great advancements in underground construction projects. Now, it has significant difference with the last two decades. In many times, tunneling projects find themselves involved in the situation where unexpected conditions threaten the continuation of project. Managers always look for a reliable technique to overcome limitations of finance and time. TOPSIS method is widely used to solve multi criteria decision making (MADM) problems. This technique assigns the best alternative among a pool of feasible alternatives. Furthermore, due to inherent uncertainties in tunneling, using fuzzy logic in order to take into account these uncertainties can be useful. In addition, new factors are introduced to promote the accuracy of risk analysis. Finally, a real world case study is presented to show the effectiveness and the accuracy of the new risk evaluation model. The results demonstrated that collapse is the riskiest parameter in Ghomroud water conveyance tunneling project.

AB  - In system modeling, knowledge management comes vividly into the picture when dealing with a collection of individual models. These models being considered as sources of knowledge, are engaged in some collective pursuits of a collaborative development to establish modeling outcomes of global character. The result comes in the form of a so-called granular fuzzy model, which directly reflects upon and quantifies the diversity of the available sources of knowledge (local models) involved in knowledge management. In this study, several detailed algorithmic schemes are presented along with related computational aspects associated with Granular Computing. It is also shown how the construction of information granules completed through the use of the principle of justifiable granularity becomes advantageous in the realization of granular fuzzy models and a quantification of the quality (specificity) of the results of modeling. We focus on the design of granular fuzzy models considering that the locally available models are those fuzzy rule-based. It is shown that the model quantified in terms of two conflicting criteria, that is (a) a coverage criterion expressing to which extent the resulting information granules “cover” include data and (b) specificity criterion articulating how detailed (specific) the obtained information granules are. The overall quality of the granular model is also assessed by determining an area under curve (AUC) where the curve is formed in the coverage-specificity coordinates. Numeric results are discussed with intent of displaying the most essential features of the proposed methodology and algorithmic developments.

AB  - Supplier selection problem, considered as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, is one of the most important issues for firms. Lots of literatures about it have been emitted since 1960s. However, research on supplier selection under operational risks is limited. What’s more, the criteria used by most of them are independent, which usually does not correspond with the real world. Although the analytic network process (ANP) has been proposed to deal with the problems above, several problems make the method impractical. This study first integrates the fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) and fuzzy soft set model for solving the supplier selection problem. This method not only considers the dependent and feedback effect among criteria, but also considers the uncertainties on decision making process. Finally, a case study of supplier selection considering risk factors is given to demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness.

AB  - Demands on fresh water by human beings have been continuously increasing due to population growth, living standard improvement, and economic development. At the same time, many regions are suffering greatly from floods and droughts. Those are the results of ineffective management of water resources due to the associated complexities. In this study, a decision support system (DSS) was developed for supporting integrated water resources management in Daegu city, Republic of Korea. The developed DSS contained four subsystems including database, modelbase, and knowledgebase, as well as general user interface (GUI). It was then connected with the National Water Management Information System (WAMIS). A flow prediction could be conducted through the incorporated HEC-HMS Version 3.0.1. Also, an urban water demand forecasting model was developed using an artificial neural network (ANN) based model. At the same time, a water resources management model based on genetic algorithm (GA) was developed in the DSS, facilitating efficient allocation of water resources among different regions within a city. The result indicated that the developed DSS is very useful to deal with complex water resources management problems and could be further applied to similar cities in South Korea.

The obtained criticality level is used to rationalize the efficiency of the spare parts inventory policy. The model presents the multi-criteria classification problem in a logic decision diagram where AHP is used to solve the multi-criteria decision sub-problems at the different decision nodes of the diagram. The method was tested and implemented in a petrochemical plant and the results of this case study are presented.

AB  - With the ever increasing public awareness of complicated road safety phenomenon, much more detailed aspects of crash and injury causation rather than only crash data are extensively investigated in the current road safety research. Safety performance indicators (SPIs), which are causally related to the number of crashes or to the injury consequences of a crash, are rapidly developed and increasingly used. To measure the multi-dimensional concept of road safety which cannot be captured by a single indicator, the exploration of a composite road safety performance index is vital for rational decision-making about road safety. In doing so, a proper decision support system is required. In this study, we propose an improved hierarchical fuzzy TOPSIS model to combine the multilayer SPIs into one overall index by incorporating experts’ knowledge. Using the number of road fatalities per million inhabitants as a relevant reference, the proposed model provides with a promising intelligent decision support system to evaluate the road safety performance for a case study of a given set of European countries. It effectively handles experts’ linguistic expressions and takes the layered hierarchy of the indicators into account. The comparison results with those from the original hierarchical fuzzy TOPSIS model further verify the robustness of the proposed model, and imply the feasibility of applying this model to a great number of performance evaluation and decision making activities in other wide ranging fields as well.

AB  - Energy managers in public agencies are subject to multiple and sometimes conflicting policy objectives regarding cost, environmental, and security concerns associated with alternative energy technologies. Making infrastructure investment decisions requires balancing different distributions of risks and benefits that are far from clear. For example, managers at permanent Army installations must incorporate Congressional legislative objectives, executive orders, Department of Defense directives, state laws and regulations, local restrictions, and multiple stakeholder concerns when undertaking new energy initiatives. Moreover, uncertainty with regard to alternative energy technologies is typically much greater than that associated with traditional technologies, both because the technologies themselves are continuously evolving and because the intermittent nature of many renewable technologies makes a certain level of uncertainty irreducible. This paper describes a novel stochastic multi-attribute analytic approach that allows users to explore different priorities or weighting schemes in combination with uncertainties related to technology performance. To illustrate the utility of this approach for understanding conflicting policy or stakeholder perspectives, prioritizing the need for more information, and making investment decisions, we apply this approach to an energy technology decision problem representative of a permanent military base.

To design new sustainable products, which may have several important sustainability concerns refer to environment, economic and social aspects, selecting the highest sustainability index among the new products generated is a multi-criteria decision-making problem. This paper proposes an integrated approach for the decision-making problem that combines the Morphological Analysis (MA) and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The combination of both approaches enables product designers to widen design element concepts and evaluate the product sustainability at the early stage of product development process.

KW  - Decision support
KW  - Stakeholder participation
AB  - Sustainable Land Management (SLM) is a classic multi-stakeholder issue, concerning individual and community land users, agricultural advisors, natural resource managers, government authorities, civil society, and researchers alike. Selecting appropriate SLM technologies for implementation requires an approach capable of integrating the diverse knowledge, perceptions, and judgements of stakeholders. Time and resource constraints often impede the development of contextualised, targeted, and sophisticated Decision Support Systems (DSS). The EU-DESIRE research project provided an excellent opportunity to develop and test a generic decision support system, and overall methodology, using it to assist 14 study site teams in selecting the most promising SLM option(s) in a stakeholder workshop, for eventual test implementation in the field. Special attention was paid to screening local innovations, selecting and adapting potential SLM technologies, and the decision-making process regarding effective implementation. This paper reviews application of the DESIRE-DSS in a variety of biophysical and socio-economic contexts, finding it to be well structured, holistic, and relatively easy-to-apply. The built-in global database of SLM options provides knowledge from various environments, while the use of simple software enables easy calculation and visualisation of results. The scoring and negotiation of each option’s sustainability forces stakeholders to consider and acknowledge each other’s positions and opinions, ensuring that the final choice is well-accepted. The methodology includes seeking commitments from stakeholders to implement the selected option(s). Challenges include the complexity of the issues at hand and the need for capable moderators. Yet positive outcomes and user feedback confirm that the DESIRE-DSS is an easy-to-use stepwise methodology for facilitation of decision-focused participatory processes.

AB  - The inherent uncertainty and imprecision in project scheduling have motivated the proposal of several fuzzy set theory based extensions of activity network scheduling techniques. Building upon these, a cash flow calculation methodology for projects including activities with fuzzy durations and/or costs is proposed in this paper. According to the proposed approach, the project cash flow is represented by an S-surface (as opposed to the traditional S-curve) ensuing by connecting S-curves at different risk possibility levels. The methodology is exemplified by estimating the working capital requirements in a real world road construction project. Furthermore, the benefits of the methodology and its subsequent computerization are discussed. It is believed that the proposed approach may also be useful for both evaluating project proposals during feasibility studies and for performing earned value analysis for project monitoring and control.

AB  - Landfill site selection is a complicated multi criteria land use planning that should convince all related stakeholders with different insights. This paper addresses an integrating approach for landfill siting based on conflicting opinions among environmental, economical and socio-cultural expertise. In order to gain optimized siting decision, the issue was investigated in different viewpoints. At first step based on opinion sampling and questionnaire results of 35 experts familiar with local situations, the national environmental legislations and international practices, 13 constraints and 15 factors were built in hierarchical structure. Factors divided into three environmental, economical and socio-cultural groups. In the next step, the GIS-database was developed based on the designated criteria. In the third stage, the criteria standardization and criteria weighting were accomplished. The relative importance weights of criteria and subcriteria were estimated, respectively, using analytical hierarchy process and rank ordering methods based on different experts opinions. Thereafter, by using simple additive weighting method, the suitability maps for landfill siting in Marvdasht, Iran, was evaluated in environmental, economical and socio-cultural visions. The importance of each group of criteria in its own vision was assigned to be higher than two other groups. In the fourth stage, the final suitability map was obtained after crossing three resulted maps in different visions and reported in five suitability classes for landfill construction. This map indicated that almost 1224ha of the study area can be considered as best suitable class for landfill siting considering all visions. In the last stage, a comprehensive field visit was performed to verify the selected site obtained from the proposed model. This field inspection has confirmed the proposed integrating approach for the landfill siting.

Frequency ratio model was used to define the relationships between the coal occurrences and the selected variables which are significant for coal prospection. Formation, geologic age, lithology, rock types, depositional environment, distance to fault and slope data of the study area were used as variables. Frequency ratio values of the variables were calculated and assigned to variable's class attributes. All variable maps were summed according to the frequency ratio values of superposed pixels to calculate the probability index. The probability index values of the potential map were classified into five classes as very high, high, medium, low and very low probability areas. Finally, the potential map was compared with known coalfields in the Milas–Yatagan Basin and calculated distribution of the known coalfields on the probable areas.

AB  - An artificial neural network (ANN) model is used to forecast the annual and monthly solar irradiation in Morocco. Solar irradiation data are taken from the new Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM-SAF)-PVGIS database. The database represents a total of 12 years of data from 1998 to 2010. In this paper, the data are inferred using an ANN algorithm to establish a forward/reverse correspondence between the longitude, latitude, elevation and solar irradiation. Specifically, for the ANN model, a three-layered, back-propagation standard ANN classifier is considered consisting of three layers: input, hidden and output layer. The learning set consists of the normalised longitude, latitude, elevation and the normalised mean annual and monthly solar irradiation of 41 Moroccan sites. The testing set consists of patterns just represented by the input component, while the output component is left unknown and its value results from the ANN algorithm for that specific input. The results are given in the form of the annual and monthly maps. They indicate that the method could be used by researchers or engineers to provide helpful information for decision makers in terms of sites selection, design and planning of new solar plants.

AB  - Classification rule mining is the most sought out by users since they represent highly comprehensible form of knowledge. The rules are evaluated based on objective and subjective metrics. The user must be able to specify the properties of the rules. The rules discovered must have some of these properties to render them useful. These properties may be conflicting. Hence discovery of rules with specific properties is a multi objective optimization problem. Cultural Algorithm (CA) which derives from social structures, and which incorporates evolutionary systems and agents, and uses five knowledge sources (KS's) for the evolution process better suits the need for solving multi objective optimization problem. In the current study a cultural algorithm for classification rule mining is proposed for multi objective optimization of rules.

Different business excellence models considers slightly different factor with different weights, but a selected business model suggests same factor ratings for all types of Industrial units. The factor weights are very much necessary at two stages, one is for giving required importance while deploying TQM concept in an organization, second stage to understand the degree of business excellence achieved through TQM deployment. Hence the author has attempted to develop organization specific factors and factor ratings by considering business specific key performance indicators (KPIs) along with weighted ratings with the help of Analytical Hi erarchy Process (AHP).

AB  - This work presents a method for taking the decision of reengineering a production system, based upon fuzzy techniques. The main advantage of this method is, after authors' opinion, is the ease of its implementation together with the reduced time for gathering data and processing it. Multi-variable decision systems are usually based upon complicated mathematical methods and involved a large amount of data to be processed. The fuzzy approach presented here is based only on five input variables and one output variable. The data for the model are gathered by simple queries and quizzes. Human perception, the main point of fuzzy logic, is widely used here for gathering input data for the decision model.

AB  - Market segmentation is a core marketing concept that is conceptually simple to define and understand, but inherently a multi-criteria problem that is hard to measure and computationally difficult in many aspects. This paper reviews the development of market segmentation techniques and identifies the computational issues of the applications of market segmentation. A multidimensional unified framework for market segmentation is proposed based on the relationship among segmentation variables, data measures, and the multi-objective optimization techniques implemented. We conduct an empirical comparison of two prominent methods: a concomitant finite mixture model and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The result shows that the proposed framework helps to understand different segmentation models and solutions and to guide the development of new market segmentation solution techniques.

AB  - The problem of controlling a heating ventilating and air conditioning system in a single zone of a building is addressed. Its formulation is done in order to maintain acceptable thermal comfort for the occupants and to spend the least possible energy to achieve that. In most operating conditions these are conflicting goals, which require some sort of optimisation method to find appropriate solutions over time. In this work a model based predictive control methodology is proposed. It consists of three major components: the predictive models, implemented by radial basis function neural networks identified by means of a multi-objective genetic algorithm; the cost function that will be optimised to minimise energy consumption and provide adequate thermal comfort; and finally the optimisation method, in this case a discrete branch and bound approach. Each component will be described, and experimental results obtained within a classroom will be presented, demonstrating the feasibility and performance of the approach.

AB  - System-level computer architecture simulations create large volumes of simulation data to explore alternative architectural solutions. Interpreting and drawing conclusions from this amount of simulation results can be extremely cumbersome. In other domains that also struggle with interpreting large volumes of data, such as scientific computing, data visualization is an invaluable tool. Such visualization is often domain specific and has not become widely studied and utilized for evaluating the results of computer architecture simulations. In this paper, we introduce our novel interactive visualization tool, called VMODEX, which is developed to support system-level design space exploration of MPSoC architectures. In our tool, the design space is modeled as a tree in which both the design parameters and criteria are shown in a single view. VMODEX is able to handle large design spaces and allows designers to look at the data from different perspectives and at multiple levels of abstraction. Due to the exponential design space in real problems and multiple criteria to be considered, heuristic searching algorithms are often used to trim down a large design space into a finite set of points and provide the designer a set of tradable solutions with respect to the design criteria. In VMODEX, besides the techniques provided for visualizing the DSE results, additional capabilities are developed to understand the dynamic search behavior of heuristic searching algorithms.

AB  - Linguistic rules in natural language are useful and consistent with human way of thinking. They are very important in multi-criteria decision making due to their interpretability. In this paper, our discussions concentrate on extracting linguistic rules from data sets. In the end, we firstly analyze how to extract complex linguistic data summaries based on fuzzy logic. Then, we formalize linguistic rules based on complex linguistic data summaries, in which, the degree of confidence of linguistic rules from a data set can be explained by linguistic quantifiers and its linguistic truth from the fuzzy logical point of view. In order to obtain a linguistic rule with a higher degree of linguistic truth, a genetic algorithm is used to optimize the number and parameters of membership functions of linguistic values. Computational results show that the proposed method is an alternative method for extracting linguistic rules with linguistic truth from data sets.

AB  - This paper attempts to study the scheduling scheme in emergency resource center. The scheduling engineering in resource center can be divided into two stages: the normal stage and emergency stage. In the normal stage, orders come brokenly to the resource center in small number, and the order seldom has emergency requirement. In contrast, a large number of orders, which always have different emergency requirements, reach the resource center in a very short time. This paper analyzes the differences between the normal stage and emergency stage, and proposes the corresponding scheduling methods of two stages. In order to feed the different emergency requirements of orders, various weights are given to different orders. A polynomial algorithm is proposed to minimize the weighted makespan of emergency resource scheduling. Furthermore, a dynamic algorithm is designed to solve the dynamic emergency scheduling.

AB  - Many of the current Quality of Service (QoS) based web service selection systems assume that users will formulate QoS queries accurately. However, this may not always be the case. It would be helpful if users could browse through the QoS data of the service repository before they start the searching process. In this way, they could know what the actual QoS value distributions are, so that they could put down reasonable numbers in their QoS queries. The browsing process performed on QoS queries, on the other hand, could help service providers understand the actual QoS demands from users. In this paper, we propose to use the Scatter/Gather model—a well-known browsing model for large document collections, to implement QoS browsing. We modified the original model to make it fit QoS data and implemented a few variations of the model. We tested and compared performance on both synthetic and real QoS datasets, mainly focusing on the ability to handle real time interaction with users while balancing efficiency and accuracy.

AB  - Selecting an appropriate contractor is essential for the success of any construction project. Contractor prequalification procedure makes it possible to admit for tendering only competent contractor. Prequalification is a multi-criteria decision problem that is, in essence, largely dependent on the uncertainty and vagueness in the nature of construction projects and subjective judgement of the decision maker. This paper presents a systematic prequalification procedure, based on Fuzzy Set Theory, whose main differences and advantages in comparison with other models are the use of an algorithm to handle the inconsistencies in the fuzzy preference relation when pair-wise comparison judgements are used and the use of linguistic assessment or exact assessment of performance of the contractors on qualitative or quantitative criterion, respectively. Finally, a case study for the rehabilitation project of a building at Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena is presented to illustrate the use of the proposed model and to demonstrate its effectiveness.

AB  - Software measurement is a software engineering discipline which deals in quantifying the characteristics of a software product or software process. The measurement of the characteristics of software refers to the comparative study of the same and hence the quality of the software comes into picture. There are software quality models made for quantifying various quality parameters such as Boehm's Model, McCall's Model, and ISO/IEC 9126 Model etc but none of these give quantification of quality parameters. Hence this paper proposes a methodology for comparing different software solutions based on the SRS to a common problem. Software quality is highly unpredictable, it is the existence of desirable characteristics in a solution, while the desired attributes differ with different view point and are highly interdependent. Therefore Choquet Integral is used to efficiently compare the set of solutions to be implemented for software.

AB  - Constructing and improving urban residential areas is an eternal critical subject in the process of the whole urban development which is connected with a series of challenges and problems. During the past decades, urban residential development has speed up extremely with massive population mobility in cities. The purpose of this study is to propose an integrated approach for sustainability assessment of urban residential development, considering sustainability indicators, housing equilibrium and building visualization. Firstly based on merging DPSIR (Driving Forces, Pressure, State, Impact and Response) framework and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the indicators were systematized for the sustainability modeling. Due to the urban activities cause impacts not only on local level but also a broader scale, a simulation model, using System Dynamics (SD) methodology, was structured to quantitatively investigate the developmental tendency of the indicators. And then the estimated results were displayed in 2D density maps in ArcGIS and 3D visualization in CityEngine. A real case study was presented for the Stuttgart Region of the state of Baden-Württemberg in Southern Germany and its Plieningen district to experience the usefulness and feasibility of the developed approach. The integration of GIS, SD model and 3D visualization, called GISSD system here, can better explain the interaction and the variation of the sustainability indicators for residential development. Hence it is able to support the Decision Maker to view the sustainable level of urban residential areas more comprehensively.

AB  - Material selection is an important task because large numbers of competitive materials are available for various technological applications. Numerous material selection techniques are reported whereas most of the techniques are knowledge based and require performance indices for material selection. In this context, Ashby approach is one of the efficient methods which rely on performance indices of materials in specific application. However Multiple attribute decision making (MADM) approaches do not require exact physical relation for material selection. We have investigated micro-electromechanical system’s (MEMS) material selection using MADM approaches and compared their results with that of Ashby approach. Almost similar materials ranking indicates that MADM approaches are also efficient and ease to apply without any prior mathematical calculation for materials properties-application relation.

AB  - NoGo is similar to the game of Go in terms of gameplay; however, the goal is different: the first player who either suicides or kills a group loses the game and the first player with no legal move loses the game. In this paper, we propose an approach combining the technologies of ontologies, evolutionary computation, fuzzy logic, and fuzzy markup language (FML) with a genetic algorithm (GA)-based system for the NoGo game. Based on the collected patterns and the pre-constructed fuzzy NoGo ontology, the genetic FML (GFML) with the fuzzy inference mechanism is able to analyze the situation of the current game board and then play next move to an inferred good-move position. Additionally, the genetic learning mechanism continuously evolves the adopted GFMLs to enable an increase in the winning rate of the GA-based NoGo via playing with the baseline NoGo. In the proposed approach, first, the domain experts construct the important NoGo patterns and the fuzzy NoGo ontology based on the rules of NoGo and the past game records. Second, each GA-based NoGo as White plays against the baseline NoGo as Black according to the inferred and calculated good-move position, respectively. Third, the genetic learning mechanism is carried out to generate two new evolved GFMLs and then the worst two GFMLs stored in the GFML repository are replaced. Fourth, the GFML with the highest winning rate is randomly sampled from the GFML repository in the time series. Finally, one by one the GA-based NoGo adopts the sampled GFML to play lots of games against the baseline NoGo to obtain the winning rate of the GA-based NoGo. The acquired winning rates at the time series show that the proposed approach can work effectively and that the average winning rate of the GA-based NoGo program is much stronger than the baseline NoGo program.

AB  - Polymer composites with different mechanical properties can be produced from various polymer matrices and reinforcing materials by different plastic molding technologies. Thus numerous combinatorial ways exist for production of polymer composites. Because of this complexity, the elaboration of an evolving knowledge base is necessary for the effective process design of composites with the required properties. The elaborated model is based on the experimental and expert databases. The experimental database contains the summarized results of our experiments for polymer composite production in the last five years. In the expert database the compatibility relations among the properties are described, based on literature data and on the experts’ opinions. Determined by the appropriate searching criteria, the system generates recommendations for the production of polymer composites with determined properties, from the above described knowledge bases. Based on the recommendations of the model, composites of similar properties can be produced from different raw materials (polymers and reinforcements) that help to reduce the production costs.

AB  - This study describes a causal knowledge-based expert system for planning an Internet-based stock trading system, abbreviated CAKES-ISTS. The case base of this system consists of the qualities that promote ISTS use, two specific facets of ISTS use (stock amount purchased and frequency of use), and user satisfaction. Planning ISTS requires consideration of the complex causal relationships between system qualities, system use, and performance (i.e., user satisfaction). This study also examines the factors affecting the level of system usage and performance. First, this study uses a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) to develop the causal knowledge base of the expert system for ISTS planning. Second, this study uses structural equation modeling to estimate the relevant relationships among FCM components as well as their direction and strength. Third, this study develops rules based on system qualities to predict the usage and performance level of ISTS, allowing the identification of the qualities essential to enhance system usage and performance. This clearly shows how effective ISTS planning is possible through the inference process provided by CAKES-ISTS.

AB  - The development of interactive map websites increases the need of efficient automatic cartographic generalisation. The generalisation process, which aims at decreasing the level of details of geographic data in order to produce a map at a given scale, is extremely complex. A classical method for automating the generalisation process consists in using a heuristic tree-search strategy. This type of strategy requires having high quality control knowledge (heuristics) to guide the search for the optimal solution. Unfortunately, this control knowledge is rarely perfect and its evaluation is often difficult. Yet, this evaluation can be very useful to manage knowledge and to determine when to revise it. The objective of our work is to offer an automatic method for evaluating the quality of control knowledge for cartographic generalisation based on a heuristic tree-search strategy. Our diagnosis method consists in analysing the system’s execution logs, and in using a multi-criteria analysis method for evaluating the knowledge global quality. We present an industrial application as a case study using this method for building block generalisation and this experiment shows promising results.

AB  - This paper describes the development of ad hoc methodology for determination of inorganic anions in oilfield water, since their composition often significantly differs from the average (concentration of components and/or matrix). Therefore, fast and reliable method development has to be performed in order to ensure the monitoring of desired properties under new conditions. The method development was based on computer assisted multi-criteria decision making strategy. The used criteria were: maximal value of objective functions used, maximal robustness of the separation method, minimal analysis time, and maximal retention distance between two nearest components. Artificial neural networks were used for modeling of anion retention. The reliability of developed method was extensively tested by the validation of performance characteristics. Based on validation results, the developed method shows satisfactory performance characteristics, proving the successful application of computer assisted methodology in the described case study.

With determination of priorities for these criteria through questionnaire and AHP method, the overall rank of these criteria that have the most influence on distribution of energy subsidy among socio-economic sub-sectors, are as the following: inflation, economic growth, labor intensity, distribution of energy subsidy among socio-economic levels, energy intensity and social cost of air pollution. According to the model, the first priority for allocation of energy subsidy is commercial sector and the last priority is related to transportation sector. Investigating the impact of changing priority of the criteria on overall results indicates that the socio-economic sub sectors’ ranking in receiving subsidy have little sensitivity for changing priority of the subsidy criteria.

The stacking sequence of fibres has a dramatic influence on the strength of multilayered composite plates. Multiple layers of fibre-reinforced material systems offer versatility in engineering material design due to the fact that the stacking sequence of each orthotropic layer can offer full advantage of superior mechanical properties. Numerical results show that the optimal composite structures have lower weight, higher stiffness and also affordable cost when compared to the extreme and intermediate composite structures. In addition, the benefits of using a parallel optimisation system are also presented.

Various raster-based evidential layers involving geological, geophysical, and geochemical geo-datasets are integrated to prepare a mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM). In a case study, thirteen layers of the Now Chun copper deposit located in the Kerman province of Iran are used to explore the region of interest. The PROMETHEE II technique is applied to produce the desired MPM, and the outputs are validated using twenty-one boreholes that have been classified into five classes. This proposed method shows a high performance when providing the MPM while reducing the cost of exploratory drilling in the study area.

AB  - Industries nowadays have more insight into corporate environmental, social and economic sustainability than ever before. Sustainability issues in various industries are all about choices – finding ways to be more strategic and reducing waste and energy, while benefiting the bottom line. Because of the complexity of sustainability decisions and strategies, these insights call for applying advanced control techniques. In this article we review the concepts of sustainability and its practical issues, specifically focusing on the issues of supply networks. Sustainability issues are usually complex because beyond their inherent challenges, there are conflicts among stakeholders within organizations and between organizations; hence, more useful methods are required for effective solutions. We consider Decision Support Systems (DSSs) to help optimize solutions related with sustainability issues, and review their concepts and usefulness based on previous work. We also suggest strategies applying the Collaborative Control Theory (CCT) principles to augment DSS by a new Sustainability – Decision Support Protocol (S-DSP) in order to overcome certain weaknesses. To model and illustrate the benefit of S-DSP as a control protocol, two practical supply delivery/production problems are analyzed. The results highlight how better collaborative solutions can be achieved to maximize the sustainability of supply networks. It is envisioned that sustainability decision support by such cyber-supported collaboration protocols will contribute to overcome the emerging challenges of sustainability planning and control.

AB  - With the differences of customization attributes, the changes of the implementing stages of rules and different selling countries, the contents of the check value of RoHS (Restriction of the use of certain Hazardous Substance in electrical and electronic equipment) which each enterprise has to comply with and which is more complicated than component selection operation for general products are different. Under such complicated productive production, it is a major test for business decision makers to maintain the most effective operational efficiency and the lowest cost. This study puts forward a set of solutions which integrate group technology and neural network against component selection of green supply chain management (GSCM). First, neural networks are used for grouping products with the similar customized need against the value of the check item of each part of orders. Next, according to the information of existing inventory within the enterprise, available parts are selected and the total production costs are calculated to effectively reduce the complexity of the planning of the production lines for production manager. The above operation mode is established to be an information system of a component selection for green supply chain. Finally, data is analyzed to account for the using situation to ensure the availability of practical operation of the system based on the case of a company.

KW  - Possibilistic regression

KW  - Interval linear regression
AB  - In interval linear regression analysis, we are given crisp or interval data and we are to determine appropriate interval regression parameters. There are various methods for interval regression; many of them possess the property that while some of the resulting interval regression parameters are very wide, the other parameters are crisp. This drawback is the main limiting factor for such methods and much effort has been devoted to overcoming it. We propose a method motivated by tolerance analysis in linear systems. Our method yields intervals for regression parameters the widths of which are proportional to an in-advance given vector of parameters. Moreover, the method is computationally very cheap, and provides a natural measure of quality of a model. First we formulate the method for the basic model of crisp input–crisp output data and then extend it to crisp input–interval output and interval input–interval output models. For the interval-valued cases we study several formulations of the solution concept: possibility, strong possibility, weak possibility, necessity. Here, strong possibility is a new concept proposed as a natural counterpart to the remaining ones. We prove that the method provides optimal interval parameters meeting centrality and proportionality requirements. We also show that the method provides interval regression parameters satisfying various versions of Tanaka–Lee's inclusion property. We also derive a form of a complementarity theorem for the weak possibility and necessity solution concepts. Since practical problems may be affected by outlying observations we show that our approach is easily adapted to deal with them. We illustrate the theory by examples.

AB  - Many real world applications consist of finding optimal inputs (design variables) to the system that yields in desirable values for stochastic outputs (Responses). Several studies in the literature have suggested approaches addressing these problems but most of them assume that the responses are independent and their variances are constant over the experimental space. Furthermore, in many situations the relationship between the response variables and design variables is too complex to be efficiently estimated using traditional surface fitting approaches. In this paper, a method is presented for optimizing the problem of correlated multiple responses where relationship among response and design variables is highly nonlinear by means of Neuro-Fuzzy and principal component analysis derived desirability function. As another advantage over existing works, we have relaxed the assumption that variance of each response is invariant over the feasible region. Finally, effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through a numerical example.

AB  - One of the most crucial stages in the new service development (NSD) process is concept selection, which is characterized by newly generated alternatives and vaguely defined concept evaluation criteria. Although a number of factors have been found to be influential, a lacuna remains as to how to make a strategic decision based on influential factors. This study proposes a systematic approach to evaluation of new service concepts (NSCs) by integrating the merit of group analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in modeling multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems and the strength of rough set theory (RST) in handling subjectivity in concept evaluation. The suggested approach is designed to be executed in four discrete stages. First of all, a hierarchical AHP model for the evaluation of NSCs is constructed in terms of strategy, finance, market, technology, and implementation. Second, pairwise comparisons are made among criteria and sub-criteria, and preferences to NSCs with respect to the sub-criteria are obtained by domain experts. Third, the individual judgments obtained at the preceding stage are aggregated into group judgments. Finally, the NSCs are prioritized based on risk propensity of decision makers. A case study of the video game service is presented to illustrate the suggested approach. We believe that our method can promote consensus building on the promising NSCs.

AB  - One of the main factors of land use change (LUC) modeling is the land use intersection (LUI) or neighborhood effect, which is normally modeled using cellular automata (CA) concept. The effects of LUI over distance are represented in terms of CA transition rules. In this paper, a new model for LUI process is developed that makes use of expert knowledge to define the transition rules. In this model, the region of influence is defined using a new radial structure; the transition rules are described by expert knowledge and spatial metrics in the form of linguistic variables; and finally, the neighborhood effect is classified into three groups of compactness, dependency and incompatibility. The model is implemented and evaluated using the data of Borkhar and Meymeh township, in Esfahan, Iran, for the two periods of 1986–1998 and 1998–2005. The results show that the model and its related concept are performing rather well.

AB  - Shared decision making (SDM) is an approach in which doctor–patient communication regarding available evidence and patient preferences is facilitated to enable the patient to participate in treatment decisions. SDM affords not only the inclusion of the ethical diversities involved in patient-centered care, but also the quality improvements in decision-making process. Though SDM has been studied extensively, there have been few practical implementations in real clinical environments. In this paper, we propose a shared decision-making system with its focus on dental restorative treatment planning. In our system, restorative treatment alternatives for SDM were generated by employing an ontology that had captured the clinical knowledge required for treatments. We considered patient preferences for treatment as an important support for mutual agreements between the patient and the doctor on healthcare decisions. We constructed a consistent and robust hierarchy of preferences using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, to help determine treatment priorities. On the basis of our proposed system, we developed a Web-based application for the visualization of evidence-based treatment recommendations with preference-based weights. We tested our system using a scenario to illustrate how doctors and patients can make shared decisions. The application is of high value in supporting SDM between doctors and patients, and expedites effective treatments and enhanced patient satisfaction.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problem with incomplete attribute weight information under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) environment. Firstly, we propose a new axiomatic definition of the entropy on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) and a method to construct a set of entropies on IVIFSs. Secondly, we construct a decision making model based on aggregation operator and distance measures to solve the MAGDM problem under IVIF environment. In this model, we propose a method based on linear programming methodology using an accuracy function to choose the attribute weights for the decision making problem with partially known attribute weight information, and a method based on IVIF entropy to choose the attribute weights for the decision making problem with unknown attribute weight information. Finally, two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the newly proposed MAGDM method by comparing it with other fuzzy MAGDM methods.

AB  - Manufacturing organisations started recognising the importance of sustainability concepts: This is due to increasing government regulations and the consciousness of the sustainable products among the customers. In general, the sustainability concepts are classified into economic, environment and social perspectives. The classification of sustainable concept concerning to manufacturing firms can be material oriented, product design oriented and manufacturing process oriented. Sustainable concept selection is a vital problem for the contemporary manufacturing organisations. The selection process includes multiple criteria, therefore a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method namely, PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organisational Method for Enrichment Evaluation) is used in the study to select the best sustainable concept considering the criteria from social, economical and natural perspectives. The study revealed that the change of material as the best orientation and it implies that the material should be done at the first stage to achieve sustainability in the case organisation.

AB  - This paper proposes a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM)-based framework to address two fundamental issues in cluster validation: 1) evaluation of clustering algorithms and 2) estimation of the optimal cluster number for a given data set. Since both issues involve more than one criterion, they can be modeled as multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems. The proposed framework is examined by an experimental study. The results suggest that MCDM methods are practical tools for the evaluation of clustering algorithms. In addition, the selected MCDM method, PROMETHEE II can estimate the optimal numbers of clusters for ten out of fifteen datasets by adjusting the weights of criteria.
