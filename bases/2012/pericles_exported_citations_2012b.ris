N2  - SummaryIn the design process of computer systems or processor architectures, typically many different parameters are exposed to configure, tune, and optimize every component of a system. For evaluations and before production, it is desirable to know the best setting for all parameters. Processing speed is no longer the only objective that needs to be optimized; power consumption, area, and so on have become very important. Thus, the best configurations have to be found in respect to multiple objectives. In this article, we use a multi-objective design space exploration tool called Framework for Automatic Design Space Exploration (FADSE) to automatically find near-optimal configurations in the vast design space of a processor architecture together with a tool for code optimizations and hence evaluate both automatically. As example, we use the Grid ALU Processor (GAP) and its postlink optimizer called GAPtimize, which can apply feedback-directed and platform-specific code optimizations. Our results show that FADSE is able to cope with both design spaces. Less than 25% of the maximal reasonable hardware effort for the scalable elements of the GAP is enough to achieve the processor's performance maximum. With a performance reduction tolerance of 10%, the necessary hardware complexity can be further reduced by about two-thirds. The found high-quality configurations are analyzed, exhibiting strong relationships between the parameters of the GAP, the distribution of complexity, and the total performance. These performance numbers can be improved by applying code optimizations concurrently to optimizing the hardware parameters. FADSE can find near-optimal configurations by effectively combining and selecting parameters for hardware and code optimizations in a short time. The maximum observed speedup is 15%. With the use of code optimizations, the maximum possible reduction of the hardware resources, while sustaining the same performance level, is 50%.Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - ABSTRACT Selection of new geographies in which to expand is a key decision for businesses aspiring to go beyond the opportunities in the existing markets. The conventional approaches of market selection can only provide a set of systematic steps for problem solving without considering the relationships between the decision factors. Decision models based on statistical techniques are able to examine the relationship between decision factors but are unable to effectively assist decision makers in identifying the most promising market, particularly in terms of prioritizing across decision factors. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a commonly used approach for choosing alternatives by prioritizing across multiple decision factors. The typical AHP modelling requires knowledge of criteria and/or alternatives along with their relative weights, generally elicited from field experts. Quite often, firms encounter situations where decision makers are aware of only the overall objective and a set of earmarked geographies for setting up market locations while being relatively unaware of decision criteria and relative weights. This precludes using AHP to identify promising market locations. This paper conceptualizes a market selection decision model that integrates AHP with statistical modelling techniques to identify the attractive market locations for the purpose of expansion. The model first uses principal component analysis and multiple regression to determine significant decision criteria and their weights. Thereafter, it applies AHP to prioritize the market locations across the decision criteria. This integrative approach is illustrated for identifying the attractive locations in rural markets for a steel firm in India. The major advantage of this approach is that unlike the existing models, it works in situations when firms have not enough knowledge about factors for evaluating alternative market locations. Another key advantage of the proposed model is that of economizing resources for data collection on variables representing decision factors. Copyright ? 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - AbstractA major drawback associated with the use of classical statistical methods for business failure prediction on top of financial distress is their lack of high accuracy rate. This work analyses the use of the two-stage ensemble of multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) and logit to improve predictive performance of classical statistical methods. All possible ratios are firstly built from the quantities involved and then the three common filters, that is stepwise MDA, stepwise logit, and t-test, are used to choose another three convenient subsets of ratios. Four principal components spaces (PCSs) are, respectively, produced on the four different feature spaces by using principal components analysis. MDA and logit are used to produce predictions on the four PCSs. After that, two levels of ensemble are implemented: one based on predictions inside each of the same type of model (i.e. MDA or logit) and another based on the former two ensembles and one best model. Each of the eight models is weighted on the base of ranking order information of its predictive accuracy in ensemble by majority voting. MDA and logit and the new challenge model of support vector machine respectively in their best standalone modes are used for comparisons. Empirical results indicate that the two-stage ensemble of MDA and logit compares favourably with the three comparative models and all its component models.

N2  - AbstractThis paper explores the effects of the correlation model, the trend model, and the number of training points on the accuracy of Kriging metamodels. Gaussian correlation models are found to be superior to exponential and linear correlation models. No particular trend model is found to be better than the other models. The number of training points used in constructing the Kriging metamodels is observed to change the relative performances of the trend and the correlation functions. The leave-one-out cross-validation error is found to become a better surrogate for the actual error, as the number of training points is increased. Finally, the use of an ensemble of metamodels is discussed and it is found that using an ensemble may improve the accuracy.

N2  - Abstract The selection of skilful players is a complicated process due to the problem criteria consisting of both qualitative and quantitative attributes as well as vague linguistic terms. This study seeks to develop a decision support framework for the selection of candidates eligible to become basketball players through the use of a fuzzy multi-attribute decision making (MADM) algorithm. The proposed model is based on fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods. The model was employed in the Youth and Sports Center of Mugla, Turkey, with the participation of seven junior basketball players aged between 7 and 14. In the present study, physical fitness measurement values and observation values of technical skills were utilized. FAHP was used to determine the weights of the criteria and the observation values of technical skills by decision makers. Physical fitness measurement values were converted to fuzzy values by using a fuzzy set approach. Subsequently, the overall ranking of the candidate players was determined by the TOPSIS method. Results were compared with human experts? opinions. It is observed that the developed model is more reliable to be used in decision making. The model architecture and experimental results along with illustrative examples are further demonstrated in the study.

N2  - ABSTRACT We draw on extant literature on strategic sourcing and supply base rationalization to anchor our argument that measuring supplier performance diversity is germane to executing an effective supply base rationalization strategy. We explicate how a novel approach to data envelopment analysis (DEA) efficiency assessment can be utilized to measure this performance diversity. More specifically, our methods are anchored in cross efficiency analysis in DEA that allows for evaluating the efficiency of a supplier with respect to the optimal weights (strengths) of its peers. This methodology is applied to an actual supplier dataset of a large multinational telecommunications company in categorizing their supply base into groups for effective supplier rationalization. We conclude that measuring and analyzing the performance diversity within the framework of DEA provides a mechanism for firms to better balance a rationalized and diversified supply base with unique skills.

N2  - Abstract In this paper, we propose a road traffic control method for reducing traffic congestion with a genetic algorithm. In the not too distant future, a system which controls the routes of all vehicles in a certain area must be realized. The system should optimize the routes of all vehicles, but the solution space of this problem is enormous. Therefore, we apply the genetic algorithm to this problem by encoding the route of all vehicles to a fixed length chromosome. To improve the search performance, a new genetic operator called ?path shortening? is also designed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown experimentally. ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Abstract The paper presents an approach to spatially representative depiction for assessing the vulnerability of central Iran's Zayandeh-Rood river basin to drought using multiple indicators. Drought conditions prevailed in the study basin from 2002 to 2007, with an annual rainfall deficiency of 45 to 55%. Multi-attribute decision making (MADM) methods develop a framework to evaluate the relative priorities of drought assessment based on a set of preferences, criteria and indicators. The proposed MADM process uses well-known techniques for product weights analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and order preference (TOPSIS). These indicators include the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), water demand, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Groundwater Balance and Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI). Indicators' spatial information was categorised in layers prepared in the spatial domain using a geographic information system (GIS). The alternatives were ranked and presented using TOPSIS. Results show that the proposed method was highly effective in representing assessments of drought vulnerability.

N2  - Abstract A major challenge in the assessment of medicines, treatment options, etc., is to establish a framework for the comparison of risks and benefits of many different types and magnitudes, a framework that at the same time allows a clear distinction between the roles played by the statistical analyses of data and by judgements based on personal experience and expertise. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate how clinical data can be weighted, scored and presented by the use of an eight-step data-driven benefit?risk assessment method, where two genetic profiles are compared. Our aim was to present a comprehensive approach that is simple to apply, allows direct comparison of different types of risks and benefits, quantifies the clinical relevance of data and is tailored for the comparison of different options. We analysed a cohort of 302 patients with colorectal cancer treated with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). Endpoints were cure rate, survival rate, time-to-death (TTD), time-to-relapse (TTR) and main adverse drug reactions. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was used to identify genetic interaction profiles associated with outcome. We have been able to demonstrate that a specific MDR-derived combination (the MDR-1 group) of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and thymidylate synthase polymorphisms is associated with increased and clinically significant difference for cure and survival rates, TTD and probably also for TTR, which are seen as the most important endpoints. An inferior profile was observed for severe myocardial ischaemia. A probably inferior profile was seen for severe arthralgia/myalgia and severe infections. A clear superior profile was seen for severe mucositis/stomatitis. The proposed approach offers comprehensive, data-driven assessment that can facilitate decision processes, for example, in a clinical setting. It employs descriptive statistical methods to highlight the clinically relevant differences between options.

N2  - Summary This chapter focuses on the necessary details in the context of combat modeling and distributed simulation for engineers. It discusses with an overview of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)?s Research and Technology Organization (RTO). The chapters of the Code of Best Practice (COBP) follow the recommended phases of an operational study using the means of operations research including combat modeling and potentially distributed simulation, which are the initialization phase; the preparation phase; and the execution, evaluation, and assessment phase. Starting with the sponsor?s problem, the initialization phase provides best practices for the problem formulation and the solution strategy. The chapter addresses these phases and sub-phases in more detail, allowing the application of the best practices recommended by NATO as one of the guiding engineering principles for combat modeling and distributed simulation.

N2  - Abstract The risk ranking exercises related to biological hazards undertaken in fourteen risk assessments of the EFSA/BIOHAZ Panel were reviewed. The aim was to suggest risk ranking tools to be used in future risk assessments and to analyse strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to risk ranking. It was concluded that there is no universal methodology for risk ranking. A conceptual risk ranking framework with nine separate stages is proposed to allow the adoption of the appropriate risk ranking methodology at each stage. Further, nine risk ranking tools developed by other institutions worldwide were described, although none of these could be recommended as the single risk ranking tool for the BIOHAZ Panel. It is recommended that the risk ranking exercise should take a structured approach and be transparently and consistently documented so to be reproducible. The importance of the proper correspondence between the time frame and the requirements of the risk ranking exercise was stressed as well as the interaction between the risk managers and the risk assessors in the definition of the risk ranking purpose and the presentation of the results. Furthermore the development of a risk ranking toolbox based on the proposed framework should be investigated, since such a toolbox would support the construction of consistent and transparent risk ranking models.
