AB  - Hydrogen (H2) explosion effects recently examined, are confirming the devastating loss scenarios to humans, environment, assets, and associated business interruption. H2 production is a core process in refineries used in further process steps. Steam reforming of natural gas or a mix with naphtha or LPG is a common hydrogen production technique, where the latest technologies have adopted enhanced metallurgies to minimize explosion risk and the associated maintenance cost following plant degradation owing to corrosion effects. However, corrosion rates are still high in specific areas of piping and process equipment. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology based on semi-quantitative RBI modeling according to regulations by API and recent EN standards, adopting a family of linear regression forecasting models that depict the yearly corrosion rate (per corrosion loop) of a hydrogen production steam reforming unit; this is done under different operating conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, and fluid speed), metallurgy and other related physicochemical variables. The model is based on the examination of both ultrasonic wall thinning measurements and the examination of quantitative crosslinking total corrosion effects along with the physicochemical properties prevailing in different plant corrosion loops. The outcome of the regression analysis is an expansive family of multivariable equations describing, with a defined accuracy, the yearly corrosion rate and associated lifespan forecast per corrosion loop, and per examined part. These equations were further utilized in a custom-made database that can be used as an additional loss prevention tool by the hydrogen production unit management team. Evaluation results regarding the tool efficiency are presented in the following of this paper.

AB  - Over the last thirty years, several techniques of groundwater (GW) remediation based on the principles of physical (air sparging), biological (bioventing), and chemical (e.g., ion exchange) processes have proven to be effective; however, only a handful of them could successfully be implemented at a community or regional scale due to issues like longevity, a requirement of significant investment and operation cost, skilled labours, and others. Therefore, considering the scope of Permeable Reactive Barriers (PRBs) to be implemented on a regional scale and its capability to be a significant replacement for several existing GW treatment methods, this review was prepared with the following objectives: (i) to compare the PRB method with the conventional methods of groundwater treatment along with the possibility and problems associated with the PRB installation in pilot-scale; (ii) to enlist all the probable sets of adsorbents (reactive materials) that can be used for different types of organic and inorganic contaminants; (iii) to understand the key mechanisms of degradation/removal of contaminants involved in PRB design; and (iv) to put forward the future research perspectives of this domain. Review augments that PRBs certainly has a low maintenance cost and a longer life span of ̃30 years that requires very ordinary skills. PRBs promise to be effective in developing countries like India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka for the removal of geogenic contaminants like arsenic and fluoride given the appropriate aquifer depth and hydrogeological settings like hydraulic gradient and transmissivity. Furthermore, reactive fillers required in PRBs are readily available, have longer expected life, and operate with no surrounding disturbances. With the advent of several green nanomaterials based adsorbents, PRB’s performance can achieve another height, but it needs the experiences from several pilot and larger scale projects. Indeed PRBs are the need of the hour, but a more programming-based investigation would be expected for its superior comprehension.

AB  - Through specific efforts to eliminate poverty over several decades, a large number of poverty-stricken families in China have been lifted out of poverty although, in some rural areas, there still exist a large number of very poor people. In 2013, to realize the aim of eliminating poverty in the whole of China by 2020, a specific, targeted poverty alleviation policy was proposed. A suitable evaluation mechanism is vital to measure the effect of this important policy. Because there are intrinsic uncertainties related to the reliability of information about poverty-stricken families, we use linguistic term sets (LTS) to express experts’ opinions. Thus, aggregated information from all relevant experts can be described as probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs). We propose a novel case-based reasoning method to rank and cluster poverty-stricken families considering both the decision data and experts’ experiences. We first propose a new preference value function for PLTS considering the experts’ bounded rationality. Additionally, we propose a DEMATEL (decision making trial and evaluation laboratory) method for PLTSs to analyze relations of criteria and find key factors in the evaluation system. To illustrate our process, we apply our method to a real case of a village from Inner Mongolia. Based on this case study, we rank and cluster 21 poverty-stricken families, and present an analysis of the key factors that influence the evaluation system.

AB  - This paper deals with the problem of allocating additional resources in a public university system. Instead of a solution imposed from above, the proposed bargaining approach lets the universities voluntarily agree on a solution that benefits them all. To be realistic the allocation assumes that the universities will keep their current technical efficiency. A bargaining problem is formulated, defining the corresponding feasible set and disagreement point. Four different bargaining solutions, namely Nash, Kalai-Smorodinsky, Egalitarian and Utilitarian, are considered and discussed. The proposed approach is applied to a real-world dataset involving the nine public universities of the Andalusian region. The results of the different bargaining solutions are very consistent as regards the output and utility improvements to be achieved by each university.

AB  - Resources and environment provide the fundamental conditions for human beings to live. Coordinating the relationship between resources and environmental protection and economic development is a necessary measure for humans to pursue sustainable development. To explore the Haihe River basin’s economic and resource carrying capacity development, 26 indexes from 2000 to 2016 were selected based on pressure state response model selection. Through the TOPSIS model, the entropy method, the exponential smoothing method, and the Hurst index, the comprehensive capacity of the Haihe River is constructed. This study aims to quantify each carrying capacity of the Haihe River basin and analyse their levels and characteristics, with an emphasis on the trade-off analysis between economic carrying capacity and resource and environmental carrying capacity; finally, the study aims to predict the development of each type of carrying capacity. The results showed that in the Haihe River basin, there’s dramatic change in comprehensive carrying capacity’s level and subsystems from 2000 to 2016. The resource and environmental carrying capacity have negative correlation with economic carrying capacity, while a positive correlation between talent carrying capacity and economic carrying capacity. Based on prediction, from 2017 to 2021, the level of development of each capacity subsystem indicated an increase in sustainability. This research provides a trade-off analysis between the economic and resource and environmental carrying capacity. The study also offers a theoretical basis to the coordinated development of various carrying capacities, which has reference significance for promoting the sustainable development of the river basin.

AB  - Transportation systems are highly dynamic, complex and interdisciplinary in nature, thus transiting it towards sustainability is difficult due to two reasons. One, covering every aspect of it simultaneously is a complicated issue and two, it becomes a barrier to communication among stakeholders with different areas of expertise. Indices (or composite indicators) for sustainable transportation (ST) are useful in overcoming these issues. Constructing indices for ST involves various steps in which the selection of suitable indicator set and framework forms the foundation. Moreover, the choice of most appropriate methods of normalization, weighting, and aggregation is also challenging. The main aim of this review paper is to bring forth various methodologies that have been adopted across different regions of the world (at different scales) for the development of ST indices. The effort has been made to explore the challenges (and solutions thereof) regarding the selection of suitable ST indicators and frameworks and also find the spatio-temporal suitability of methods of normalization, weighting, and aggregation. In this line, literature was first collected and then selected systematically. Then the selected literature was reviewed and analyzed. Various indicator and framework typologies followed by the challenges involved in their selection were discussed along with transportation specific examples. Next, a suite of 24 studies in which the primary focus was on the development of the ST index was further analyzed, highlighting the diversity in the choice of methods of normalization, weighting, and aggregation. Relative pros and cons of 7 normalization methods, 5 weighting methods, and 7 aggregation methods were tabulated to discuss their suitability. As a result of the systematic review and analysis of the literature, 18 specific criteria, broadly classified into representational, practical and contextual criteria were identified, which we argue will aid transportation professionals as far as the selection of “suitable indicator set” is concerned. To develop a framework for ST, seven essential attributes were identified. Moreover, it was found that answering an integrated set of questions: “why,” “what,” and “how” to choose and use the ST indicators are crucial in developing robust ST frameworks. The choice of methods of normalization, weighting, and aggregation with respect to time, scale and space was found critical as it would lead to varying results. It was also found that most of the studies lacked declaration and assessment of assumptions linked with these methods as doing so makes the choice of these methods vague and questionable.

AB  - Environmental sustainability problems frequently require the need for decision-making in situations containing considerable uncertainty. Monte Carlo simulation methods have been used in a wide array of environmental planning settings to incorporate these uncertain features. Simulation-generated outputs are commonly displayed as probability distributions. Recently simulation decomposition (SD) has enhanced the visualization of the cause-effect relationships of multi-variable combinations of inputs on the corresponding simulated outputs. SD partitions sub-distributions of the Monte Carlo outputs by pre-classifying selected input variables into states, grouping combinations of these states into scenarios, and then collecting simulated outputs attributable to each multi-variable input scenario. Since it is a straightforward task to visually project the contribution of the subdivided scenarios onto the overall output, SD can illuminate previously unidentified connections between the multi-variable combinations of inputs on the outputs. SD is generalizable to any Monte Carlo method with negligible additional computational overhead and, therefore, can be readily extended into most environmental analyses that use simulation models. This study demonstrates the efficacy of SD for environmental sustainability decision-making on a carbon footprint analysis case for wooden pallets.

AB  - Lightweight cellular materials can effectively improve the crashworthiness of thin-walled structure. To further investigate the potential of honeycomb-filled composite structures, an innovative self-similar graded honeycomb-filled thin-walled structure is proposed in this paper. First, the numerical model of the self-similar graded honeycomb-filled circular tube (SGHCT) is established in ABAQUS and then is validated via the existing experiment. To systematically study the bending behavior of this novel structure, eight kinds of SGHCT with different graded patterns are designed and compared with uniform honeycomb-filled circular tube (UHCT). Through parametric study, we find that the novel structure exhibits better energy absorption characteristics than the corresponding UHCT. In addition, various parameters like thickness, mass ratio and yield stress of column wall have a considerable effect on the crashworthiness performance of this innovative structure. Furthermore, the bending behaviors of effective SGHCT are also investigated to increase the weight efficiency. Finally, the SGHT and UHCT are optimized by adopting the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Kriging modeling technique. The optimization results show that the SGHCTs show superior Pareto solutions to the uniform honeycomb-filled tubes, also better crashworthiness than foam-filled tubes under high PCF conditions in the previous researches. Especially, the specific energy absorption of ascending single-direction self-similar tube increases from 1.17 kJ/kg to 1.74 kJ/kg by 48.9%. The findings of this study offer a new route of designing novel crashworthiness structure with high energy absorption capacity.

AB  - The use of multi-source energy systems is a promising technical solution for the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions and, at the meantime, for enhancing the exploitation of renewable energy sources. The present paper analyses a Solar Assisted Ground Source Heat Pump system and tries to fill the gap in the literature, where a direct comparison between the consolidated solar thermal technology and the emerging and widely discussed photovoltaic thermal technology is missing. Indeed, the two different devices for the exploitation of solar energy have been analysed through dynamic simulations carried out in TRNSYS environment. Through this approach, it is possible to investigate and predict in detail the thermal and electrical behaviour of the energy system, composed by a water-to-water heat pump, which withdraws from two thermal reservoirs that are connected to a solar loop, composed either of solar thermal collectors or of photovoltaic thermal panels and to a ground loop. The heat pump is used to provide space cooling and space heating to a residential building, through fan coil terminal units or radiant floor system. Furthermore, the heat pump system assists the solar field in the production of domestic hot water. This study looks at the development of a flexible system able to work in different operating conditions. The model’s boundary conditions can be changed for simulating a variety of case studies as the weather condition, the building load and the domestic hot water profile can be easily changed, together with specific components’ parameters. The control strategy makes it possible to vary the setpoint temperatures for simulating different operating conditions and management choices. In this way, the user can easily adapt the model functions to a specific plant system. The operating conditions of the two systems layouts have been compared and the energy performances evaluated for three case studies characterised by the weather conditions of the European cities of Berlin (mild-cold climate), Venice (mild climate) and Barcelona (mild-warm climate), and the corresponding thermal load profile of a two-storey building with a useful floor area of 170 m2. The study shows the possibility to directly exploit the solar energy for the domestic hot water production and as a heat source for the heat pump. The results from the comparison between the two systems’ configurations, with photovoltaic thermal panels and with solar thermal collectors, prove that there is the possibility to obtain a relevant improvement in the efficiency of the heat pump using photovoltaic thermal panels. The investigated multi-source energy system, moreover, allows an optimal employment of the available renewable heat sources and could easily be applied to case studies characterized by different boundary conditions.

AB  - Currently, the global gives a unique awareness of sustainable development by exploiting renewables to provide the people with affordable and clean energy and preserve the climate. This paper proposes a methodical and explicit framework of four phases, to design an autonomous hybrid renewable energy system in a community area in Egypt: preliminarily assessment, design optimization analysis, findings evaluation, and power-quality assessment. In the first three phases which performed by HOMER Pro® software, five hybridization scenarios are evaluated and compared regarding their life-cycle cost, carbon outflows, and reliability to distinguish the extraordinary scenario to supply the addressed community area. Contrary to the majority of studies that suffice only the first three phases, the fourth phase is proposed to perform a power-quality valuation based on a power management strategy (PMS). The results reveal that the optimal configuration consists of a photovoltaic generator, wind-driven generator, diesel-genset, battery-bank, and a power converter with the minimum net present cost of 351,223 $ and energy cost of 0.2262 $/kWh among all configurations. The optimal system has a negligible capacity shortage of 0.0955% and produces the least amount of emitted gases by 50.43 tones/year due to the high renewable fraction (57%). Moreover, the optimal proposed system can recover the invested money after only 3.4 years. The proposed PMS profitably harmonized the system’s energy exchange, kept sufficient reserve energy at all times, and maintained the system stability under various meteorological and load disturbances. This can be verified from the superior stabilization of the dc-bus, load voltage and frequency during the examined disturbances.

This paper proposes a day-ahead optimal voltage control scheme for transmission system considering static var compensators (SVCs), capacitor banks, load tap changers(LTCs) transformers and synchronous machines. The scheme is based on defining an optimization problem which includes two objective functions for reactive power reserve and voltage regulation precision of SVCs, two objective functions related to number of capacitors switching and LTCs tap changing, and two objective functions for improving the network performance. The multi-objective optimization problem is solved subject to a complete set of constraints related to the network and voltage control devices. The solution algorithm of the proposed problem is based on defining a single objective function by applying appropriate weighting coefficients to the normalized indices. Performance of the proposed scheme is investigated on IEEE 30-bus system through various studies. Particularly, the effectiveness of the scheme is demonstrated to realize the objectives for conditions where the load profiles at transmission buses are considerably modified due to structuring changes in the downstream networks.

AB  - Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) are becoming an attractive area of application for small hydropower, which can contribute to the development of distributed energy generation from renewable sources. Indeed, WDNs experience considerable water leakages due to their age and water management authorities often divide the WDNs by inserting Pressure Reducing Valves (PRVs), which waste a potentially recoverable hydraulic head. The replacement of PRVs with Pump as Turbines (PaTs) can be considered as an economically feasible solution to achieve both an effective pressure control and a throttling energy recovery. The selection, installation and control strategy of a PaT in a WDN must consider the variability of the pressure and the flow rate demand. Starting from the evaluation of the available head and the water demand, in this work, we describe a methodology to select from pump catalogues the most suitable PaT and the best control criteria for a specific WDN. Then, knowing the pump geometry, it is possible to predict the characteristic curve of the pump operating as a turbine by using a 1-D performance prediction model. The WDN of a town in the Apulia region (Southern Italy) has been used as a case study. Finally, a techno-economic evaluation has been carried out by considering both economic and environmental benefits.

AB  - The cyber security of NPPs recently has become a major issue, and a utility in Korea is requested to follow cyber security controls and to perform cyber security risk management based on the regulatory guide RS-015. Since it is difficult to fully implement the controls with limited resources, it is necessary to find which controls are relatively more important than other controls. The aim of this study is to develop a method for quantifying the relative importance of NPP cyber attack probability variables. These variables were investigated, and rearrangement and classification of them was validated by the factor analysis method. The relative importance among the variables was quantified by the AHP method. By applying the relative importance to the regulatory guide, the controls that have higher priority to be implemented were identified. Considering the relatively more important controls, it is expected that the utility can follow cyber security controls efficiently.

AB  - In the decision-making process, various approximate weighting methods such as equal weights, rank-order centroid weights, rank-sum weights, and rank reciprocal weights, have been proposed to deal with multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems in situations where only rank order information can be captured. In this paper, we seek to contribute fresh insights through the development of an integrated programming approach which unifies different weighting methods. From this integrated approach, a new weight method, rank order total weights (ROT) is introduced, and the assessment methods with associated programming equations, propositions and characteristics are carefully investigated. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by using an illustration of real problem with U.S. business school ranking.

AB  - Climate change and urbanization are converging to challenge the flood control in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) due to their adverse impacts on precipitation extremes and the urban areas environment. Previous studies have investigated temporal changes in flood risk with various single factor, few have considered the joint effects of climate change, urbanization and socio-economic development. Here, based on the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of future (2030-2050) flood risk over the PRD combined with a thorough investigation of climate change, urbanization and socio-economic development. Precipitation extremes were projected using the regional climate model RegCM4.6, and urbanization growth was projected based on the CA-Markov model. The economic and population development was estimated by the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). Flood risk mapping with different RCPs-urbanization-SSPs scenarios was developed for the PRD based on the set pair analyze theory. The results show that climate change and urbanization are expected to exacerbate flood risk in most parts of the PRD during the next few decades, concurrently with more intense extreme precipitation events. The high flood risk areas are projected mainly in the urban regions with unfavorable terrain and dense population. The highest flood risk areas are expected to increase by 8.72% and 19.80% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions may effectively mitigate the flood risk over the PRD. This study highlight the links between flood risk and changing environment, suggesting that flood risk management and preventative actions should be included in regional adaptation strategies.

AB  - Portfolio optimization with cardinality constraints turns out to be a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem which is proven to be NP-Complete that limits the efficiency of exact solution approaches, often because of the long-running times. Therefore, particular attention has been given to approximate approaches such as metaheuristics which do not guarantee optimality, yet may expeditiously provide near-optimal solutions. The purpose of this study is to present an efficient hybrid metaheuristic algorithm that combines critical components from continuous ant colony optimization, artificial bee colony optimization and genetic algorithms for solving cardinality constrained portfolio optimization problem. Computational results on seven publicly available benchmark problems confirm the effectiveness of the hybrid integration mechanism. Moreover, comparisons against other methods’ results in the literature reveal that the proposed solution approach is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB  - The basis of smart city services is urban sensing, i.e., the collection of data from sensors deployed in urban settings. However, it has been recently when mobile objects have started to be monitored to feed smart applications within the smart city ecosystems. Most of the advances in this area focus on gathering data from public transportation services such as buses or trams, which use to employ regular cellular or WiFi-based networks and state-of-the-art TCP/IP protocols. Although this covers a basic on-board equipment to report position and other sensor data, there is not a direct integration of Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities in urban transportation and, in general, in moving “things”. Communication technologies used in regular wireless sensor networks such as ZigBee or Bluetooth are not appropriate for high mobility patterns. The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) paradigm aims at filling these gaps, exploiting the synergy between IoT and vehicular networks. It is an emerging area in which extra efforts should be paid to cover constrained capabilities of end devices installed on personal mobility devices, e.g., scooters, segways or bicycles. The solution proposed here deals with the connectivity of moving objects by developing an on-board unit for energy-constrained vehicles, integrating communication capabilities using the Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies Long Range Wide-area Network (LoRaWAN) and Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT) to efficiently collect data. A set of sensors are included to target services in the areas of urban mobility, enhanced environmental perception and speed-up of city operations. The on-board unit has been evaluated through real-life experiments to study especially its communication capabilities with NB-IoT, obtaining good performances in terms of packet delivery ratio and network delay under non-ideal coverage settings. Results show that NB-IoT presents better performances than LoRaWAN, as compared to our previous experiences, with negligible packet loss rates and two-way delays under 100 ms with Internet nodes, at the expense of needing a proper operator network deployment and consuming extra energy due to NB-IoT protocol complexity.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a data-driven approach to the irregular flight recovery problem. By imitating the decision process of dispatchers, we develop a quantitative mechanism to evaluate the disrupted flight and to provide easily adopted recovery suggestions. Our method consists of two steps. The first step is to establish a scoring system based on interviews, questionnaires, and operational data. Specifically, an irregular flight will be assigned a real-time score representing the importance of the flight and the impact of its current status. This score is also used to evaluate the necessity of the immediate recovery of the irregular flight. The second step is to generate feasible adjustment plan, which decrease the total scores of the related flights. Having validated by 306 manually recorded recovery actions, the scoring system successfully explains most of the recovery actions from dispatchers, meaning that the scoring system is consistent with the airline recovery strategy. To further demonstrate the recovery method's feasibility and response time, we also conducted tests based on one-day flight schedule simulation containing 92 flights and 7 historical cases from one Chinese airline. These tests prove the feasible adjustment plans can be generated in real-time, help airlines mitigate disruption effects to the network and reduce their decision process by 5–10 min in each delay scenario.

AB  - In modern manufacturing environments, the quality assurance of machined parts has attracted great attention from manufacturers. Surface finish and vibrations during turning play an important role during this process. Comparatively less work is done in the field of process parameter optimization. EN19 is a hard steel which finds its application in shafts, gears, spindles, oil and gas industries. Due to the hardness of the material, 223-277 BHN, turning this material is a difficult task. Thus, optimization of various cutting parameters is required in this situation. In the current work, an attempt has been made to optimize machining parameters when turning EN19 with coated carbide inserts (Titanium Nitride coated CCMT060204-HM YBC251 inserts) on conventional lathe machine. During this process, three factors, namely, MQL Condition (2 levels), Depth of cut (3 levels) and Spindle Speed (3 levels) are considered. Mixed level optimization is performed using Taguchi analysis with L18 orthogonal array. The considered factors/parameters are optimized for Surface Roughness and Vibrations with the objective functions being to minimize the same

AB  - The present work aims to determine a suitable yield-productivity balance in bioethanol production from hydrothermally pretreated sugarcane straw via pre-saccharification (PS) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). PS experiments were carried out evaluating effects of enzymatic dosage, biomass loading, and PS time. The performance of the whole process (PSSSF) was evaluated based on overall ethanol yield and productivity considering a simultaneous optimization (desirability function) of both variables. The multi-criteria optimization enabled to reach 5.7% w/w ethanol concentration yielding 290 L of ethanol per ton of pretreated sugarcane straw within 45 h of total processing time. Furthermore, a techno-economic analysis was performed under optimized conditions (14.5 FPU/gcellulose, 19.3% w/v biomass loading and 33 h PS time). This process was integrated into a first-generation plant. Although the economic evaluation exhibited a negative performance, a sensitivity analysis indicated that a decrease of 23.3% in operational expenditure would be enough to achieve feasibility.

AB  - Location selection for citrus orchards is an important topic in terms of sustainable agriculture policies, agricultural planning, and community. This study presents a model to evaluate land suitability for cultivation of citrus in Antalya Province of Turkey. The aim of this study is to provide a Geographical Information System-Multi Criteria Evaluation based spatial decision support system, taking into account the viewpoints of local citrus growers and experts. 13 exclusion criteria, 3 main evaluation criteria (13 sub-criteria), and 52 value ranges were determined for citrus land suitability analysis. Analytic Hierarchy Process was utilised to calculate the weights of evaluation criteria. Inverse Distance Weighting interpolation approach was used to estimate the values of meteorological parameters. Thematic maps were presented for each of the criteria and final suitability map was prepared using Weighted Overlay method in Geographic Information System environment. The final suitability thematic map showed that the suitable zones (1281.19 km2) for citrus cultivation were located in the coastal regions of Antalya province. The average temperature in the winter season was determined to be the most important sub-criteria for citrus cultivation, followed by elevation, the average temperature in the flowering period, land use capability, daily average sunshine time, annual average precipitation, proximity to irrigation ponds and dam lakes and others. Most of the cultivated citrus orchards often coincided with the appropriate sites presented as a result of the study, and most of these sites were generally classified as high and moderate suitable zones. This study will be an important and useful regional guideline in terms of agricultural land use planning, citrus orchards management and community.

AB  - We propose an optimal intraday trading algorithm to reduce overall transaction costs by absorbing price shocks when an online portfolio selection (OPS) method rebalances its portfolio. Having considered the real-time data of limit order books (LOBs), the trading algorithm optimally splits a sizeable market order into a number of consecutive market orders to minimise the overall transaction costs, including both the liquidity costs and the proportional transaction costs. The proposed trading algorithm, compatible with any OPS methods, optimises the number of intraday trades and finds an optimal intraday trading path. Backtesting results from the historical LOB data of NASDAQ-traded stocks show that the proposed trading algorithm significantly reduces the overall transaction costs when market liquidity is limited.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel weighted-additive fuzzy multi-choice goal programming (WA-FMCGP) model for the imprecise decision context wherein several conflicting goals are present but each goal has multiple-choice aspiration levels (MCALs) and, around them, the fuzzinesses are expressed in terms of membership functions (MFs). The main contribution of this model is its use of an objective function that minimises the weighted-additive summation of the normalised deviations; thus, the model can adopt any minimisation process from any goal programming (GP) variant. The advantages of this FGP-MCGP (fuzzy GP – multi-choice GP) model are shown by using it to solve a numerical example from F-MODM (fuzzy MODM) literature and comparing the results with those of a recent FP-MCGP (fuzzy programming – multi-choice GP) study. The application of the model is also verified using real data (i.e., it can model and support renewable energy site selection (RESS) where the decision context is imprecise). As WA-FMCGP is largely a MODM model, through its application, this study also provides a supplementary method in contrast to the multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) model applications used thus far for RESS.

AB  - Quantitative risk assessment (QRA) is a powerful and popular technique to support risk-based decisions. Unfortunately, QRAs are often hampered by significant uncertainty in the frequency of failure estimation for physical assets. This uncertainty is largely due to lack of quality failure data in published sources. The failure data may be limited, incompatible and/or outdated. Consequently, there is a need for robust methods and tools that can incorporate all available information to facilitate reliability analysis of critical assets such as pipelines, pressure vessels, rotating equipment, etc. This paper presents a novel practical approach that can be used to help overcome data scarcity issues in reliability analysis. A Bayesian framework is implemented to cohesively integrate objective data with expert opinion with the aim toward deriving time to failure distributions for physical assets. The Analytic Hierarchy Process is utilized to aggregate time to failure estimates from multiple experts to minimize biases and address inconsistencies in their estimates. These estimates are summarized in the form of informative priors that are implemented in a Bayesian update procedure for the Weibull distribution. The flexibility of the proposed methodology allows for efficiently dealing with data limitations. Application of the proposed approach is illustrated using a case study.

AB  - Seabed substrates have the capacity to support a variety of marine communities. However, habitats provided by natural substrates are increasingly modified and supplemented by man-made structures. These provide hard surfaces suitable for colonisation by sedentary and/or non-migratory organisms, and may contribute to an interconnected system of benefit to diverse marine populations. Robust assessment of the influence of such structures is, therefore, a necessary consideration for their long-term management. The challenge of compiling and manipulating data for input to two North Sea models is described. Source data were processed and gridded at three different spatial resolutions to investigate the effect of scale on spatial relationships. Choice of grid size was found to exacerbate existing uncertainty in location and extent of features, influencing interpretation of their spatial distributions at the different scales examined. The small spatial footprint of man-made structures, compared with natural substrates, may lead to underestimation of the influence of the former at coarser model scales. Choices must be made between data availability, spatial resolution and accuracy, modelling and analysis requirements, to identify robust approaches to reliable outcomes. Model sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are recommended for application in data-limited situations. Greater openness and cooperation in data-sharing is required for robust scientific modelling to underpin decision-making in the marine environment.

AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) panels, being an eco-friendly technology, have become a crucial source of electricity, satisfying the increasing energy demand and substituting the related shortage occurring in the conventional energy sources. Despite absorbing about 80% of incident radiation, PV cells have low conversion efficiency; hence, a minor portion of the absorbed radiation is gained as electrical power, and the majority is converted into heat increasing the panel temperature. Undesirably, the higher panel temperature, the lower conversion performance, and lesser reliability over the long term occur. Hence, many cooling systems have been designed and investigated, aiming to effectively avoid the excessive temperature rise. This paper aims to review and merge the recent cooling methods investigations on PV, categorizing them according to heat transfer modes: convective cooling (hydro and aero-based cooling with or without extended surfaces), conductive cooling (phase change materials), and radiative cooling. Each category and corresponding works are discussed in detail, and main resulted enhancements, with respect to uncooled PV panels, are presented. In addition, applications of hybrid photovoltaic-thermal systems are clarified with indicating main improvements in their electrical, thermal, and overall efficiencies. It expected that the presented work can provide a new comprehensive taxonomy for cooling techniques applied to photovoltaics.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are an emerging technology with the potential to be used in industries and various sectors of human life to provide a wide range of applications and services. During the last decade, there has been a growing focus of research in the UAV's assistance paradigm as a fundamental concept resulting in the constant improvement between different kinds of ground networks and the hovering UAVs in the sky. Recently, the wide availability of embedded wireless interfaces in the communicating entities has allowed the deployment of such a paradigm simpler and easiest. Moreover, due to UAVs' controlled mobility and adjustable altitudes, they can be considered as the most appropriate candidate to enhance the performance and overcome the restrictions of ground networks. This comprehensive survey both studies and summarizes the existing UAV-assisted research, such as routing, data gathering, cellular communications, Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and disaster management that supports existing enabling technologies. Descriptions, classifications, and comparative studies related to different UAV-assisted proposals are presented throughout the paper. By pointing out numerous future challenges, it is expected to simulate research in this emerging and hot research area. To the best of our knowledge, there are many survey papers on the topic from a technology perspective. Nevertheless, this survey can be considered as the first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of different types of existing UAV-assisted networks and describes the state-of-the-art in UAV-assisted research.

KW  - Triangular multiplicative preference relation
AB  - Triangular multiplicative preference relation (TMPR) is an efficient technology which can make experts to comfortably express their paired comparisons. Existing consistency definitions of TMPR overlook experts' trust levels on their judgments. Considering experts' trust levels, this paper proposes a left and right (L-R) geometric consistency definition of TMPR and develops a new group decision-making (GDM) method. The L-R geometric means of triangular fuzzy number (TFN) are defined. Then, L-R geometric consistency of TMPR is given involving experts' trust levels about their judgments. To improve the consistency, a programming model is constructed to derive an acceptably consistent TMPR from an unacceptably consistent one. Using the difference degree between two TMPRs, a new approach is presented to extract experts' weights. Two algorithms are established for the methods of individual decision-making (IDM) with a TMPR and GDM with TMPRs. A simulation algorithm is devised to verify the superiority of the proposed IDM with a TMPR. Simulation results reveal that the proposed IDM method outperforms existing methods in logarithmic Hamming distance and difference degree. L-R geometric consistency makes contribution to TMPR since it considers experts' trust levels and has reciprocity, invariance and robustness. Several real-life examples are furnished to explain the validity of two proposed algorithms.

AB  - The aim of this study is to analyse the productivity of airports, operated by the General Directorate of State Airports Authority (DHMI in Turkish acronym) in Turkey, for a period from 2014 to 2018 using a hybrid method called Weight Restricted EATWOS without Consideration of Satisficing Levels and to offer improvement suggestions. The productivity of the airports was also measured using both equally weighted EATWOS without consideration of satisficing levels and the model of input-oriented DEA based on the assumption of constant returns to scale to compare the results obtained using the proposed model with those obtained using traditional methods.

AB  - A new platform was developed for determination of drugs in plasma without extraction or instrumental analysis just using TLC, smart phone digital camera and free image processing software. Lamotrigine, antiepileptic drug was used as model analyte. The proposed platform depends on using oil-in-water (O/W) microemulsion to isolate the drug from plasma proteins and using water-in-oil (W/O) microemulsion as mobile phase for TLC which results in complete separation between lamotrigine and plasma as viewed under UV lamp. The composition of both microemulsions was optimized using Taguchi orthogonal array and Plackett- Burman design. The optimal (O/W) microemulsion predicted composition was 0.01 mL Butyl acetate, 4 mL butanol, 0.925 gm SDS and 8.6 mL water while the (W/O) mobile phase microemulsion was 9 mL Butyl acetate, 1 mL butanol, 0.25 gm SDS, 0.25 mL water. Separation was carried out on a silica gel 60F-254 plate eluted with the (W/O) microemulsion in about 30 min development time. The images of TLC plates were processed using 4 different programs, by comparing their results it was found that “integrated density” measured by Fiji software was the most accurate response that could measure the concentration of lamotrigine in spiked plasma in the range of (20–200) ng/spot. This method was applied also for determination of lamotrigine in lamictal® tablet dosage form using the same mobile phase. The precision of the method was satisfactory; the maximum value of relative standard deviations did not exceed 1.5%. While the accuracy was proved by the low values of % error and high values of recovery.

KW  - Desktop 3D printers
KW  - Additive manufacturing
KW  - Ranking models
AB  - While additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing, has been in existence commercially for ∼30 years, desktop 3D printers are a relatively new and rapidly growing market segment. Both well-established AM companies and an increasing number of new enterprises are designing and retailing desktop systems of various sizes, capabilities, and prices. With the abundance of desktop systems now on the market, a consumer may benefit from determining which system best serves their needs. This research highlights differences amongst 45 desktop 3D printers and suggests a method by which to evaluate such differences. For this, a standard part consisting of various geometric features was designed and printed using each system. An updated version of a previously developed quantitative ranking model was utilized to rate the build precision of each system as well as other features, including build volume, size, cost, weight, and layer resolution. In addition, the research team observed part aesthetics and quantified mechanical properties. The criteria evaluated in this ranking model may be modified by each user, to extend this methodology to other desktop AM systems, including professional-grade machines. The results from the model presented in this research were compared with other commonly used ranking methods to help evaluate each technique. These included a simple ascending order rank based model adjusted for ties (1-best and 45-worst), a percentile value based model evaluating the factor contribution values presented in this paper; and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) which evaluated separation measures from ideal and worst solutions. As expected, the comparisons demonstrated that each model had slightly different rankings as compared to the model presented in this paper, with some outliers. Consequently, it was observed that percentile value based models (such as one presented in this paper) provide rankings different from separation value based models (from ideal and worst solutions) such as TOPSIS.

AB  - Context:
Software architecture is a knowledge-intensive field. One mechanism for storing architecture knowledge is the recognition and description of architectural patterns. Selecting architectural patterns is a challenging task for software architects, as knowledge about these patterns is scattered among a wide range of literature.
Method:
We report on a systematic literature review, intending to build a decision model for the architectural pattern selection problem. Moreover, twelve experienced practitioners at software-producing organizations evaluated the usability and usefulness of the extracted knowledge.
Results:
An overview is provided of 29 patterns and their effects on 40 quality attributes. Furthermore, we report in which systems the 29 patterns are applied and in which combinations. The practitioners confirmed that architectural knowledge supports software architects with their decision-making process to select a set of patterns for a new problem. We investigate the potential trends among architects to select patterns.
Conclusion:
With the knowledge available, architects can more rapidly select and eliminate combinations of patterns to design solutions. Having this knowledge readily available supports software architects in making more efficient and effective design decisions that meet their quality concerns.

AB  - Although economic and environmental considerations have been well integrated into water resources management, the social aspects have been usually neglected. Quantifying and embedding social attachments in the water resource management models are so challenging. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to quantify and consider social attachments for water and wastewater allocation in urban areas. In the management of shared resources, one of the main issues is the level of cooperation among agents. In a multi-agent environment, stakeholders can decide non-aligned or depending on their interests and social attachment, have some cooperation and coordination in the decision making process. In the proposed approach, an effort has been made to take into account the effects of social attachments on agents' decisions. In this paper, social network analysis is applied to evaluate the coordination level between agents in the use of shared water resources. A paired physical and behavioral simulation model is developed to assess water and wastewater allocation scenarios. A reinforcement learning approach, namely Q-learning is used to develop the behavioral model, which is linked with social attachments. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed approach, the Kan River Basin in the western part of the Tehran metropolitan area is studied. By using the proposed approach for a 25-year simulation horizon and 63 water and treated wastewater allocation scenarios, it is shown that it has merits to find the best scenarios in different conditions and can enhance the sustainability of the water resources in the study area. According to the results, improving the social attachments in the study area can reduce the over exploitation of groundwater and improve the groundwater quality.

AB  - Nowadays, advanced machining techniques are widely used for solving various issues in manufacturing operations that include machining high strength materials, production of complex shaped profiles, better surface features, capable of high levels of precision, miniaturization, reduction of waste and secondary operations and lower production time. Among the various advanced machining techniques, abrasive water jet (AWJ) machining has received more attention from researchers and practicing engineers in manufacturing industries due to its capability of extensive operations and excellent quality of the cutting edge obtained during this process much superior to others, is reported by previous researchers. AWJ process is classified into abrasive water injection jet and abrasive slurry jet on the basis of the different ways of mixing between abrasive and water. This study explores the researches made on Injection type AWJ machining process as it is widely accepted by researchers and Industries for solving various issues. Review articles on AWJ have been collected from the year of 1960–2019. Hence, this study provides a detailed report on AWJ machining process (majority of discussion on metals and their compounds) through demonstration of various studies on subjects that include performance and surface characteristics, hybrid processes, versatile operations, micro machining and medical applications. A literature survey of recent trends and their applications of AWJ process has also been documented. Optimization studies have been discussed with various techniques used in the AWJ machining process. This has been referred to in this paper. In addition, future opportunties in AWJ have been discussed including a demand for requirements in various fields. The entire collection of results are of help in finding the niche applications for manufacturing operations in future. The outcome of this paper would also support present and future researchers in the identification of the significant process parameters, work materials and advanced techniques for getting better results in AWJ machining process.

AB  - In three-way decision, how to reflect the risk attitude in determining decision rules is an important issue. In the classical three-way decision model, loss functions are used to measure risks and determine the minimum-cost decision rules. On this basis, the utility function has been used as a new risk measurement to determine the maximum-utility decision rules. However, some studies show that utility theory may produce some paradoxes and cannot reflect the real risk attitude. To address this problem, we propose a prospect theory-based three-way decision model. In this scenario, we use prospect theory to describe decision-makers’ risk attitudes and utilize the value function as a new risk measurement. The decision rules are induced based on the principle of prospect value maximization. Then, we analyze and prove the existence and uniqueness of thresholds. Two specific analytic solutions of thresholds are calculated and the simplified decision rules are derived. A case study is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our model and make comparisons with other related models. Finally, the results of the experimental analysis are reported to validate the feasibility and performance of our proposed model.

AB  - The water cycle is important in maintaining sustainable development in the Anthropocene. Objective evaluation of the water cycle health status is conducive to the development of scientific and rational water management measures. The particularity of evaluation of the water cycle means the random error of the evaluation index and the threshold fuzziness of the evaluation degree are issues that require attention. This study considered 13 cities in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region to establish a method based on a cloud model for the assessment of water cycle health. The water cycle health status was evaluated in terms of four dimensions: water ecology, water quality, water quantity, and water use. Moreover, the evaluation result was compared with results derived using a composite index method. The amount of change in the evaluation results under 11 random error conditions and the maximum fuzzy conditions of each threshold grade were simulated. It was found that the established cloud model produced results consistent with the composite index method, while it had the advantage of being able to evaluate the proportion of each grade in detail by reflecting the randomness and fuzziness of the evaluation. According to statistical data from 2000 to 2014, the average distribution of water cycle health grade in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region was 28%–16%–34%–13%–9% (sick–unhealthy–subhealthy–healthy–excellent), i.e., the region was generally in a subhealthy state, in which the water quantity dimension was the worst and the water use dimension was the best. The degree of influence of the random error of the index on the evaluation results of each layer increased with the increase of the random error, and the threshold boundary fuzziness of the indicator grade led to a trend of homogenization of each grade component. The control of the random errors of the indicators under different sensitivity ranges could effectively improve the rationality and stability of the evaluation results. The research results presented in this paper could provide technical support for water cycle evaluation, measurement of indicator data, and statistical error control.

Objective
To identify what factors drive choices among interventions for hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA), and to rank the characteristics of interventions.
Methods
In this phased, mixed-methods design involving cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary stakeholders – healthcare consumers, providers, policy-makers, Māori health advocates and OA experts – we used the Nominal Group Technique in focus groups to generate data. We conducted thematic analysis of the focus group data to inform a framework of categories and sub-categories describing factors and characteristics influencing the choice of OA interventions. We then used a dual-panel, two-round e− Delphi survey to verify the framework and rank the characteristics of interventions.
Results
From six focus groups (n = 38 participants), 364 factors were identified and clustered into 56 themes (mean 9 themes per focus group; range 5–15). Thematic analysis revealed a framework of 3 core categories: characteristics of interventions (10 sub-categories), characteristics of consumers (10 sub-categories) and characteristics of the health system (7 sub-categories). In Delphi round 1, the framework was verified by each of two panels (n = 65, ≥80% acceptability). In round 2, two characteristics of interventions were combined, resulting in 9 characteristics (in decreasing order of importance): effectiveness, appropriateness, quality of the evidence, accessibility, harm, cost, duration, passivity, and immediacy of intervention effect.
Conclusion
Stakeholders make choices among interventions for hip or knee OA within a framework of characteristics of interventions, of consumers, and of the health system. We identified and ranked 9 key characteristics of interventions that stakeholders consider when choosing or recommending interventions for hip or knee OA.

AB  - In the last decades, the debate on renewable energy has received international attention. In the European countries, several wind energy projects encounter objections and protests from the neighbouring population of wind farm sites. This study aims to understand the drivers of this obstructive behaviour suggesting the main issues to discuss for adequate regulatory strategies to promote at community level. The novelty of this study is that for the first time, qualitative – Focus Group – and quantitative – Optimized-Analytic Hierarchy Process and Monte Carlo simulation – approaches, are used synergistically to support the view of a social acceptance to wind energy. In particular, the analysis focuses on: i) People’s perception of wind energy in a context of public engagement; ii) Assessment of the factors affecting a wind farm; iii) Differences occurring in people’s perception living nearby or far from wind farms. Main results suggest a general critical attitude due to misinformation and lack of transparency of governmental institutions. Moreover, the density of turbines, dismantling process and impacts on landscape and ecosystems need particular attention. Finally, our results show that the distance to wind farms would not sensibly affect the social acceptance across groups of stakeholders.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is a sophisticated communication paradigm that is capable of integrating diverse elements from humans to interactive machines. This kind of integration provides seamless and ubiquitous communication support for mobile users. The infrastructure of IoT environment endorses multiple technologies and networks where, selecting a precise neighbor/ device becomes mandatory for the extreme surveillance application. It determines the reliability is service discovery and resource access. The process of request processing through reliable neighbor discovery is leveraged using multi-criterion hysteresis optimization (MCHO) based on SDN aided routing that is discussed in this article. The introduced routing optimization method is capable of identifying reliable IoT neighbors for request handling and delivery. This routing process depends on the activation function that classifies neighbors on the basis of three metrics namely Received Signal Strength (RSS), Rank, and Expected Transmission Count (ETX)for differentiating the neighbors on the basis of their consistency. Through differentiated hysteresis analysis, the neighbors are segregated and hence optimal devices are integrated to form a request friendly route to the access layer. The introduced routing optimization method is evaluated through appropriate experiments and the results are verified using the metrics: throughput, request delivery ratio, delay, response time, request loss and average ETX.

However, there is a lack of understanding of challenges associated with successful execution of COSD projects. The objective of this study is to identify and prioritize the challenges that influence COSD projects. First, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and identified 21 challenges that impact COSD projects. Next, a questionnaire survey was developed based on the SLR findings to collect feedback from industry practitioners. Finally, we applied the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to rank the identified challenges for COSD projects. We also present a prioritization-based taxonomy of the identified challenges which will help practitioners to focus on the critical areas for successful implementation of COSD projects.

AB  - This study identifies three new bike station locations for Baltimore City's bikeshare program using a location allocation spatial analysis tool. Over 1.6 million Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates of bikeshare trips over a period of four months were used to identify the routes most frequently used by bikers. It was hypothesized that potential new bike station locations have a relationship with proximity to transit, attractions and restaurants/pubs. A negative correlation was found between route usage intensity and proximity to attractions and restaurants/pubs, which means that the closer the proximity to attractions or restaurants/pubs, the higher the road usage intensity is. A new methodology was developed by modifying Huff's gravity model, replacing facility location size with a suitability score. The bike station suitability score is calculated with regard to proximity to transit, attractions, restaurants/pubs and existing bike stations. A location allocation model is developed to maximize market share, i.e., the potential bike station locations will be accessible to maximum population while also being within a 400-m (0.25-mile) radius of attractions, restaurants/pubs and at least 300 m from existing bike stations. The location of the proposed bike stations through location allocation is within a block of the planned bike stations by the City of Baltimore, which corroborates the findings of this study. This methodology will be useful to identify new facility locations in any metropolitan city where maximum exposure is a necessity.

Though the spread of carsharing may bring significative benefits to (smart) cities, its penetration can be obstructed by non-up-to-date regulations, which can be still tied to a non-smart vision of mobility. In this study, we provide an overview of remarkable city regulations for carsharing, particularly highlighting the importance that parking policies can have in favouring the diffusion and use of carsharing services. Given such importance, we characterize the optimization problem of a local government that wants to analytically choose the best subset of parking slots to rent to carsharing companies, in order to improve urban mobility. To model and solve the problem we propose a new Binary Linear Programming problem and genetic-based matheuristic. Finally, we present results from computational tests referring to realistic data of the Italian city of Rome, showing that our optimization approach can return a fair territorial distribution of the parking slots, satisfying various families of constraints limiting the distribution.

AB  - Nowadays municipal solid waste (MSW) has become a vital part of the economy, both as an output of human activities and as an input in the economy through material or energy recovery. Education has been shown to be closely related to the amount of MSW generated. The present research uses panel data obtained for 25 world counties for the years 1995–2016 and the examined variables include MSW, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and education level. Through econometric methods, the present paper accounts for the presence of cross section dependence and uses appropriate panel unit root tests to discover feasible cointegrated relationships. Also it strongly accounts for the interdependence between MSW, economic growth and education level. Based on these, the validity of the Waste Kuznets Curve (WKC) hypothesis is redefined. Specifically, an inverted U-shape relationship is observed both in the static and dynamic analyses for MSW. The calculated turning points although quite high they are in all cases within the sample. In all specifications the sign of education level is negative as expected. Therefore it is shown that education can act as an effective tool to enhance pro-environmental behaviour leading in turn to lower MSW arisings.

AB  - The development of the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) has been motivated by the perceived limitations of fundamentally deterministic and probabilistic approaches to understand complex systems’ behaviour. Congruent with the principles of Resilience Engineering, over recent years the FRAM has been progressively developed in scientific terms, and increasingly adopted in industrial environments with reportedly successful results. Nevertheless, a wide literature review focused on the method is currently lacking. On these premises, this paper aims to summarise all available published research in English about FRAM. More than 1700 documents from multiple scientific repositories were reviewed through a protocol based on the PRISMA review technique. The paper aims to uncover a number of characteristics of the FRAM research, both in terms of the method’s application and of the authors contributing to its development. The systematic analysis explores the method in terms of its methodological aspects, application domains, and enhancements in qualitative and quantitative terms, as well as proposing potential future research directions.

In this paper, a working approach for cloud-based distributed optimisation for process planning and scheduling is presented. Three managers dynamically governing the creation and deletion of subpopulations (islands) evolved by a multi-objective genetic algorithm are proposed, compared and contrasted. A number of test cases based on two real-world manufacturing scenarios are used to show the applicability of the proposed solution.

AB  - Objectives
Our goal was to estimate the relative importance assigned to health technology assessment (HTA) criteria by stakeholders involved in the HTA process. HTA is an increasingly common framework used in the appraisal of drugs for public reimbursement. It identifies clinical, economic, social, and organizational criteria to be considered. The criteria can vary across jurisdictions and are typically appraised by multidisciplinary expert committees. Guidance on the relative weighing of criteria is often absent.
Methods
We elicited stakeholders’ preferences using a single-scenario discrete choice experiment and a best-worst scaling model with conviction scores to assess the weights assigned to selected criteria by HTA stakeholders. We recruited 111 HTA stakeholders across multiple jurisdictions, including members of expert committees, clinical and economic experts, patients, and public payer representatives. Each judged twelve hypothetical cancer drug profiles for suitability for public funding and identified which characteristics were best and worst. In addition to standard discrete choice experiment and best-worst scaling models, we estimated a hybrid model to obtain a ranking of criteria by importance they played in the appraisal.
Results
A strong clinical benefit proved the most important criterion, followed by cost considerations, presence of adverse events, and availability of other treatments. The importance of clinical benefit was moderated by unmet need, adverse events, and number of patients.
Conclusion
Policymakers might want to consider providing an explicit weighing scheme, or moving to a 2-stage selection process with an assessment of the quality of clinical evidence as a gatekeeping step for a full HTA review.

AB  - Determining the optimal capacity is an urgent problem in the planning and construction stages of hybrid systems. This study focused on exploring a universal method for determining the capacity configuration for the grid-connected integrated system incorporating cascade hydropower, solar/photovoltaic (PV), and wind considering cascade reservoir connection and PV-wind complementarity. First, the wind and solar energy complementarity considering the resources characteristics, and the method of calculating their capacity proportions with the objective of minimizing cumulative fluctuations were proposed. Then, a large-scale hydro-PV-wind hybrid system sizing model and method considering the electricity transmission requirements and cascade hydropower comprehensive characteristics were proposed, and an optimal capacity decision method based on complementary guarantee rate (CGR) and cumulative time proportion (CTP) was formed. Finally, a case study on the upper reaches of the Yellow River in the Qinghai province of China was used to confirm their feasibility and universality. The results indicated that (1) as the PV capacity proportion increased, the cumulative fluctuations of the total output of PV and wind tended to decrease first and then increase, and the optimum capacity proportion of PV and wind for the multi-energy system was 0.744 and 0.256, respectively; (2) the optimal PV-wind capacity configurations for the world’s largest cascade hydro-PV-wind system under three- and five-segment line transmission modes were 561.2 and 651.8 MW, respectively, and the relationship between CGR, CTP, and wind-PV capacity was quantified; and (3) cascade reservoirs storage performance and solar/wind resources characteristics had a significant impact on energy complementation. Through the coordination of hydraulic and electric power between multiple stations, cascade hydropower can better complement PV/wind. However, the hydro-PV-wind combination had a negative impact on the hydropower daily power generation and the reservoir water level stability. Furthermore, for cascade hydropower, wind-solar configuration capacity should be considered mainly from the perspective of reservoir regulation performance, hydropower installed capacity, and hydropower role allocation. Thus, this sizing method provides new concepts for the large-scale development and application of clean renewable energy sources.

AB  - When a patient needs plastic surgery and there are multiple available surgeons, the patient selects the surgeon based on different criteria. Accommodating patient preference while scheduling such surgeries is important as it is related to patient satisfaction. In this study, we propose a framework for integrating patient preference in an operating room (OR) scheduling problem. To model patient preference to a surgeon, we propose nine criteria: responsive and caring, reputation, professional experiences, communication skills, same ethnicity, same gender, age, same language, and online rating. Fuzzy TOPSIS (namely, Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is then employed to quantify patient preference to surgeons. The outcomes of fuzzy TOPSIS are then fed into a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimize daily surgery schedule. The proposed study is based on a real-life case study that was conducted in a plastic surgery department at a partner hospital. The computational results show that when patient preference to surgeon is considered, more than 70% of patients are assigned to their most preferred surgeons, and less than 5% are assigned to their least preferred surgeons. However, when patient preference is not considered, less than 20% of patients are assigned to most preferred surgeons, and the others are assigned to less preferred surgeons. When it comes to the total costs, the two scenarios results are similar. This concludes that the proposed framework is robust and able to increase patient satisfaction in OR scheduling without sacrificing the total OR operational costs.

AB  - Strategic management researchers have long been fascinated with company performance in terms of underlying managerial cognition and its interpretation. This paper presents a methodology to examine the linkage between the cognition of individuals and company performance. We link cognitive maps with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and examined the role of standard and newly proposed consistency and coverage formulas in the evaluation of social science data. We investigate the effect of cognitive diversity within a company, and between companies within an industry on company performance using experimental and real-life data. The proposed method used a cognitive mapping approach to elicit strategy frames from individuals in management teams and operationalized their cognitive diversity by distance ratios between individual- and group-level cognitive maps. The results highlight the different opportunities of cognitive diversity to the enhancement of company performance in the market and confirm the usefulness of new fsQCA consistency and coverage measures.

This study was performed to identify critical success factors necessary for sustaining organizations’ Lean Six Sigma programs. The research study methodology included: 1) surveying subject matter experts with an open-ended questionnaire approach to identify critical success factors; 2) applying a total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) technique to develop a structural hierarchical interrelation-based model to identify the relationships between the critical factors; 3) integrating fuzzy theory with a Matriced Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée á un Classement (MICMAC) approach to analyze the nature of the critical success factors; and finally 4) validating the structured hierarchical model through application of the structural equation modelling technique. Twenty-nine critical success factors for sustainable Lean Six Sigma were identified, categorized, and prioritized in this research. Management involvement to execute sustainable Lean Six Sigma in an organization and structured sustainable Lean Six Sigma implementation training were identified in this study as the most significant success factors of the twenty-nine factors for successful sustainable Lean Six Sigma implementation. This study provides an essential reference for decision-makers, policymakers, researchers, and practitioners by modeling and validating the interrelationship of critical success factors for Lean Six Sigma implementation. This paper provides a detailed description of the research methodology to enable other researchers and practitioners to perform the same method in other organizations by identifying and extending the set of critical success factor groups.

AB  - This paper proposes a multi-objective renewable energy management scheme to satisfy the needs of diversified community power consumers, wherein the multi-agent system is employed for coordinating and controlling the power generation and consumption units. Firstly, a multi-agent based microgrid and home energy management system is constructed. Subsequently, system models for renewable energy sources, electrical vehicles, residential loads and the cost function are constructed to form the microgrid operation constraints. With these constraints, three optimization models are proposed to minimize the electricity bills, the power purchased from the main grid, and optimize the power quality. The three objectives are proposed to reflect the power consumer’s needs for cost saving, green consumption, and power reliability, respectively. Meanwhile, a coordination strategy which balances the three objectives is proposed. After that, a novel multi agent system is proposed to realize the proposed objectives. Four case studies and a sensitivity analysis are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The case study results show that: in electricity minimization, 2–6.5% of total electricity bills can be saved; in main grid power consumption minimization, the peaks of the power consumption profiles are shaved while the valleys of the profiles are filled; in power quality enhancement, the steady state frequency drop is reduced for 0.35 Hz to 0.38 Hz. The sensitivity analysis shows that communities equipped with energy storage systems accounting for 30% of the total load can achieve best optimization outcomes; the increase in renewable energy usage will lead to higher electricity bills and poorer power quality if the renewable energy sources are limited, while the availability of more renewable energy sources will compensate for the negative effects of using renewable energy sources.

AB  - Uncertainties in acquisition, processing, market, and other stages of the closed-loop supply chain have greatly added to the complexity of remanufacturing and have reduced process efficiency, impeding the sustainable development of industries and circular economy. Recently, an increasing number of studies have been published that focus on the uncertainty analysis of closed-loop supply chain. Thus, this article aims to examine previous research on the uncertainties that are inherent characteristics of a closed-loop supply chain, and to provide constructive prospects for future research. Based on these aims, we selected 302 papers published in the “Web of Science” core database from 2004 to 2018. We analyze the causes of uncertainties at different stages, and identify appropriate methods for quantifying the impacts of the uncertainties on production processes. As a result, from a macro level, and based on a visualization method, we present the themes, development, and evolution of popular research topics in the previous literature. From a micro level, and based on the methodology, we conduct a systematic evaluation of uncertainty factors, methods, and solutions. Finally, we clarify a breakthrough point for future research. By optimizing the impacts of uncertainties on closed-loop supply chain, we can effectively and efficiently realize sustainable development and cleaner production in a closed-loop supply chain.

AB  - This study strives to find the different possible combinations of three relevant image cues (i.e., country-of-origin image, corporate image, and brand image) which optimally predict the purchase intention of a foreign-made product. A sample of 314 Canadian participants was used to assess their image perceptions and purchase intention of a Chinese product. Data were analysed using the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results reveal that there are two configurations. The first one represents consumers whose purchase intention is shaped by the country-of-origin-image, the corporate image, but excluding the brand image. The second configuration combines the country-of-origin image and the brand image, but excludes the corporate image. Because the country-of-origin image continues to play an important role in influencing consumers' behavioural intention, international marketers need to meticulously assess consumers’ perceptions of countries from which the product originates. Also, companies should consider the hybrid approach with respect to their branding strategy. Accordingly, they can consider a branded house strategy in some cases, while considering a house of brands strategy in other cases. This study contributes to the literature by attempting to close the debate on the relationships among the three image cues (i.e., which variable is the precursor of the other), but opens new perspectives for marketing scholars and invites them to delve into the topic by investigating the possible combinations of different marketing information cues (e.g., image cues) that may lead to an optimal outcome for the consumer and the firm.

AB  - Due to the heterogeneity nature and the huge number of published cloud services, as well as, the continuous increase of the users’ complexity demands, the discovery process of cloud services remains an open issue. According to our conducted comprehensive survey study, the existing cloud service discovery solutions suffer from a set of drawbacks; missing a standardized and comprehensive specification of cloud services, not considering the lack of knowledge about cloud concepts, and not considering the continuous increase of the complex cloud services published to meet the complexity of the users’ demands. In this paper, a comprehensive, standardized, flexible, and intelligent cloud service discovery framework is proposed to overcome these drawbacks. According to this framework, a comprehensive ontology has been developed to provide a standardized semantic specification of cloud services based on their functional features and non-functional features. For exploiting the high performance of the relational databases in managing the large amounts of data and improving the effectiveness of the proposed framework, instances of the non- functional features’ ontological concepts are separated from the developed ontology to be stored in a relational database, where Ontop OBDA platform is used to translate the complex queries over the ontology to SQL queries that are understood by the underlying relational database source. Also, our proposed framework provides a user-centric interface that enables users with low knowledge about cloud concepts to compose complex queries using their natural English language. The effectiveness evaluation shows that the proposed framework provides better results than other solutions. According to the implementation results, the average amount of error expected to identify a service by using the proposed framework is 11% compared to 31% by using the Cloudle service discovery solution. Also, the framework achieves entirely the cloud service discovery evaluation criteria compared to 66% of these criteria for the current cloud service discovery solutions. For efficiency, the proposed framework achieves 88% F-Score for mapping cloud services into suitable functional features and 80% for discovering services that match the users’ queries.

AB  - As IT industries grow at a faster pace, cloud technology becomes inevitable. Attracted by the scope, many cloud vendors (CVs) arise. A rational/systematic selection is an urge to tackle the scalability of CVs. To circumvent the issue, in this paper, a framework is proposed for CV selection under with probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs). The PLTS is a flexible structure that allows partial ignorance of occurring probabilities. Initially, attributes’ weights are calculated using a programming model, which uses partial information effectively. Later, decision-makers’ (DMs’) weights are computed by integrating evidence theory with Bayes approximation. Preferences from DMs are aggregated by proposing a two-way operator, which aggregates linguistic preferences using the rule-based method and occurring probabilities using Maclaurin symmetric mean. Moreover, CVs are ranked by using an integrated PROMETHEE–Borda method under the PLTS. Further, to test the validity of the framework, a case study on CV selection is presented for a small-scale company. Finally, the advantages and limitations of the proposed framework are investigated by comparison with other methods and the results infer that (i) the proposed framework is 63.67% robust even after adequate changes are made to the alternatives; (ii) the proposed framework is 87.67% robust even after adequate changes are made to the attributes; (iii) from partial adequacy test, the robustness is determined as 77.67% and 92.33%; and (iv) from the broadness test, the proposed framework produces an average deviation of 9% among their rank values, which is better than the extant models that produce an average deviation close to 7.8%.

AB  - Background
The integrated healthcare of patients with support needs in primary healthcare in Austria has insufficient structural and procedural features in terms of the quality and security of care. The aim is therefore to develop solution- and patient-oriented services that take into account both the patients’ requirements as well as the medical, nursing, therapeutic and economic perspectives. The question arises: What relevant levers can support the active participation of social work in the primary healthcare of patients with support needs in Austria?
Methods
An adapted Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to investigate the levers for integrating social work into primary healthcare networks in Austria. In addition to a semi-structured literature search, subjective expert and user priorities were surveyed, cause-and-effect relationships were visualized, an extended cycle of success was developed and relevant control levers were identified by means of a pair comparison matrix and an effectiveness front.
Results
This results in the targeted development and optimization of the complex integration of social work into primary healthcare in Austria, the relevant levers being the professionalization of social work, competences of social work, communication and cooperation of stakeholders.
Conclusion
The identified levers have to be processed conceptually and operationally. For this purpose, an integrated concept has to be developed, which, in addition to innovative organizational instruments, includes special communication approaches as well as inter-professional process and knowledge management.

AB  - In recent years, as the world has witnessed many social issues and environmental disasters, philanthropic giving has become widespread. Today, crowdfunding platforms have also become popular, and charities often use these to fundraise. However, they rarely utilize the power of social networking to assist a fundraiser in discovering potential donors, and this is especially true for small organizations and individuals. In this research, we propose a recommendation mechanism for social fundraising that analyzes the donor's preferences, the relationship between the donor and fundraiser, and the characteristics of the fundraising dynamics to promote the spread of philanthropic fundraising. The proposed mechanism can effectively discover appropriate donors and relevant campaigns to expedite the fundraising process and improve its success rate.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel solution technique for the multi-objective linguistic optimization problems (MOLOPs) based on the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic approach. The proposed approach has two main advantages. First, it can handle the MOLOPs in which the linguistic information are represented through either monotonic or non-monotonic functions. Second, for both the scenarios, it provides unique solutions in the linguistic form. On the other hand, the existing MOLOP solution approach which is based on the Tsukamoto’s inference method, provides unique solutions only for those MOLOPs in which the linguistic information are expressed as monotonic functions. For the MOLOPs, in which the linguistic information are expressed as non-monotonic functions, the Tsukamoto’s inference method based solution approach cannot provide unique solutions. Moreover, for both monotonic and non-monotonic cases, the Tsukamoto’s inference method based solution approach cannot provide linguistic solutions, but gives only numeric solutions. We have demonstrated the applicability of the proposed MOLOP solution approach considering a case study on student’s performance evaluation, and compared the results with the Tsukamoto’s inference method based solution approach. It is observed that the proposed approach is capable of addressing the limitations of the Tsukamoto’s inference method and hence is more suitable in solving MOLOPs.

KW  - Road safety
AB  - Evaluating road safety is an important issue for policy makers. One of the most important model for evaluation of road safety is data envelopment analysis-based road safety (DEA-RS). Conventional DEA-RS model is unable to consider decision makers’ (DMs) judgements in the evaluations and also suffers from weight flexibility of input and output variables. In this paper, to incorporate DMs’ preferences into decision making process and overcome the weight flexibility shortcoming of DEA-RS model, DEA-RS is combined with group best-worst method (BWM). For considering the preferences, a group BWM is proposed. The proposed model is applied to estimate the road safety efficiency in provinces of Iran. The results show that developed provinces such as Tehran has the safest roads in Iran. In contrast, provinces with poor road facilities are unsafe provinces in roads. At last, to improve the road safety performances, managerial implications and recommendations have been made for policy makers.

AB  - China has implemented the “2 + 26 Cities” policy for the air pollution collaborative supervision in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, it is necessary to conduct an effectiveness assessment of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei air pollution prevention and control (APPC). Therefore, this paper proposes a complete evaluation model for Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei APPC to solve this problem and help decision makers (DMs) reasonably allocate limited resources. First of all, we establish an index system which consists of four parts: supervisory capacity, environmental effects, social effects and economic effects. Second, triangle intuitionistic fuzzy number (TIFN) is applied to describe the index data to better adapt the actual situation. Third, combining Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) with the entropy methods, the approach is utilized to calculate the index weights. Fourth, considering DMs' evaluation greyscale, grey fuzzy synthetic evaluation eliminates the defects caused by subjective preferences to a certain extent, which makes the evaluation results more reasonable. Fifth, sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis are performed to verify the reliability of evaluation results. Finally, the effectiveness assessment results show the overall Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei APPC is good, and we put forward some policy implications to further improve Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei APPC level.

AB  - Satisfaction with life scale is a comprehensive cognitive judgement of individual’s own life and becomes the dominant measure of life satisfaction. However, the individual may hesitate to assess his/her life satisfaction with a single value due to multiple criteria. Consequently, we propose the hesitant fuzzy satisfaction with life scale (HFSWLS) with the same form as hesitant fuzzy element (HFE), consisting of several possible values of the cognitive judgements to describe the uncertainties and hesitancies. In this paper, we propose a novel aggregation method for large scale HFEs and apply it to HFSWLSs. Primarily, we present the necessary requirements of the extension rules for HFEs to guarantee the reversibility and linearity of the proposed operators. In the proposed aggregation method, we cluster the individuals based on their feature values and further define the hesitant fuzzy feature pair to find out the abnormal HFEs. We generate each cluster’s center HFE by the proposed operators in the first-round aggregation. Based on the orness degree relating to the cluster’s feature value and the decision makers’ preferences to cluster’s feature value, we derive the weights of the center HFEs by O’Hagan’s nonlinear optimization, leading to the final aggregation result taking into account the actual demand. Finally, the validity and effectiveness of the proposed aggregation method for HFEs are testified by the application of HFSWLSs of the citizens.

KW  - Feasibility
AB  - A recent article in this journal claimed to assess the socio-technical potential for onshore wind energy in Europe. We find the article to be severely flawed and raise concerns in five general areas. Firstly, the term socio-technical is not precisely defined, and is used by the authors to refer to a potential that others term as merely technical. Secondly, the study fails to account for over a decade of research in wind energy resource assessments. Thirdly, there are multiple issues with the use of input data and, because the study is opaque about many details, the effect of these errors cannot be reproduced. Fourthly, the method assumes a very high wind turbine capacity density of 10.73 MW/km2 across 40% of the land area in Europe with a generic 30% capacity factor. Fifthly, the authors find an implausibly high onshore wind potential, with 120% more capacity and 70% more generation than the highest results given elsewhere in the literature. Overall, we conclude that new research at higher spatial resolutions can make a valuable contribution to wind resource potential assessments. However, due to the missing literature review, the lack of transparency and the overly simplistic methodology, Enevoldsen et al. (2019) potentially mislead fellow scientists, policy makers and the general public.

KW  - Boolean factor analysis
AB  - Formal concept analysis (FCA) has been widely studied as an important tool for data processing and knowledge discovery. The present work focuses on FCA under uncertainty while the attributes are described with linguistic terms or attribute description are incomplete. Accordingly, a linguistic concept formal context is introduced first. With an attempt of knowledge reduction, the multi-granularity similarity relationship between linguistic concepts is defined on the basis of granular computing which further divides the linguistic concept set into three parts under λ-granularity (i.e., core linguistic concept, unnecessary linguistic concept, and relative necessary linguistic concept). A multi-granularity linguistic reduction algorithm of incomplete linguistic concept formal context is then introduced. To handle the incompleteness, a new algorithm to complete the incomplete linguistic concept formal context based on the closeness degree between fuzzy objects is proposed. Finally, based on the Boolean matrix and Boolean factor analysis method, the linguistic concept knowledge reduction algorithm to extract the core linguistic concept and reduce the scale of linguistic concept lattice is proposed to handle the complexity, which is achieved by computing the similarity of linguistic concept knowledge in order to handle different types of linguistic information and concept knowledge. The effectiveness and practicability of the proposed model are illustrated by examples.

AB  - Data fusion can effectively reduce the amount of data transmission and network energy consumption in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However the existing data fusion schemes lead to additional delay overhead and power consumptions. In order to improve the performance of WSNs, an intelligent data fusion algorithm based on hybrid delay-aware clustering (HDC) in WSNs is proposed, which combines the advantages of single-layer cluster structure and multi-layer cluster structure, and adaptive selects the clustering patterns of the cluster by the decision function to achieve the tradeoff between network delay and energy consumption. The network model of HDC is presented, and theoretical analysis of the delay and energy consumption of single-layer cluster and multi-layer cluster are provided. And the energy efficient clustering algorithm and the dynamic cluster head re-selection algorithm are proposed to optimize network energy consumption and load balancing of the network. Simulation results show that, compared with the existing delay-aware models, the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the network delay, network energy consumption, and extend the network lifetime simultaneously.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology to improve the identification of causal relationships of an existing strategy map of a company, using a multi-decision criteria method. A strategy map is one of the components of a balanced scorecard (BSC). It contains strategic objectives grouped into four perspectives and the cause-effect link between those objectives. There is no “standard” method for identifying those relationships. In many companies, they are identified conceptually, using the experience and knowledge of the company's managers. Even though, the literature presents a number of articles using multicriteria decision methods to model a balanced scorecard, only a few of them deal with the identification of the causal relationships. However, t is assumed (by the authors) that the strategy map obtained using their method is better than strategy map that would have been obtained using only the judgment of managers. This paper does not assume that and this is the reason why the existing strategy map (or a map obtained using a qualitative approach) is combined with a map obtained by using a quantitative method to arrive to a final strategy map. This is the contribution of the paper. The method uses the Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method to identify the relationships of a strategy map. Then the resulting map is compared with the existing strategy map (or a map obtained using a qualitative approach). To identify the similarities and differences the K-means clustering method is used. From those similarities and differences found, it is decided which causal relationships will be included in the final strategy map. As an illustration, the application of the proposed methodology in a manufacturing company is shown.

This study includes several operating parameters such as lean amine temperature and pressure, feed gas temperature and pressure, regenerator feed temperature and pressure, feed flow rate, etc. Environmental and economic optimization criteria are considered using four cases comprising of several conflicting objectives like net profit, global warming potential, and acidification potential under two-objective and three-objective optimization scenarios. Constraints are imposed on H2S content and CO2 content as per the maximum permissible limit. Pareto optimal fronts are found for different cases and trade-offs between different objectives are illustrated. Simultaneous effects of different variables together on the conflicting objectives are considered to analyze the sweetening process to get a more economical and environmentally friendly process.

The study proposes an integrated bibliometric approach to detect the knowledge evolution, domain and frontier with a broader searching scope compared with manual review. A total of 752 peer-reviewed academic papers published until the end of 2017 are used. The knowledge evolution indicates seven milestones in history, namely, stakeholder concept, method, identification, assessment, management, influence and complexity. The identified knowledge domain consists of four major research areas which are society, sustainability, analytical tool and project management. The knowledge frontier is also revealed, including a dearth of detailed discussions on stakeholder engagement in sustainable urban projects, lack of generalisation of stakeholder studies in complex construction projects, limited application of dynamic and simulation stakeholder analysis in uncertain project environment and few instant and accurate approaches to integrate stakeholder information. The study provides a holistic knowledge map for the past, current and future of stakeholder perspective studies in construction projects.

AB  - Technical energy regulations are an important measure to reach climate targets. However, with recent developments in new technologies (such as decentralized energy systems, urban energy systems, energy storage systems, etc.) many different options and combination of measures exist to decarbonize the building stock, which requires an update of current versions of technical energy regulations. The aim of this work is to investigate the optimal transformation strategies for buildings and districts to reach CO2 emission reduction targets for the Swiss building stock, to support policies and decision makers in developing new energy regulations for the future. A simulation approach is developed, which combines clustering methods, to define representative buildings and districts, with multi-objective optimization to investigate the optimal set of building and district measures to minimize costs and CO2 emissions. Results at building level show that the most economical measures for reaching emission targets for the future include roof retrofitting and window replacement together with PV installation. In terms of heating systems, biomass or heat pumps seem to be the most favourable option. The analysis of district archetypes shows that district level solutions are mainly applicable to urban communities, whereas building level solutions are clearly the optimal solution for rural areas.

AB  - Graphical variable message signs (VMSs) are infrastructure-based advanced traveler information systems widely used to provide drivers with real-time traffic condition information about a road section or area. However, there is a lack of research on the suitable volume of information to be shown on graphical VMSs. In practice, an overload of VMS information commonly exists, especially on China’s highways. Building on our earlier findings obtained through surveys and static cognitive experiments, this study introduces the use of dynamic simulation experiments to assess the influence of the volume of information (i.e., number of roads displayed) on graphical VMSs from the perspective of drivers’ visual perception characteristics. Thirty-two drivers participated in the driving simulation experiment and questionnaires. Five indexes, including legibility speed, legibility distance, legibility time, comprehension accuracy, and driver subjective scoring, were thoroughly analyzed to evaluate their relationships to different volumes of information (i.e., four, five, and six roads shown on a VMS). The results show that the legibility distance notably decreased with increasing volumes of information. The comprehension accuracy decreased significantly when the number of roads shown increased to six. The legibility speed, legibility time, and subjective scoring also deteriorated as the number of roads displayed on the VMS increased. The index scores were evaluated, in combination with the data of the drivers’ subjective scoring, data-based statistical analyses, and comprehensive evaluations using the TOPSIS method, to recommend that five is the recommended maximum number of roads to be shown on a graphical VMS. The results of this study support the goal of providing understandable and effective messages for drivers by addressing issues relating to how much information should be displayed on a VMS. These findings provide a basis for policy development to ensure consistent and practical designs of graphical VMSs on highways.

AB  - Mainly due to global warming, ice melting in the Arctic is accelerating and this trend is expected to continue, which will provide another efficient alternative sea route between Western Europe and East Asia for marine transportation of goods. Compared to the existing Suez Canal Route, the Northern Sea Route will be economically attractive and viable opportunity in international trade aspects for the two parties. European countries as well as East Asian countries are trying to benefit from it by actively participating in several activities towards development and commercialization of the Arctic route. As transport through the Arctic route continues to develop, we investigate beneficial (competitive) impact of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) on three Asian countries (China, Korea, and Japan) and four major European counterpart countries (the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France). For the study we use grey relational analysis with four quantitative influence factors (distance, transport cost, iceberg cost, and trade volume) to rank countries by their commercial benefits from opening the NSR. Beneficial effect on each country can be summarized as follows: (i) for European countries, the ranking order is the Netherlands>Germany>the United Kingdom>France; (ii) for Asian countries, the ranking order is Japan>Korea>China. The overall ranking results show that the Netherlands and Japan benefit most from opening the NSR.

AB  - Blockchain has the potential to improve the efficiency and transparency of maritime businesses and operations. Nevertheless, few studies have been conducted to identify the key challenges and critical success factors (CSFs) of blockchain implementation in the maritime industry. A case study approach based on Singapore’s maritime industry is adopted. Four interviews are conducted to establish the face validity of the survey questionnaire before data are collected from 30 maritime professionals from Singapore’s maritime industry. In addition to analytic hierarchical process (AHP), a fishbone diagram and PESTEL analysis are also adopted to organize and discuss the results. The results show that there are six key challenges and six CSFs for blockchain implementation. Using a fishbone diagram, the six identified challenges along with 13 personal concerns are categorized into five dimensions related to people, methods, organization, external environment, and technology. The CSFs are sufficient capital, staff training, ease of local legislation, support from the shipping community, support from the senior management, and professional consultation and assistance. This study implicates marine policy formulation in relation to subsidies and investments, blockchain talent and knowledge acquisition, and workforce training and education to accelerate blockchain implementation in the maritime industry.

AB  - More than two decades since the reforms process was introduced in the Indian power sector, distribution losses, are still higher than the desirable levels, and continue to pose challenges for the viability of the entire sector. Adoption of loss reduction technologies (LRTs) is crucial to address high distribution losses and, improve quality and reliability of supply. These, in turn, can raise consumer satisfaction and can also help distribution utilities in improving their financial performance. Although power sector reforms, implemented through a number of policy and regulatory initiatives, emphasize distribution performance improvement, LRT adoption by distribution utilities has generally remained limited. Conceptualizing technology adoption and reforms from a new institutional economics perspective, this paper provides a systematic approach for identification and classification of barriers to LRT adoption to guide future distribution reforms. Based on literature review and stakeholders survey, thirteen barriers are identified and classified at three levels of governance – sector, utility and sector-consumer interaction. Further, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to rank the barriers. Results suggest that future reforms should focus on the improvement in utility-level governance, unlike the present focus on sector-level governance.

AB  - The application of heuristic algorithms with life cycle assessment (LCA) is a promising approach to efficiently optimize the building and minimize the environmental impact even in a very large design space. In this paper, a modular parametric optimization framework combining advanced building modelling, LCA, energy calculation and single- and multi-objective environmental optimization was developed and applied to a multi-apartment house in Hungary. The variables comprise geometry, envelope, fixtures, as well as the heating energy source. The objective is the life cycle environmental impact expressed in terms of the six most common LCA indicators. The results show that a relatively compact shape, large windows to south equipped with shading and very high levels of insulation are optimal from an environmental perspective. It was also proven that focusing only on the embodied or operational impact leads to a suboptimal solution, and the choice of the energy source for the operation of the building has a significant influence on the achievable optimum. Through the optimization, significant environmental savings of 60–80% were achieved compared to the initial design options showing the potential for the application of such methods in architectural design.

AB  - With the increasing emphasis on environmental problems and climate change, renewable energy sources have been developed globally to push modern power systems towards sustainability. However, the weather-dependent and non-dispatchable features of renewable energy sources often hinder their integration into power grids and also pose a challenge for peak load regulation. Recently, the complementary operation of multi-energy hybrid systems has been attracting increasing attention as a promising way to overcome the mismatch between renewable energy supply and varying load demand. Multi-energy systems should be operated considering multiple uncertainties since a deterministic method only captures a fixed snapshot of a constantly changing system. In this study, the obtained short-term peak shaving operation of a hydro-wind-photovoltaic hybrid system is developed as a stochastic programming model. The uncertainties of renewable energy production and load demand are thoroughly simulated in the form of synthetic ensemble forecasts and scenario trees. To enhance the computational efficiency, a parallel particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to solve the stochastic peak shaving model, in which a novel encoding scheme and parallel computing strategy are used. The proposed framework is applied to a hydro-wind-photovoltaic hybrid system of the East China Power Grid. The results of three numerical experiments indicate that the framework can achieve satisfactory peak shaving performance of the power system and enable decision makers to examine the robustness of operational decisions. In addition, it is acceptable for decision makers that joint complementary operation of the hybrid system greatly enhances the peak shaving capacity (with the performance metrics being improved by 95.7%, 96.4% and 30.5%) at the cost of 0.11% loss of total power generation.

AB  - Although large firms have already begun addressing energy efficiency issues and adopting “cleaner” types of energy, companies with fewer resources, such as small and medium-sized enterprises, are more reluctant to implement these measures. Given that strategies leading to energy sustainability have become a key aspect of business competitiveness, decision makers in small and medium-sized enterprises could clearly benefit from a new approach that provides a better understanding of energy-change impacts on their business activities. The present study combined fuzzy cognitive mapping and the system dynamics approach to develop an informed, transparent model for use in analyses of energy-change effects on the sustainability of small and medium-sized enterprises. This dual methodology facilitated an examination of cause-and-effect relationships between decision criteria and the clarification of dynamic interactions between variables from a holistic, real-world perspective, thereby enriching the extant literature. The results of the proposed decision-support system were validated by two senior staff members of the Directorate for Energy Sustainability Services of Portugal’s Directorate General for Energy and Geology. The advantages, limitations, and implications of our constructivist, process-oriented framework for research and practice are also discussed.

AB  - Recently, the increase in energy demand motivated the researchers to study renewable energy sources. A significant portion of energy is consumed in transportation. Biofuels such as biodiesel are significant renewable sources of energy that can be utilized in this sector. In Asian countries such as Iran, with widespread use of diesel engines, biodiesel engines are likely to be combined in the system without modifications, since they share similar functionalities with diesel engines. Biodiesels can be extracted from different feedstocks such as microalgae that can grow in Iran. To perform a thorough analysis of the development of biodiesel in Iran, this paper applied strength-weakness-opportunity-threat (SWOT) structure to obtain suitable strategies. These strategies are ranked using a group decision-making method in fuzzy linguistic environment. Step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) is employed to weight the criteria, while fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) is utilized to consider casual relationships. Finally, weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) is utilized to rank the strategies. As indicated in the results, a necessity in third-generation biodiesel production from microalgae is support by government with subsidy and financial policies. Additionally, developing technologies and encouraging private sectors to invest in this area are important strategies as well.

AB  - Automated negotiation on qualitative issues taking linguistic values poses the challenge of computation of their offer values while generating proposals/counter-proposals. In order to make the offer values computable for the qualitative issues just as quantitative issues, the proposed flexible negotiation strategies (FlexiNegoS+) for e-commerce negotiations, generate a triangular fuzzy number corresponding to each linguistic value of the qualitative issue from which numerical reservation values are identified. JADE based mobile agent named as ‘JADETraderPal’ has been designed and embedded with FlexiNegoS+ which can act on behalf of its owner in bilateral/multilateral single-issue/multi-issue dynamic e-commerce negotiation environments. The negotiation model of FlexiNegoS+ enables JADETraderPal to make adjustable rate of concession during each proposal/counter-proposal depending upon the dynamicity of the e-market. Performance of JADETraderPal and effectiveness of FlexiNegoS+ are evaluated by developing a prototype multi-agent system representing bilateral/multilateral negotiation scenarios with parameters such as turnaround time, deal success rate and traders’ utility. The empirical results prove that JADETraderPal outperforms static agents, improves the rate of reaching consensus and maximizes the utility of its owner. JADETraderPal demonstrated robust performance even in multi-lateral negotiations and is able to increase negotiation success rates and traders’ utility in multi-lateral negotiation scenarios than in bilateral negotiation environments.

AB  - In the present competitive business environment and era of globalized marketing, supply chain (SC) of the leather industry is facing a variety of risks. Hence, one of the fundamental concerns in the leather industry supply chain (LISC) is recognizing and prioritizing the various risk factors for attaining sustainability. The present study is an attempt to determine a comprehensive evaluation of SC risk factors considering the case of the leather industry. Based on the literature search and interviews with the domain experts’, forty-four risk factors in the context of LISC are identified. The identified risk factors are further segregated into five-dimensions to sustainability (social, environmental, economic, technical, and institutional). A Pareto analysis is performed to discover the most pertinent risk factors. Further, the best-worst method (BWM) is embraced for evaluating the importance of each pertinent risk factor for the decision-making purpose. The findings from the study reflect that ‘inefficient effluent treatment’, ‘change in consumer preference’, ‘improper dumping of solid waste’, ‘volatility of price and cost’ and ‘fiscal changes’ are the crucial risk factors that are required to be addressed for the successful execution of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices in an emerging economy context. It is expected that the results and findings will assist the leather industry managers in decision-making for better administration and alleviation of supply chain risks to achieve sustainability.

AB  - Over-extraction of groundwater has compromised its climatic resilience properties and the arid/semi-arid rural tracts are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the risks of groundwater scarcity. This study has employed a combination of Geographical Information System (GIS) and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) techniques to delineate the Groundwater Potential Zones (GPZs) of the semi-arid Birbhum district in eastern India which suffers from seasonal drought during lean periods. For a reliable evaluation, a large number of thematic layers (N = 12) including geology, geomorphology, Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), fault and lineament density, drainage density, rainfall, soil type, slope, roughness, topographic wetness index, topographic position index and curvature were considered for this assessment. Multicollinearity and consistency checks were performed prior integrating the layers to avoid a non-trivial degree of accuracy in prediction output. The GPZ map was obtained with an accuracy of 80.49% with respect to the observation tube well data. Based on the obtained output, 38.24%, 24.24% and 11.14% of areas of the district classified as moderate, poor, and very poor GPZs, respectively, whereas only 26.38% of the district classified as high to very high GPZs. Cross-validation using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve revealed a good prediction accuracy of 71.50%. Furthermore, map removal and single parameter sensitivity analysis was also performed which revealed geology, geomorphology, soil types, rainfall, LULC and lineament density as the most influential parameters for the prediction model where exclusion of any thematic layer significantly changes the prediction accuracy and area of each GPZ class. The most convincing GPZs are recorded in some parts of the Mayurakshi and Ajay river basins and certain alluvial aquifer regions. Nonetheless, the study recommends the adaptation of Managed Aquifer Recharge techniques including rainwater harvesting, alternative cropping patterns and irrigation techniques such as sprinklers, drips and micro irrigations to increase the groundwater potential of the water crisis zones.

AB  - The Granites-Tanami Orogen (GTO), a poorly exposed component of the North Australian Craton, is host to significant Paleoproterozoic orogenic gold mineralization amounting to a total endowment of greater 20 Moz Au. This study adopted a multi-technique approach to mineral potential modelling (MPM) of orogenic gold deposits in the GTO, using four different techniques: Continuous fuzzy gamma, geometric average and data-driven index overlay and data-driven random forest methods. The predictive models generated in this study delivered the first public-domain gold prospectivity maps for the Northern Territory (NT)-portion of the GTO. The predictor maps at the core of these models represent mappable proxies of mineralizing processes believed to have been critical in the formation of the orogenic gold deposits, and were generated in the framework of a mineral systems approach. Normalized density, prediction-area and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve methods were used to test the robustness of these predictors and determine the most effective. The performance of the gold potential models generated in this study was assessed using the improved prediction-area plot procedure, with the data-driven random forest approach having delivered the best performing model. The multi-technique approach taken in this study, in which multiple mineral potential models are generated for the same study area and using the same predictor maps, is a relatively new and, as of yet, underutilized approach to MPM that, in contrast to the standard procedure (i.e., generation of a single data- or knowledge-driven model) ensures optimal utilization of the available conceptual and empirical information, helps to better understand and minimize stochastic and systemic uncertainties, facilitates cross-validation of the resulting prospectivity models, and allows the resulting models to be compared and contrasted. From a practical, exploration point of view, the models served as decision-support tools that helped to improve confidence in targeting underexplored, gold-prospective areas in the GTO more effectively and identify new search areas previously not recognized as areas of high gold potential.

AB  - The design optimization of mechanical system components, like bearings, pulleys, springs, etc. is an essential issue due to the current competitive market. The performance of any mechanical system depends on the design of their mechanical components. The design optimization of these mechanical components is a difficult task due to the intricate design constraints and mixed type design variables (i.e., continuous, discrete, and integer). This paper explores the performance of Rao algorithms on the design optimization of selected mechanical system components. The designs obtained using Rao algorithms are compared with the designs obtained using other optimization algorithms in previous studies. The comparison of results shows the ability and the efficiency of Rao algorithms for solving complex design optimization problems of mechanical components.

AB  - Composition of municipal solid waste (MSW) is rapidly changed along with socioeconomic factors, especially in developing countries. Understanding the association between MSW composition and socioeconomic factors is therefore instrumental when deciding types of technologies and optimizing management strategies. In the past decades, Taiwan has gradually evolved from an agricultural society to a post-industrial society through industrialization and urbanization. This study collects a 12-year worth of self-reported dataset in Taiwan, including MSW, individual and household social-economic factors, in order to unveil their relationships. Our analysis is based on multivariate approach. The results indicate that the major socioeconomic factors that dominate the MSW composition were safety concerns, economic activities, and lifestyle. Overall, MSW composition is increasingly complex as the economy experiences more prosperity, and there is an upward trend of recyclable wastes. Moreover, kitchen waste represents a distinct pattern between urban and rural communities, coupled with the contribution of total waste. Consistent with other countries, paper waste is increased in commensurate with the growth of economy. Interestingly, contrasting to the global trend, plastics and glass wastes generation rate decline when the economy expands economic activities. This attributes mainly to the strict enforcement of recycling policies accompanied with marketing campaigns that encourage recycling and enhance consumers’ green awareness. Strategies that facilitate modifying consumers’ socioeconomic factors and changing consumers’ behavior could play an important role in management of MSW in other developing countries.

AB  - In this paper we propose a computational approach that applies data mining techniques to analyze the citizen participation recorded in an online digital platform. Differently to previous work, the approach exploits external knowledge extracted from Open Government Data for processing the citizens’ proposals and debates of the platform, enabling to characterize targeted issues and problems, and analyze the levels of discussion, support and controversy raised by the proposals. As a result of our analysis, we derive a number of insights and conclusions of interest and value for both citizens and government stakeholders in decision and policy making tasks. Among others, we show that proposals targeting issues that affect large majorities tend to be supported by citizens and ultimately implemented by the city council, but leave aside other very important issues affecting minority groups. Our study reveals that most controversial, likely relevant, problems do not always receive sufficient attention in e-participation. Moreover, it identifies several types of controversy, related to ideological and socioeconomic factors and political attitudes.

AB  - Due to high consumption of energy, its associated concerns such as energy security and demand, wastage of resources, and material-energy recovery are leading to the importance of sustainable energy system development. This is a high time to assess the sustainability in energy systems for meeting the requirements of energy with an enhanced economic, ecological, and social performance from a nation context. The energy system plays a significant role in deciding the economic progress of emerging economies such as India, China, Brazil, and Africa. In this paper, an original attempt has been made to list and evaluate important indicators for sustainability assessment of energy systems development and management in an emerging economy especially India. Firstly, based on the analysis of the extant literature and then followed by expert opinion, potential key sustainability assessment indicators for energy systems development and management were identified. Further, grey based Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique to understand the causal interactions amongst indicators and segregate them into cause and effect groups, is used. This work can provide useful aids to decision making bodies, sustainability practitioners and business organisations in selective implementation, monitoring and control of sustainable strategies in energy systems development and management and meeting sustainable development goals of clean energy in a nation context.

AB  - To be acceptably safe one must identify the risks one is exposed to and decide what risk reducing measures are required. It is uncertain whether the threat really will materialize, but determining the size and probability of the risk is also full of uncertainty. When performing an analysis and preparing for decision making under uncertainty, quite frequently failure rate data, information on consequence severity or on a probability value, yes, even on the possibility that an event can or cannot occur, is lacking. In those cases, a possible way and sometimes the only way to proceed is to revert to expert judgment. Even in case historical data is available, an expert can be asked whether and to what extent such data still hold in the current situation. Anyhow, expert elicitation comes with an uncertainty depending on the expert's reliability, which becomes very visible when two or more experts give different answers or even conflicting answers. This is not a new problem, and very bright minds have thought how to tackle this in a rational and objective way. But so far, however, the topic has not been given much attention in daily process safety and risk assessment practice. Therefore, this paper has a review and applied character and will present various approaches with detailed explanation and examples.

KW  - Waste minimization
AB  - The concept of circular economy (CE), a recent popular global business trend, considerably minimizes waste and environmental pollution. However, studies exploring CE practices in the context of leather industry have been scant. To deal with this issue, this paper proposes a decision support framework for evaluating the challenges to CE practices in the context of leather industry. Best worst method, a generic decision support tool, is employed in the assessment process. The study findings reveal that “lack of financial support from authorities” is assigned the highest weight in the final ranking results. This indicates that the lack of financial facility poses a major challenge to the successful implementation of CE practices. The findings can assist industrial managers and authorities in taking the required actions to implement CE practices in the leather industry for the sustainable development of the leather sector.

AB  - During the response phase of an emergency, decision makers manage processes that save lives, protect infrastructure and contain evolving threats. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive survey of the emergency response operations literature. In collating and classifying our literature sample, we employ novel methodologies adapted from unsupervised learning and network analysis to reduce sampling and expectancy biases. We find that operations research supporting emergency response has been developing in discernible clusters, with each cluster of studies focused on a particular process such as evacuation or aid distribution. Our study both serves to strengthen the theoretical foundation of emergency response operations and identifies plentiful opportunities for researchers seeking to advance the state-of-the-art in this exciting frontier of operations research.

AB  - Epoxy nanocomposites play a leading role in manufacturing sectors due to excellent engineering properties. This paper highlights the influence of process constraints and the development of a robust optimization approach during drilling of Multiwall carbon nanotube/Epoxy Nanocomposites. The parameters considered are MWCNT % (W), Drill bit speed (N), feed rate (F), and Drill Bit (M) Materials (HSS, Carbide, TiAlN) based on pilot experiments performed and existing literature. The unified aim is to achieve the best machining performances, i.e., Surface roughness, Torque, and Thrust force. The optimal setting was found as W-1.0%, N-1000 rpm, F-50 mm/min with TiAlN drill bit. A comparative study between GRA and GRA-PCA hybrid modules has been performed to check the application potential, which shows that Hybrid GRA-PCA is more capable than traditional GRA in terms of less average error (5.037%) and overall improvement of 13.99% in assessment values.

AB  - A low-carbon lifestyle is an inevitable choice for mitigating climate change. However, in the actual situation where policy makers and policy target groups are separated from each other, low-carbon lifestyle changes are often manifested as individual strong government actions, behind which social actions are seriously lagging. Based on this observation, in this study a concept of policy utility dislocation was developed, and a policy utility dislocation model was constructed based on prospect theory. Numerical simulation showed that policy utility dislocation can be reduced by increasing the proportion of residents’ environmental benefits, government efforts and subsidies, and reducing the cost of implementing a low-carbon lifestyle for residents. In particular, when the environmental benefits of the government and residents accounted for 15% and 65%, respectively, or the subsidy coefficient was 2, the policy utility dislocation became zero. In addition, policy utility dislocation began to appear when the cost of implementing a low carbon lifestyle exceeded 3. This study enriches the connotation of policy utility and quantifies the policy utility dislocation, and provides new ways to launch policies that promote low-carbon lifestyles.
