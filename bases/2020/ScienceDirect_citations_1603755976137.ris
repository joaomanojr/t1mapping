AB  - Design concept evaluation in the early phase of product design plays a crucial role in new product development as it considerably determines the direction of subsequent design activities. However, it is a process involving uncertainty and subjectivity. The evaluation information mainly relies on expert’s subjective judgment, which is imprecise and uncertain. How to effectively and objectively evaluate the design concept under such subjective and uncertain environments remains an open question. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a fuzzy rough number-enhanced group decision-making framework for design concept evaluation by integrating a fuzzy rough number-based AHP (analytic hierarchy process) and a fuzzy rough number-based TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution). First of all, a fuzzy rough number is presented to aggregate personal risk assessment information and to manipulate the uncertainty and subjectivity during the decision-making. Then a fuzzy rough number-based AHP is developed to determine the criteria weights. A fuzzy rough number-based TOPSIS is proposed to conduct the alternative ranking. A practical case study is put forward to illustrate the applicability of the proposed decision-making framework. Experimental results and comparative studies demonstrate the superiority of the fuzzy rough number-based method in dealing with the uncertainty and subjectivity in design concept evaluation under group decision-making environment.

AB  - Building maintenance has been considered a crucial part of the life cycle of a building as the number of aged buildings is increasing globally. A number of maintenance-related problems are known to occur in aged buildings, particularly in urban areas. Thus, great importance should be given to maintenance as it preserves the original function of the buildings and maintains the quality of residents' lives. The degradation incurred by aging of the building can not only lead to excessive repair costs, but also affect its usability and resident safety negatively. Thus, such buildings need to be properly managed using a systematic approach. To this end, it is crucial to predict the maintenance cost for building management as the first step. This research developed a model adopting case-based reasoning and a genetic algorithm to predict the maintenance cost. An experiment was conducted to test the applicability of the model. The predicted maintenance cost was validated with 20 validation datasets. The results demonstrated that the retrieved cases had similarities of approximately 90% on average. The mean absolute error rate of the cost adapted by the Monte Carlo simulation was about 18%, which validated the model. This research contributes to knowledge of building maintenance by not only devising a systematic method for predicting the maintenance cost in advance, but also providing support to building managers’ decisions with regard to maintenance from a long-term perspective.

AB  - Agriculture in delta areas of emerging economies is highly reliant on the provision of water with adequate quality. This quality is often under pressure by season-related saltwater intrusion and poor domestic or industrial wastewater management. Methods to separate these two negative impacts on water quality for the delta areas are lacking but essential for proper management and supply of irrigation water. Therefore, the main aim of this research is to propose a method that maps salt and wastewater impacts on seasonal water quality and relate that to different land uses. Khulna, a delta city of Bangladesh was taken as a representative case study. Surface water samples have been collected from different city locations in winter, summer and monsoon seasons, and were analyzed for a variety of chemical-physical water quality parameters. Spatio-temporal variation maps were generated using Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method, and weighted overlay method was employed to map the current irrigation water use suitability based on FAO guidelines for the interpretations of water quality for irrigation. The influence of land-use on water quality was assessed by correlation analysis followed by bi-variate linear regression analysis. Analysis indicated significant (p < 0.05) seasonal dependent variation in water quality parameters, especially for saltwater influenced and generic water quality parameters. Also, the land-use percentage within 500 m radii to the sampling stations had a significant positive correlation with several parameters indicating saltwater and urban wastewater influences. Weighted overlay analysis revealed that during summer, approximately 1/3rd of the total studied area has a severe restriction for irrigation water use. The method presented here was shown to be effective in presenting variabilities on the effects of salinization and wastewater discharge on water quality in urbanized deltas and can be used as a knowledge base for formulating and implementing future urban infrastructure planning to improve irrigation water quality.

AB  - A challenge of planning real-life sustainable supplier selection and order allocation (SS/OA) problems for purchasing companies is to gather the extensive data and exact distributions of input data. Motivated by this challenge, this paper addresses imprecise probability distributions of uncertain per unit cost, CO2 emissions, demand, supply capacity and the minimum order quality and characterizes these distribution uncertainty by ambiguity sets including the true distributions. Moreover, the purchasing company decisions to be optimized simultaneously include four conflicting objectives regarding cost, CO2 emissions, society and suppliers’ comprehensive value while considering risk measures incurred by cost and CO2 emissions to achieve company sustainability. To help decision makers formulate practicable policy, a novel distributionally robust sustainable SS/OA goal programming model is developed with expected constraints and joint chance constraints. The proposed optimization model can balance multiple conflicting objectives, and effectively solve our sustainable SS/OA problem. More importantly, we structure ambiguous distributions sets, and thus derive the computationally tractable approximation form of the proposed practical model. Finally, we illustrate our optimization method through a case study about a steel company, conduct a thorough inquiry into the effect of uncertainty and summarize the management implications of the results.

KW  - Approximate dynamic programming
AB  - Sequential resource allocation decision-making for the military medical evacuation of wartime casualties consists of identifying which available aeromedical evacuation (MEDEVAC) assets to dispatch in response to each casualty event. These sequential decisions are complicated due to uncertainty in casualty demand (i.e., severity, number, and location) and service times. In this research, we present a Markov decision process model solved using a hierarchical aggregation value function approximation scheme within an approximate policy iteration algorithmic framework. The model seeks to optimize this sequential resource allocation decision under uncertainty of how to best dispatch MEDEVAC assets to calls for service. The policies determined via our approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach are compared to optimal military MEDEVAC dispatching policies for two small-scale problem instances and are compared to a closest-available MEDEVAC dispatching policy that is typically implemented in practice for a large-scale problem instance. Results indicate that our proposed approximation scheme provides high-quality, scalable dispatching policies that are more easily employed by military medical planners in the field. The identified ADP policies attain 99.8% and 99.5% optimal for the 6- and 12-zone problem instances investigated, as well as 9.6%, 9.2%, and 12.4% improvement over the closest-MEDEVAC policy for the 6-, 12-, and 34-zone problem instances investigated.

AB  - Circular business models formulate sustainable business strategies. To evaluate sustainable business strategies, it is necessary to be able to measure the actual performance of all processes of a supply chain in a circular business model. To measure the actual performance it is required to define what performance objectives are being pursued for all processes of a supply chain in a circular business model. There is a common understanding in literature that a supply chain in a circular business model differs from a supply chain in a linear business model. However, studies on what processes and what performance objectives conceptualize a supply chain in a circular business model are currently not available. A systematic literature review is conducted to conceptualize the processes and performance objectives of a supply chain in a circular business model. The study indicates that a supply chain in a circular business model consists of eight processes: (1) Plan (2) Source (3) Make (4) Deliver (5) Use (6) Return (7) Recover (8) Enable. Several processes need to be supplemented with subprocesses to enable planning of use and recovery, delivery of maintenance products and the return of end-of-use products. Furthermore, several processes need to shift their focus towards matching availability of resources (materials, water, energy) with the requirements of the supply chain, sourcing materials that minimize waste and enable returns and recovery after end-of-use, resource efficient production, sustainable packaging, waste disposal, buy-back and take back programs. The performance objectives can be classified into performance objectives for the circular economy, performance objectives that focus on the Triple Bottom Line and performance objectives that characterize a supply chain in a circular business model.

AB  - Well-being has a multidimensional nature as it depends on multifaceted factors such as material conditions and quality of life. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has developed the Better Life Index (BLI) as part of the OECD Better Life initiative to facilitate the better understanding of what drives well-being of people. The BLI is a three-level hierarchical composite indicator that covers several socio-economic aspects. In this paper, considering the entire hierarchical structure of the index, we introduce a bottom-up procedure for the aggregation of the components at each level. We formulate the assessment of BLI as a multiple objective programming (MOP) problem that facilitates the implementation of different concepts to derive different aggregation schemes. We incorporate the data from previous years into the normalization process of the indicators, to take into account the discrepancy on their observed values and smooth their deviations across the years. Also, we consider the public opinion about well-being that is captured from the worldwide responses in the web platform of OECD BLI. We incorporate the public opinion into the assessment models in the form of weight restrictions. In this way, we reduce the effect of compensation that might be imposed by the adopted modelling approach. We apply our methodology to the data of 38 countries (35 OECD and 3 non-OECD economies) for the year 2017. Our findings illustrate that the public opinion in the form of weight restrictions can effectively drive the optimization process and depict the collective preferences to the BLI scores.

AB  - To improve the coordination of blood supply and demand, the efficient design of the blood supply chain network (BSCN) is a proper strategy. In this regard, this paper is the first-ever study to strive for a simultaneous investigation on three interdependent challenges of the BSCN: (1) donors motivation, (2) optimizing location and capacity decisions, and (3) controlling the reliability and robustness of the network under combinatorial risk. As in reality, blood donors play a critical role in the BSC; this study undertakes motivational initiatives to encourage blood donors for maintaining sufficient blood supply. Advertisement, education and medical credits are the directions incorporated to construct the motivational function. To observe the efficiency as the most critical factor while evaluating the pool of location alternatives for establishing facilities, an augmented version of data envelopment analysis (DEA) is utilized. In addition, a mixed integer programming model is proposed by which the simultaneous location and capacity decisions are supported. The model is also extended to handle the combinatorial risk of uncertainty as well as disruption. Thus, a novel mixed possibilistic-stochastic flexible robust programming (MPSFRP) is developed. Eventually, the proposed model is implemented in a real case study to assess its practicality and then provide applicable insights for administrators.

AB  - For multi-objective optimization problems, obtaining a uniformly distributed approximation set is among the most important issues. During the past decades, various diversity mechanisms have been proposed to address this challenge. However, the existing diversity mechanisms tend to be problem-specific, and may not generalize well over different problem domains. Inspired by the idea of utilizing multiple low-level heuristics to achieve better diversity performance in multi-discipline problem solving, we focus on efficient algorithm design based on the methodology of selection hyper-heuristics. This study proposes a novel selection hyper-heuristic operating over multiple diversity mechanisms. The unique feature of the proposed approach lies in its ability to intelligently learn, select, and combine different diversity mechanisms with the purpose of taking advantages of them to obtain well-distributed approximation sets. Moreover, this work develops a new learning mechanism, the perturbation adaptive pursuit strategy, which is incorporated into the proposed hyper-heuristic to improve the decision-making process of selecting suitable diversity mechanisms for the problem at hand. The performance of the proposed hyper-heuristic is tested on 2-objective ZDT, 3-objective DTLZ, and 5-objective WFG test suites. Additionally, experiments are also conducted to investigate the ability of the novel hyper-heuristic to integrate existing multi-objective meta-heuristics on MaOP test suite from 3- to 10-objectives. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed selection hyper-heuristic for cross-domain capacity, particularly in producing well distributed approximation set with respect to Spacing metric and Hypervolume metric.

AB  - Traditionally business organizations take production and procurement decisions independently. First, the decision is made on product mix and then procurement plan is developed. However, procurement for all the dependent items is computed using bill of material information of independent items. Any market uncertainty in demand of independent items does not only affects production plan but also the procurement process. Also, sustainability is an essential business aspect and must be considered in production and procurement decisions. Hence, there is a need to develop a resilient integrated production and procurement model capable to capture the fluctuating market demand and also uncertainties in production, supplier & carrier capacities. The paper proposes an independent and integrated production and procurement model considering sustainability and uncertainty for a resilient supply chain. Various possible uncertainties such as market demand, machine capacity, supplier and carrier capacities in the presence of carbon emissions is also considered in the proposed models. The paper also proposed a supplier selection model under uncertainty using Fuzzy-MCDM techniques. The proposed models are MILP & MINLP, and are demonstrated using numerical illustrations solved in LINGO 10. The performance analysis is also conducted and it is found that the integrated model will always provide a more efficient optimal solution while traditional independent production & procurement models may even lead to infeasible solution.

AB  - Sustainable development is imperative for companies as society pressures for wealth environment are increasing. For this reason, all the decisions related with the design and planning of companies must include societal and environmental worries to achieve the desired sustainable development. Additionally, as market uncertainties are present, companies have to deal with financial risk associated with management decisions. This paper explores these challenges and proposes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the design and planning of supply chain that accounts for economic and environmental performances under risk assessment. An objective function incorporating environmental costs discounted from the economic revenues is developed where monetization of the environmental impacts is explored by applying the EPS method. Simultaneously, risk is considered by calculating the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measure. It is considered the maximization of the difference between the expected net present value and the environmental impact as well as the minimization of its risk associated. To solve the proposed model, it is applied the augmented ε-constraint method generating a pareto-optimal curve that provides the trade-offs between both objectives. As main contribution, this work provides a new model where monetization of environmental impacts is considered, and expands the traditional models based purely on economic risk to a new approach where financial risk contemplates both supply chain economic and environmental performances. A supply chain case-study is solved and based on the results managerial insights are derived.

AB  - This paper presents an assessment of 124 OECD banks during 2004–2013 in light of relevant accounting and financial indicators that reflect banking production process and performance. Novel DEA and SFA Dynamic Network Super-efficiency models are developed to handle the underlying relationships among major accounting and financial indicators. Additionally, we develop a novel super-efficiency concept for SFA to compare DEA and SFA on common grounds to the extent possible. Firstly, a relational model encompassing major profit sheet indicators, balance sheet indicators, and net income is presented under a dynamic network structure for both models under the non-parametric and parametric specifications. Subsequently, the dynamic effect of carry-over indicators is incorporated into them, so that efficiency scores can be properly computed for these three sub-structures. Differences in scores and ranks are explored by bootstrapped regressions. It reveals that results generated from the proposed models interact differently with the socio-economic and business-related variables.

AB  - Background
Health utilities express the perceptions patients have on the impact potential adverse events of medical treatments may have on their quality of life. Being able to accurately assess health utilities is crucial when deciding what is the best treatment when multiple and diverse treatment options exist, or when performing a cost / utility analysis. Due to the emotional and other complexities that may exist when such data are elicited, the values of the health utilities may be inaccurate and cause inconsistencies. Existing literature indicates that such inconsistencies may be very frequent. However, no method has been developed for dealing with such inconsistencies in an effective manner.
Methods
Given a set of health utilities, this paper first explores ways for determining if there are any inconsistencies in their values. It also proposes a number of quadratic optimization approaches to best estimate the actual (and hence unknown) values when a set of initial health utility values are provided by the patient and certain inconsistencies have been detected. This is achieved by readjusting the initial values in a way that is minimal and also satisfies certain consistency requirements.
Results
The proposed methods are applied on an illustrative example related to localized prostate cancer. Data from some published studies were used to illustrate how a set of initial values can be analyzed. This analysis aims at readjusting them in a minimal manner that would also satisfy some key numerical constraints pertinent to health utility values.
Conclusions
The numerical results and the computational complexities of the proposed models indicate that the proposed approaches are practical as they involve quadratic optimization modeling. These approaches are novel as the problem of addressing numerical inconsistencies in the elicitation process of health utilities has not been addressed adequately. The approaches are also critical in shared decision making and also when performing cost / utility analyses because health utilities play a central role in determining the quality-adjusted life years when making decisions in these healthcare domains.

AB  - The need to reduce the impact of building projects on the sustainability of the built environment and improve the use of resources necessitated several interventions such as the development of methods to assess building impacts and improve the sustainability performance of buildings. Using the BSAM scheme – a green building rating system developed specifically for the sub-Saharan region of Africa, the generalized Choquet fuzzy integral method was employed to determine the importance weights of the sustainability assessment criteria. Data collected from industry experts form the base inputs for the impact of the various sustainability criteria based on the local variations. Consequently, the building sustainability evaluation index and grading scheme were developed to measure and evaluate the sustainability performance of buildings. The developed sustainability rating model was validated in four real-world case studies to demonstrate its usefulness and robustness in practice. The findings revealed that the conventional approach of aggregation of points used by the existing green rating tools is less effective in dealing with criteria that have interactive characteristics. Also, assessment criteria such as sustainable construction practices, transportation, and energy have a significant impact on the sustainability of buildings. The study provides substantial contributions to the existing body of knowledge about green building assessment systems for built environment stakeholders, both from the theoretical and practical perspectives.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel type of soft set called basic uncertain information soft set (BUISS), which combines the notion of basic uncertain information and soft set theory. Since basic uncertain information can measure the quality of datum by using the degree of certainty, the developed BUISS provides a novel extension of soft set. In this paper, set operations and comparison law of basic uncertain information are also developed. Then, operations on BUISSs include set operations, ’AND’ operation and ’OR’ operation are defined. Besides, the Jaccard similarity between two BUISSs is introduced. The properties of the operations and similarity measure are studied. Theoretically, a multi-criteria group decision making (MAGDM) problem under basic uncertain information environment is analysed by using BUISSs. Two decision algorithms based on level BUISS and the aggregation of ϵ-approximate elements are proposed. Finally, an assessment of natural gas security in China is investigated to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the developed decision approaches.

AB  - The impact of collaborative research approaches on science and society has been subject to much debate and speculation. However, empirically grounded analyses of the process-impact link remain the exception. That includes comparing participation planning, intended processes, expectations and implementation. This paper delivers a theoretically informed comparison between different approaches to participation that are practised. It does so by performing a criteria-guided analysis of 31 participatory sustainability studies covering different areas of study and spatial levels. This provides an understanding of how participation is translated from theory into practice, what challenges occur that contradict initial aims, and how these potentially influence expected effects. The results show stark divergences between planning and implementation: persistent normative ideals in the planning phase, echoing deliberative and emancipatory claims, contrast with an emphasis on effectiveness during implementation. This leads to a systematic over-representation of experts and an under-representation of diverse societal actors in the studies. The focus is on producing directly measurable results rather than promoting possible (long-term) societal effects. These findings facilitate a deeper discussion of which conditions and procedures could aid the design and delivery of high-impact collaboration in the future.

AB  - Previous studies have suggested that building information modeling (BIM) and life-cycle assessments (LCAs) could be integrated to quantify and alleviate the environmental effects of buildings while simplifying and optimizing data acquisition. However, there has been no expert-based research into the true potential of BIM-based LCAs in a wider context with consideration of the advantages and disadvantages. This study aims to identify, classify, and prioritize these advantages and disadvantages using mixed methodological research and subject matter experts (SMEs). This includes a comprehensive literary review, semi-structured interviews with SMEs, and use of the Delphi method. A total of 21 advantages and 7 disadvantages associated with BIM-based LCAs were identified and classified. The advantages were grouped into four categories: decision making, material selection, sustainability performance, and waste reduction. The disadvantages were grouped into two categories: standardization and data processing. The Delphi method was applied via two rounds of questionnaires with ten SMEs to prioritize the advantages and disadvantages. The results of this study will provide practitioners and researchers with constructive information for the integrated use of BIM and LCAs and will create awareness in the architecture, engineering, and construction industry. The identified disadvantages show the requirements for future work and the priority rankings for both the advantages and disadvantages could be used by researchers and key stakeholders.

AB  - In this study, a land use suitability analysis was conducted for rural tourism in the Yenice district, located in the north-west of Turkey. As part of the research process involved dividing the area in question into landscape units using GIS and RS techniques. A suitability rating for tourism activities in each landscape unit was obtained by following through the steps of the ELECTRE method, individually repeated for each landscape unit. It is considered that the 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-degree suitable activities were most relevant in the rating of the nine different tourism activities. Therefore assessments were made on the basis of these first three ranks. As a result of the analysis, from the 1st-degree suitable activities identified, the first three were found to be mountaineering, trekking and wildlife observation. From the 2nd-degree suitable activities, the first three were flora observation, trekking and hiking, and from the 3rd-degree suitable activities, the first three trekking, orienteering and mountaineering.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a condition in which the body loses bone density and turns weak. Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) are potential, biocompatible and efficient nanocomposite system, which when combined with thermosensitive injectable sol-gel systems turn into an effective and efficient drug delivery system. The present study, aims to design and develop a thermogelling system incorporating SLN for improved local therapeutic effect. Alendronate Sodium (ALD) loaded SLN based in situ gels were developed for the treatment of osteoporosis and optimized by 32 full factorial design using Design expert®. SLNs was prepared and characterized with average particle size of 222 ± 4 nm, PDI of 0.252 ± 0.014, entrapment efficiency of 68.32 ± 1.64% and zeta potential of −32.2 ± 1.1 mV. ALD-SLN based in situ gels were assessed for gelation temperature, gelation time, viscosity, syringeability and in vitro release. The optimized ALD-SLN based in situ gel (SLN-PF-10) was found to be thermo-sensitive and exhibited drug release of 93.16% at 102 h. The in vivo studies carried out on wistar rats gelled rapidly at injection site; histopathological results proved the biocompatibility and biodegradability of the system. The obtained results suggest that ALD-SLN based in situ gel may be a promising drug delivery system over conventional dosage form for treating osteoporosis.

AB  - The D numbers methodology is a new mathematical approach that has been developed to improve some constraints surrounding evidence theory by managing information uncertainty and incompleteness. Various studies have been conducted on developing D numbers. One of the main extensions of the D numbers methodology is linguistic D numbers, which employs linguistic terms as a set of evaluations of D numbers. In this study, linguistic D numbers are further extended to an interval-valued belief structure. Additionally, to consider the various risk scenarios of each linguistic D number, a risk-based linguistic D numbers model is presented, based on proposed interval-valued linguistic D numbers. The efficiency of the proposed model is investigated by applying it to numerical examples and considering a case study. The results show the robustness of the risk-based linguistic D numbers methodology while simultaneously applying various risk scenarios.

AB  - In the past three years, many studies have been conducted on dockless bike sharing (DBS) around the world. However, these studies have focused minimally on the problem of damaged bicycles, which is critical to a DBS system’s operating efficiency, user satisfaction and platform sustainability. The objectives of this study are to develop an integrated theoreticalframework based on the normative activation model and examining the impact mechanism of users’ willingness to participate in repairing damaged bicycles. To achieve these objectives, a questionnaire survey was undertaken with a total of 633 DBS users from 27 provinces and municipalities in Mainland China. Empirical results confirm that the theoretical framework can provide a strong rationale for the investigation into DBS users’ willingness to participate in repairing damaged bicycles. Furthermore, internal psychological factors (i.e., personal norms, awareness of consequences, and perceived consumer effectiveness) and external intervention factors (i.e., platform incentives and service response efficiency) had positive effects on users’ participation willingness. Nevertheless, information publicity did not play a significantly direct role but indirectly affected the participation willingness through personal norms. Service response efficiency tended to moderate the impacts of personal norms and awareness of consequences on participation willingness. Eventually, some practical approaches to motivating users to participate in repairing damaged bicycles are proposed. This study extends the theory of normative activation model to better understand the behaviors of DBS users who participate in repairing damaged bicycles, and contributes significant theoretical and practical insights to the sustainability of DBS systems.

AB  - It has been established that design contributes to the occurrence of occupational injuries and illnesses in the construction sector. This has resulted in the need for designers to implement design for occupational safety and health (DfOSH), which is required by legislation in some countries. Consequently, designers (as individuals or organisations) should seek to mitigate occupational safety and health (OSH) risks through design. In order for design firms to do this effectively, they need to have the capability in respect of implementing DfOSH. However, there is a paucity of empirical studies on DfOSH capability as well as a robust mechanism for ascertaining the DfOSH capability of design firms. Drawing on the capability maturity concept combined with the application of expert group techniques, this study develops a novel web-based DfOSH capability maturity model that enables the assessment of the DfOSH capability of design organisations in the built environment. The model captures 18 DfOSH organisational capability attributes mapped onto five stages of capability maturation which are further contextualised by the incorporation of maturity level indicator examples in order to enable ease of use of the model. Results of the model evaluation confirm the model’s usefulness. Design firms could apply the model to self-assess their capability in order to understand the areas of capability deficiency and strength. Client organisations could also use the model as part of pre-qualification arrangements in selecting design firms with the needed DfOSH capability.

AB  - This paper develops a new prospect theory based method for heterogeneous multi-attribute group decision making with hybrid fuzzy truth degrees of alternative comparisons. The heterogeneous evaluations of attributes are expressed by intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs), trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFNs), intervals, real numbers and probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs), respectively. The fuzzy truth degrees contain five kinds of different forms: HFSs, IFSs, TrFNs, intervals and PLTSs. Firstly, based on prospect theory, the individual overall prospect value of alternative is defined considering the positive ideal solution (PIS) and negative ideal solution (NIS) simultaneously. Then, a multi-objective fuzzy program of maximizing all the importance of preference relations is built to determine the decision makers’ weights. The group consistency index (GCI) and group inconsistency index (GICI) are defined using the overall prospect values of alternatives. By minimizing GICI and maximizing GCI, a bi-objective hybrid fuzzy program is constructed to acquire the attribute weights, PIS, and NIS simultaneously. Employing the defuzzified technology, the bi-objective hybrid fuzzy program is converted into a single objective crisp program for resolution. Subsequently, the collective overall prospect values are computed to generate the collective ranking of alternatives. An example is analyzed to validate the proposed method.

AB  - Tactical Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) has emerged as an extension of the aggregate production planning, integrating mid-term decisions from procurement, production, distribution, and sales in a single plan. Despite the growing interest in the subject, past synthesizing research has focused more on the qualitative and procedural aspects of the topic rather than on modeling approaches to the problem. This paper conducts a review of the existing decision-making, i.e., optimization, models supporting S&OP. A holistic framework comprising the decisions involved in this planning activity is presented. The reviewed literature is arranged within the framework and grouped around different streams of literature which have been extending the aggregate production planning. Afterwards, the papers are classified according to the modeling approaches employed by past researchers. Finally, based on the characterization of the level of integration of different business functions provided by existing models, the review demonstrates that there are no synthesizing models characterizing the overall S&OP problem and that, even in the more comprehensive approaches, there is potential to include additional decisions that would be the basis for more sophisticated and proactive S&OP programs. We do expect this paper contributes to set the ground for more oriented and structured research in the field.

AB  - The entire nation of Bangladesh depends highly on on-road transportation than other alternative routes, and this sector plays an essential role in the country’s overall communication. In the present competitive scenario of any country, every sustainable development of infrastructure, especially in road services depends on effective management of the road user’s needs and expectation. Every service provider or concerned organisation need to understand and meet the road user’s requirement. To perceive the road user’s demand, the present study initiates a survey to key out the drivers of user satisfaction, estimate current satisfaction levels and capture the various issues that determine the future road service requirement of a newly constructed road in Rajshahi. The study primarily focuses on quantitative methods to represent the database. Formulating a mathematical model like Factor analysis and linear regression, the evaluation criteria are employed to identify the road user satisfaction level. The criteria’s weights have obtained through the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method for understanding the future road service requirement. A structured questionnaire with a sample of 250 and expert opinions have included for the data collection procedure. The stratified random sampling method has used in this research. Five complex variables namely Comfort, Safety, Amenities, Roadside Signage and Emergency services are considered to discover the overall satisfaction level in Rajshahi City Bypass Road. The study concluded with an exciting finding that road user comfort has a high impact on the whole satisfaction level, among other factors considered in this study. To evaluate the future needs and expectations of better road infrastructure development, Expert gives priority to the safety of road user. This study will assist the policymaker for future priority basis sustainable decision making, and the methodology adopted herein can be replicated globally.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel optimization algorithm called the Multi-Objective Volleyball Premier League (MOVPL) algorithm for solving global optimization problems with multiple objective functions. The algorithm is inspired by the teams competing in a volleyball premier league. The strong point of this study lies in extending the multi-objective version of the Volleyball Premier League algorithm (VPL), which is recently used in such scientific researches, with incorporating the well-known approaches including archive set and leader selection strategy to obtain optimal solutions for a given problem with multiple contradicted objectives. To analyze the performance of the algorithm, ten multi-objective benchmark problems with complex objectives are solved and compared with two well-known multi-objective algorithms, namely Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). Computational experiments highlight that the MOVPL outperforms the two state-of-the-art algorithms on multi-objective benchmark problems. In addition, the MOVPL algorithm has provided promising results on well-known engineering design optimization problems.

One hundred and one (101) depth sounding data were acquired using Schlumberger array, with half maximum current electrode separation (AB/2) of 100 m. The VES were quantitatively interpreted using partial curve matching and computer aided iteration to determine the geoelectrical parameters of each station. The remote sensing data were processed using the application of Geographic Information System-based multi-criteria technique ArcGIS software. Eight (8) parameters namely lineament density, drainage density, slope, transmissivity, hydraulic conductivity, coefficient of anisotropy, aquifer thickness and resistivity were used to produce the groundwater potential model while five (5) parameters namely, lineament density, slope, longitudinal conductance, hydraulic conductivity and thickness of layer overlying the delineated aquifer were also used to produce the vulnerability model. The final output of overlay parameters for estimating the groundwater potential gave an index that ranged from 1-5. The zone categorised as low groundwater potential covered about 80% of the area. The majority of the area falls within low (about 80%) vulnerability and low groundwater potential rating while being relatively protected from potential contaminants infiltrating from the surface. The prediction accuracy of the groundwater potential model was established via existing hand-dug well correlation analysis.

AB  - Most commonly, hydropower operation focused on the economic and social benefits of the humankind, whereas neglecting the riverine ecosystem conservation. This conventional approach of operation led to the degradation of the riverine ecosystem. As research progressed, adoption of natural flow variability in the operation of reservoir gained momentum. Flow variability is a major driver of the healthy river ecosystem, whereby discharging a certain amount of water could potentially reduce the adverse effect of reservoirs and dams on the riverine ecosystem. On this preface, the study presented here constitutes a multi-objective optimisation model of cascade reservoirs to maximise the power generation while minimising the shortage of environmental flows considering five environmental management classes. This paper analyses the case studies for Liujiaping-Yumitan cascade reservoirs. The environmental flows regarding each environmental management classes were calculated using “Global Environmental Flow Calculator”, the model was solved using an anon-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The NSGA-II helps to find Pareto optimal sets of solutions, NSGA-II, however, cannot be used solely for taking a comprehensive decision. Therefore, the Projection Pursuit Cluster (PPC) model has been used additionally for the optimal sequencing of the compromised optimal solutions. The maximum annual power production considering five environmental management classes were respectively: 1.121, 1.109, 1.103, 1.109, and 1.117 (x108 kWh) with environmental flows shortage of 2060.82, 616.497, 200.52, 28.88, and 0.004 (x104 m3) respectively. Findings resulted from this study, highlight the necessity for power production compromise for a better degree of environmental protection. In contrast, the environmental benefit is more important not only for the sustainable operation of the hydropower but also for fulfilling the universal needs of the riverine ecosystem. Therefore, the outcomes of this study can be a guideline for decision-makers to improve the comprehensive benefits of the Liujiaping-Yumitan cascade hydropower station along with the conservation of the environmental health of the river.

AB  - Recently, the multiple hydropower reservoirs operation optimization is attracting rising concerns from researchers and engineers since it can not only improve the utilization efficiency of water resource but also increase the generation benefit of hydropower enterprises. Mathematically, the reservoir operation problem is a typical multistage constrained optimization problem coupled with numerous decision variables and physical constraints. Sine cosine algorithm (SCA), a new swarm-based method, has the merits of clear principle and easy implementation but suffers from the premature convergence and falling into local optima. To improve the SCA performance, this paper proposes an adaptive sine cosine algorithm (ASCA) where the elite mutation strategy is used to increase the population diversity, the simplex dynamic search strategy is used to enhance the solution quality, while the neighborhood search strategy is used to improve the convergence rate. The simulations of 25 test functions show that ASCA outperforms several existing methods in both convergence rate and solution quality. The results of a real-world hydropower system in China demonstrate that ASCA betters the SCA method with obvious increase in power generation. Thus, the main contribution of this study is to provide an effective optimizer for multiple hydropower reservoirs operation.

AB  - Partner selection has been a vital factor for the success of collaboration in platform-based innovation ecosystems, but few studies examine how to select in such ecosystems. Based on three cases, this study proposes a conceptual framework of two-stage partner selection for platform-based innovation ecosystems toward servitization. The analysis shows that: the stage I is a preliminary selection and aims to form an open “Resource Pool”, based on individual candidate’s basic operation capability, platform compatibility and collaborative risk; the stage II is a combined selection of partners based on customers’ demands, focusing on candidates’ collaborative capability and sustainability capability. This study not only expands the scenario of partner selection in PIEs toward servitization but also appeals to how to select partners in PIEs, and it also offers guidance for manufacturing enterprises to implement the strategy of PIEs for servitization.

AB  - Improving the quality of education is one of the main objectives for governments, given that it plays an essential role in providing well-being to the population. In this regard, the efficiency of teachers may be a key issue to improve the students' academic performance and learning achievement. Specifically, in this paper, we analyse the efficiency of teachers from a multi-criteria optimization perspective. The purpose is to detect the most efficient teachers to gain knowledge about the characteristics of their teaching context, which contribute to increase the education performance of the students. To this aim, data from TIMSS and PIRLS 2011 for fourth-grade reading, mathematics and science teachers in Spain have been used. Three synthetic indexes gathering these data are calculated: a weak index allowing full compensation among the variables, a strong index informing about the worst variable value (no compensation scheme) and a synthetic index representing a different degree of compensation of the two formers. These indexes are built using aspiration and reservation levels for each variable. This allows us to include desirable ranges of values to be achieved by the variables in the study of the teachers' efficiency. With this, it is possible to know if the teachers are performing better, within or worse than the desired limits, and to rank the teachers according to their efficiency. The analysis carried out has contributed to have a better understanding of the policies to be followed in order to promote efficiency in teaching.

AB  - Managing project costs effectively, which comprises numerous aspects, is a highly complicated process for project managers that needs dependable cash knowledge in the entire life cycle of the project. Project managers’ proficiency and anticipating dependable cash flows lead to substantial improvements in project costs management. Moreover, healthy cash flow prognostication for the whole construction project gives project managers a real insight into the identification of problems, and its deficiency results in the failure of firms even with big profits to maintain themselves as well. Therefore, predicting reliable cash flow and monitoring the progress of projects in terms of cash are essential to be considered. Furthermore, due to the existence of uncertainties in projects, it is necessary to find it as a significant part of different approaches. Building upon these, an innovative approach is presented in this paper to prognosticate project cash flow based on both type-2 fuzzy extension of dependency structure matrix for project scheduling with overlapping activities and extended alternative queuing method under type-2 fuzzy environment to adopt the best scenario. Moreover, type-2 fuzzy numbers are applied to address the uncertainty of activities. Subsequently, a real case study of a gas field development project is employed to represent the efficiency of proposed approach. Ultimately, a comparative study is conducted to validate the results, and superiorities of the proposed approach are addressed from different aspects. The results illustrate that the presented approach is capable of handling real project problems and providing project managers with a suitable tool to comprehend the cash conditions of the projects.

AB  - Models are playing an increasingly prominent role in watershed management, and environmental management more generally. To successfully utilize model-based tools for governing water resources, modelling timelines must match decision making timelines, and modelling costs must fall within budget constraints. Clarity on management options for modelling processes, and effective strategies, are likey to improve outcomes. This paper provides a first conceptualisation of model management and lays out its scope. We define management of numerical models (MNM) as governance, operational support, and administration of modelling, and argue that it is a universal activity that is crucial but often overlooked in organizations that rely on modelling. The paper lays out the leverage points available to a model manager, based on a review of model management practices in several fields, highlights lessons learned, and opportunities for further improvement as model management becomes a mainstream concern in both research and practice.

AB  - The energy supply sector is the largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. A good understanding of energy systems from existing research will provide multidimensional insights for appropriate actions against global warming. This study conducts a systematic review of the literature covering 1,184 articles on energy issues dealing with climate change mitigation. Using a novel hand-coding typology analysis, we characterize the body of knowledge and identify possible research gaps according to the heterogeneity of the energy process, time scale, geographic location, energy technology, and concerned end-use sector. We find that research interest mainly focuses on the energy supply (496 papers) and the end-use process (359 papers). Energy storage and the energy–water–land nexus are two emerging areas. Biomass, solar, wind, and nuclear energy are the technologies that attract the most attention, while interest in hydrogen energy production and waste-to-energy has grown very recently. The cost-benefit and mitigation potential of renewable generation are the most studied topics, followed by the impacts of climate change on electricity production. In contrast, little attention is paid to research on traditional oil and gas exploration. Regarding the end-use sector, residents and transport are the most evident sectors studied. China, the United States, and Europe are the most featured regions while very few studies focus on Africa, South America, and Small Island Developing States. Current research topics concentrate on how to maximize the co-benefit of greenhouse gas mitigation and eco-environment protection via cost-benefit reinventions of energy systems. Discussions of technological innovation are grounded in optimal technology portfolio deployment and cost reduction potential, along with financial and political incentives.

AB  - Climate change represents a set of mechanisms that result in significant impacts toward hydrologic processes both at global and regional scales and usually they are developing countries where face the most challenging consequences. For instance, arid and semi-arid environments experience a high level of uncertainty in rainfall, which results in unforeseen periods of droughts, or high-intensity rainfall, which generates severe floods, increasing the water insecurity and flood damage in these areas. Climate pattern variations are specifically critical to forecast conditions for flood hazard management. General Circulation Models (GCMs) are useful tools to forecast future climate change scenarios. However, the application of GCM in flood hazard management is particularly challenging, given that they operate under high uncertainty and coarse scale. In this context, a five-class Flood Hazard Index (FHI) map was generated by using a multi criteria index approach, based on defining the greater influence of seven factors related to flood generation: runoff coefficient, elevation, slope, distance from the drainage network, rainfall intensity, soil erosion and land use. In this paper, we utilized monthly data for the baseline period (1980–2004), and then the output of 8 GCMs for surface air temperature (SAT) and precipitation were downscaled using a statistical model and evaluated in the baseline period. Consequently, the most suitable models were selected according to their average monthly performance. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was then used to develop a runoff coefficient map, using the downscaled outputs of the selected GCMs. Accordingly, a flood hazard model was developed at a large basin in the northeast of Iran for baseline and future periods (2040–2064) under RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. Having validated the generated flood map for the baseline period, the future maps were generated and compared. Results show the increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation; however, it was found that rainfall intensities are to be increased. This supports the final flood hazard map for the future climate conditions scenario with an increased relative hazard level. This was particularly observed in flat, and moderate sloped areas, compared to the model results with historic climate data.

AB  - The present research proposes an interactive optimization framework to aid tourists to organize their trip by generating personalized walking itineraries among several Points of Interest (POIs). The solution of the multi-objective Prize-Collecting Vehicle Routing Problem (MO-PCVRP) is used to simulate this tourist trip design problem. The objectives of the proposed formulation are the minimization of the total distance walked among selected POIs, the minimization of a fixed cost related to the number of the created itineraries, and the maximization of the total satisfaction gained by visiting the selected POIs. The optimization of the MO-PCVRP is conducted by the proposed Preference-Guided Firefly Algorithm (PGFA), which allows for preferences articulated by a decision-maker (DM) to guide the search. The PGFA is incorporated into an interactive framework, where a DM provides his/her preferential information, progressively during the optimization process, by ranking a small representative set of Pareto optimal solutions. The DM’s articulated preferences are elicited utilizing a preference disaggregation method, the UTASTAR, which results in a preference model, which is ultimately used to guide the search towards the DM’s Region of Interest (ROI) in the Pareto front. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed interactive PGFA framework are demonstrated over experimental scenarios.

The assessment, based on an analysis of the energy security and energy policies of Pakistan, focuses on the concepts of “Availability”, “Affordability”, “Technology”, “Governance”, and “Environment”. Twenty-two indicators, termed the Energy Security Indicators for Pakistan (ESIP), were selected. The ESIP were normalised using the z-score method and weighted based on principal component analysis (PCA). The index analysis revealed that Pakistan's energy security performance decreased between 1991 and 1999, followed by an increase until 2018. A maximum score of 8.36 was attained in 1991, and a minimum of 7.59 was achieved in 1999. During 2000–2018, the performance improved, resulting in a score of 8.29 in 2018. Supply, consumption, and import indicators played a key role in the energy security performance in the studied period.

AB  - Building design optimization plays an important role in maximizing the reliability, cost efficiency, and environmental sustainability of constructed facilities. As the construction of reinforced concrete (RC) structures consumed tremendous amounts of steel reinforcement and concrete, RC structural design optimization for minimal environmental impact has attracted increasing attentions from academics and industry in recent years. Nowadays, new information technologies and computing techniques were increasingly utilized for the sustainable design and optimization of RC structures to maximize energy efficiency, but it still lacks a critical review to summarize the common research themes and highlight the future needs in this field. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to critically review the previous research related to the computational design optimization of RC structures for the minimum environmental impact, with the aim of highlighting the present status and future trends for the advancement of building design optimization. First, the general introduction and background for importance of multidisciplinary detailed design optimization of RC structures are described. Thereafter, a critical review of available research objectives, structural components, optimization strategies, and the use of different computational tools in RC structural design optimization to integrate sustainability in constructional design stage, is provided in this paper. Furthermore, different research trends are analyzed and critically discussed in detail. Potential research directions to better quantify and evaluate the implementation of detailed RC structural design optimization are presented. This paper can assist structural design practitioners in academia and industry to introduce new horizons of sustainable construction by considering multiple aspects of detailed RC structural design and combining several computational tools with optimization strategies.

AB  - A Humanitarian supply chain deals with the delivery of supplies to the population of areas affected by natural disasters. One of the most important issues in Humanitarian Supply Chain Management (HSCM) is identifying and structuring different challenges and barriers in relief chains. This study is an attempt to provide a comprehensive framework for HSCM challenges in a case study of the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS). We identify HSCM challenges through literature review and expert opinions and use Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) to select the most important challenges. Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modeling (FISM) is then used to map the cause and effect relationships among various factors and develop a holistic picture of the main HSCM challenges. Finally, the overall framework of the HSCM challenges and the hierarchical model of the FISM are statistically verified using the Partial Least Square (PLS) method. We identify “managerial challenges” (at the category level), and “unfamiliarity of top managers with management knowledge” and “inappropriate division of labor” (at the sub-challenges level) as the root sub-challenges in this case study. Challenges not handled properly in pre-disaster stage will most likely occur more drastically in the post-disaster stage of the operations. The proposed model provides insightful guideline for increasing the effectiveness of relief efforts.

AB  - Considering the importance of virtual water in water management, the amount of virtual water was determined in the Shahid Rajae, Ramshir, and Hendijan irrigation and drainage networks. First, the water requirements of the crops were calculated using meteorological data of 10 years by CROPWAT software. Then, the virtual water of the networks was determined using crop yield. Also, the networks, according to the virtual water, were evaluated by questionnaire and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The results showed that the virtual water of wheat in the Shahid Rajae, Ramshir and Hendijan irrigation and drainage networks were 7183.33, 7148.88 and 7501.11 (m3/year), respectively. The amount of virtual water of barley in the mentioned networks was obtained at 8033.33, 8252.78 and 8705.56 (m3/year), respectively and for sesame in Shahid Rajae irrigation and drainage network was 9836.28 (m3/year) and in Ramshir the number was 10,252.31 (m3/year). Comparison between the amounts of calculating data and the delivered water indicated that in Shahid Rajae, Ramshir and Hendijan irrigation and drainage networks, a more water usage percentage, against the actual need, of 31, 23 and 28 was used. The results of AHP and the ranking of mentioned networks, using Super Decisions software with the virtual water approach, showed that field factors in Shahid Rajae and Hendijan networks and climate factors had the most significant weight in Ramshir network. The economic factors were the least influential among them. Comparing the results of AHP and the computation of virtual water revealed that the Hendijan network ranked first place. Qualitative assessment of the operation of network utilization based on virtual water and water productivity warned that the mentioned networks were in undesirable conditions.

AB  - This paper investigates the drivers, benefits and barriers of battery electric vehicle (BEV) development and an ongoing BEV transition in Iceland from a sociotechnical perspective. We focus on the following research questions: 1) What are the most promising driving forces behind BEV growth? 2) Why are BEVs restricted mostly to the niche level? 3) What are the possible opportunities for BEV future development? and 4) How viable are BEVs as a solution to harnessing low-carbon renewable sources in Iceland? The study uses original qualitative data comprising 29 research interviews involving experts from a wide range of sectors. The conceptual framework of multi-mode interaction, or “inter-niche competition”, is incorporated into the MLP to illustrate the interaction between BEVs and other technologies, in particular, plugin hybrid electric vehicles. We find that BEVs may take de-alignment and re-alignment pathway or reconfiguration pathway depending on the multi-technology interaction modes.

AB  - The approach of incorporating social responsibility (SR) practices into the supply chain network is gradually becoming a popular business strategy in developing countries. SR covers a broad spectrum of issues which includes working conditions, preventing corruption, human rights etc. That must be considered in a business context. Developing countries are becoming more aware but to cover the comprehensive spectrum of SR will take time, especially the adoption of SR practices into supply chains. Nowadays, ready-made garments companies of developing countries have to consider SR practices due to pressure from governments and stakeholders. Many of these companies are responsible for a large contribution to the economic growth of the country and thus, need a SR based sustainable business environment to gain a competitive advantage. Due to the lack of practices in SR based sourcing into an existing supply chain (SC), this sector demands an evaluation of the drivers to SR practices. Therefore, the unique contribution of this research is to evaluate sustainable drivers for implementation of SR based sourcing of ready-made garments SC in the context of a developing country - Bangladesh. To achieve the objectives, Delphi based fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods are employed. An analysis shows that finance is the key driver, composed of four important sub-sets; these are sustainable economic benefits, maximization of the net return on investment, business ethics and an enhanced reputation in the global market. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to check the stability of the results. The findings of the study will help industry managers in a proper adoption of SR practices in ready-made garments SC.

KW  - Fuzzy risk priority number (FRPN)
KW  - Dempster-shafer theory (DST)
AB  - Failure mode effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) is widely used, by developing a Risk Priority Number (RPN), to identify the failure modes and to prioritize them. But this has been extensively criticized due to several drawbacks in the literature. This issue can be solved partly by using Fuzzy FMECA (FFMECA) although Fuzzy logic itself has been criticized of having a direct bearing on subjectivity. This paper makes use of Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence-a proper mathematical framework to deal with the epistemic uncertainty often affecting the input evaluations of risk parameters. DST based FMECA is capable of providing an appropriate, precise and fault-free, failure mode prioritization. Belief and Plausibility distributions are used to synthesize the obtainable information and to make them useful for the purpose. The results obtained from DST-FMECA is compared to the results drawn from the FFMECA applications (already conducted in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage facility) to validate FFMECA and vice versa. The comparative results presented in this paper establish the capabilities of both the approaches, especially in a complex system like the LNG storage and similar facilities where even a minor failure may lead to catastrophic effects.

AB  - There has been an increasing emphasis on environment management due to generation of toxic waste, scarcity of natural resources, etc. This has pushed manufacturing organizations to implement closed loop supply chain practices. In this paper, critical factors for the implementation of closed loop supply chain practices are identified and analyzed in the Indian automotive sector. Various key factors were identified from extant literature and subsequently validated from 28 industry experts. Further, cause and effect relationships among the factors are examined by applying Grey-Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique. The results indicate that ‘Governmental regulations and support’ (R–C = 1.14), ‘Increased customer awareness on environment protection’ (R–C = 0.65) and ‘Implementation of information technologies’ (R–C = 0.34) are the most important causal factors. The paper provides recommendations for policy makers, managers and practitioners on implementation of closed loop supply chain practices for environmental management. The future studies can explore the critical factors in other manufacturing industries such as electronics firms.

AB  - Sustainable supply chain innovation (SSCI) simultaneously creates value for social, environmental, and economic dimensions. It is a fact that innovation is very significant in achieving long-term sustainability in the supply chain. Literature analysis reveals that an in-depth investigation of SSCI implementation framework in developing nations is still limited. Hence, this research work investigates the sustainable supply chain innovation enablers (SSCIEs) to achieve sustainability in the supply chain using the Pythagorean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) framework. The proposed framework is applied to an Indian manufacturing industry for the adoption of SSCIEs in its supply chain. This research identifies a total of thirty-three SSCIEs through extensive literature review and consultation with the decision-making panel. The identified enablers are then ranked based on their relative importance weight. The results reveal that 'collaboration and engagement of a diverse group of stakeholders (suppliers, local people, customers, environmental specialists, NGOs)' is the most critical SSCIE to achieve sustainability in the supply chain, followed by 'develop R&D labs in relationships with marketing, production, universities, and government institutes'. Sensitivity analysis is also performed in this study to check the robustness in the ranking of SSCIEs. This research helps the managers/policy-makers of the Indian manufacturing industry to identify and understand the most significant SSCIEs to achieve sustainability in the supply chain. The ranking of SSCIEs assists the managers to systematically focus on the most significant SSCIE and work towards its successful adoption. This study implies that the successful adoption of SSCIEs enables simultaneous improvement in social, environmental, and economic dimensions for Indian manufacturing industries.

AB  - Evaluating patient satisfaction on medical services in terms of multiple aspects is critical for hospital management. To settle this problem, a criteria system for medical service evaluation is first structured through a survey on experts. The probabilistic linguistic representation model is used to portray the qualitative evaluations that are unquantifiable in nature or unable to be accurately measured. Then, the best-worst method is extended to the probabilistic linguistic context to determine the weights of criteria information. Afterwards, we propose a comprehensive method by combing the probabilistic linguistic best-worst method with the gained and lost dominance score method to measure both the collective and worst performances of alternatives. Finally, we investigate a practical case about managing patient satisfaction in the blood collection room of a Chinese hospital which undergoes a reformation. The results show that the patient satisfaction has greatly improved after the reformation.

KW  - Software engineering
AB  - [Context] Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have been adopted by the Software Engineering (SE) community for approximately 15 years to provide meaningful summaries of evidence on several topics. Many of these SLRs are now potentially outdated, and there are no systematic proposals on when to update SLRs in SE. [Objective] The goal of this paper is to provide recommendations on when to update SLRs in SE. [Method] We evaluated, using a three-step approach, a third-party decision framework (3PDF) employed in other fields, to decide whether SLRs need updating. First, we conducted a literature review of SLR updates in SE and contacted the authors to obtain their feedback relating to the usefulness of the 3PDF within the context of SLR updates in SE. Second, we used these authors’ feedback to see whether the framework needed any adaptation; none was suggested. Third, we applied the 3PDF to the SLR updates identified in our literature review. [Results] The 3PDF showed that 14 of the 20 SLRs did not need updating. This supports the use of a decision support mechanism (such as the 3PDF) to help the SE community decide when to update SLRs. [Conclusions] We put forward that the 3PDF should be adopted by the SE community to keep relevant evidence up to date and to avoid wasting effort with unnecessary updates.

KW  - Double-quantitative decision-theoretic rough sets
KW  - Concept approximations
KW  - Incremental learning
AB  - Double-quantitative decision-theoretic rough sets (Dq-DTRS) provide more comprehensive description methods for rough approximations of concepts, which lay foundations for the development of attribute reduction and rule extraction of rough sets. Existing researches on concept approximations of Dq-DTRS pay more attention to the equivalence class of each object in approximating a concept, and calculate concept approximations from the whole data set in a batch. This makes the calculation of approximations time consuming in dynamic data sets. In this paper, we first analyze the variations of equivalence classes, decision classes, conditional probability, internal grade and external grade in dynamic data sets while objects vary sequentially or simultaneously over time. Then we propose the updating mechanisms for the concept approximations of two types of Dq-DTRS models from incremental perspective in dynamic decision information systems with the sequential and batch variations of objects. Meanwhile, we design incremental sequential insertion, sequential deletion, batch insertion, batch deletion algorithms for two Dq-DTRS models. Finally, we present experimental comparisons showing the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed incremental approaches in calculating approximations and the stability of the incremental updating algorithms from the perspective of the runtime under different inserting and deleting ratios and parameter values.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are prone to post-emission transformation and degradation to yield transformed PAH products (TPPs) that are potentially more hazardous than parent PAHs. This review provides a comprehensive evaluation of the potential environmental processes of PAHs such as sorption, volatilisation, photo- and bio-transformation and degradation on road surfaces, a significant accumulation point of PAHs. The review primarily evaluates key influential factors, toxicity implications, PAHs and TPPs fate and viable options for mitigating environmental and human health impacts. Photolysis was identified as the most significant transformation and degradation process due to the light absorption capacity of most PAHs. Climate conditions, physicochemical properties of road dust (sorbent), PAHs and TPPs and the existence of heavy metals such as Fe (III) are notable underlying factors for photolysis. Available data points to the predominance of carbonyl TPPs than other products such as nitro and hydroxyl TPPs with decreasing concentration trend of 9-fluorenone > 9,10-anthraquinone > benzo[a]fluorenone on road surfaces. The review recommends conducting future investigations targeting the influential factors pertaining to the fate of road deposited PAHs and TPPs. Furthermore, development of cost and time effective modern analytical methods is needed to quantify PAHs and TPPs present in minute quantities of samples. The review also identified that the unavailability of toxicity equivalency factors (TEF) for the most critical TPPs can be addressed using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and bioassays simultaneously. The content of this review is significant to the future work of researchers across various fields including analytical and environmental chemistry, stormwater pollution and toxicology.

AB  - A number of published studies have demonstrated that the human habitability of the primary urban areas in the Middle East, especially a number of areas in Gulf Cooperation Council countries, will be affected by extreme heat waves and elevated wet-bulb temperatures by the end of the 21st century. This could lead to chaos and extensive socioeconomic loss caused by climate change-related disasters in the rapidly expanding urban areas of the Middle East. The main scope of this study is to review the key impacts of climate change in urban areas of the Middle East, the vulnerability of critical urban infrastructure and systems, and to develop climate change adaptation strategies to create more robust urban environments that are resilient to both gradual climate change-driven events and extreme events. By efficiently preparing for the imminent threats posed by climate change, social and economic stability can be preserved, enabling growth in a changing environment. Due to the vulnerability of Doha to both extremes of dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures, its status is highlighted in terms of a projected future climate.

AB  - This paper provides a comprehensive literature review of preliminary publications on green and sustainable public procurement from the year 2000 until now. The aim of the review is to organise, evaluate and identify patterns and clusters in published articles, providing an overview of the state of the art in green and sustainable public procurement. Classification of the data identified three overall themes: organisational aspects, individual behaviour and operational tools, which comprise nine sub-categories: three organisational, two behavioural and four operational. The review shows how awareness and knowledge of circular public procurement attributes, based on circular policy and strategy implementation, are essential to conduct circular public procurement. The procurer’s beliefs and values are of high relevance in a transformation towards circular public procurement, simply not going for the lowest price, but finding an optimum combination that includes risk, timeliness and cost for the public institution on a life-cycle basis. Eco-labels, standards, life cycle assessments and life cycle costing are core parts of the process. Outlining the present knowledge as a foundation for future research in circular public procurement process development, this paper holds implications for both academics and procurement practitioners.

AB  - The activity of scheduling the production plan with the aim of achieving an optimal criterion has been explored in literature for several manufacturing sectors, in particular when it comes to solving scheduling NP-complete problems. In Dairy Manufacturing, determining an optimum criterion for the scheduling process has numerous internal and external challenges due to the complexity of this environment. The initial stages in the Dairy process are characterised by a continuous manufacturing environment and specific operational issues are observable: interruptions for the accomplishment of Cleaning-In-Place (CIP); a short raw material lifespan which demands a fast processing rate; and the stochastic raw material supply variation. By highlighting these three aspects, a critical trade-off emerges: CIP cycle-times heavily reduce the processing capacity, whereas the raw material processed requires an increase in available capacity due to the impact of seasonality, perishability and stochastic deliveries. Therefore, the scheduling plan must be dynamically readapted based on the current inventory, volume and frequency supplied, CIP cycle-times, maximum equipment running hours and downstream capacities. The aim of this research is to develop an integrated approach for generating equipment schedules under supply uncertainty typically observed in the dairy sector where criteria of sustainability are effortlessly incorporated for an improved decision-making process. An efficient Multi-objective Algorithm (MOA) combining conflicting key performance metrics such as minimising Work-In-Process (WIP), maximising Service Level Agreement (SLA), Utilisation and Energy consumption is proposed. The novelty consists of the ability to dynamically select trade-off criteria and visualise the optimum production plan according to the conditions defined by the decision-maker. The appropriate schedules are presented in a Pareto Frontier graph highlighting the entire non-dominance region according to the volume and frequency supplied. Even though sustainability metrics are usually ignored during production plan definitions, namely when a weak correlation between both environmental and profitable criteria is identified, the results demonstrate improved performance when both sustainable approaches are well explored.

AB  - The subject bias in the assessment of maritime simulator training in education is unnerving. Researchers repeatedly point to the need for enunciated assessment criteria for human assessors to achieve more reliable performance evaluations. Moreover, the integration of inter-subjective opinions on how assessment tools are both developed and weighted could diminish individual biases. In the current paper, a study aimed to examine the reliability and validity of a proposed computer-aided performance assessment (CAPA) tool for maritime pilotage assessment is reported. The proposed assessment tool was developed using the Analytical Hierarchy Process and Bayesian Network, with the intention of standardising the calculation and weighting of the performance indicators. A between-subject experiment (n = 16) has been conducted to test the reliability and validity of the CAPA-tool compared to conventional assessment methods when evaluating a pre-defined simulated pilotage operation. The interrater reliability was fair. The absolute reliability for assessing the technical competencies was good for the CAPA-tool and unacceptable for the control condition. The absolute reliability for assessing teamwork was unacceptable for both conditions. Evidence of construct validity has not been found. The experiment demonstrated the potential for higher reliability in the performance assessment of maritime simulator training, especially for assessing technical competencies. In parallel, it also confirmed the lack of reliability associated with using conventional assessment methods, which should inspire further research and development of maritime simulator assessment methods. The proposed CAPA-tool can be applied in education and training of maritime navigation training using full-mission bridge simulators, particularly for assessing pilotage operations.

AB  - Access to immunization varies greatly across the world. In order to increase vaccine coverage, the required vaccines need to be able to reach the targeted population. However, in low- and middle-income countries, this often turns out to be a challenging task. This article provides a literature review on vaccine distribution chains in low- and middle-income countries and consists of two main parts. The first part elaborates on the characteristics and challenges inherent to such distribution chains. In order to obtain a complete overview, both quantitative and qualitative papers are included. In the second part, relevant operations research and operations management literature is structured according to seven classification criteria: decision level, methodology, part of the vaccine distribution chain modelled, uncertainties and characteristics covered, performance measures, real-life applicability, and countries and vaccines covered. Throughout these classifications, a comparison is made between the issues reported in practice and those investigated in the operations research and operations management literature. Based on this analysis, we identify trends and conclude that several gaps exist, providing a promising avenue for future research.

There exists a variety of road-based routing problems at all three strategic, tactical and operational planning levels. Examples include location routing problems, fleet management, vehicle routing and shortest path problems. To evaluate solution quality, multiple, usually conflicting objectives are considered. Aiming to provide practice-oriented decision support, multi-objective routing problems attract more and more attention in academic literature. This contribution offers a wide overview of which application-oriented multi-objective routing problems are treated and what kind of trade-off is investigated. Furthermore, the algorithmic approach is analyzed with regard to its fitness assignment strategy, i.e. how the multiple objectives are handled, and its search strategy to solve the problem. In order to structure the literature, we propose a classification in which every identified objective is sorted into a category and related to problem elements. Both problem-specific and general research gaps in multi-objective routing problems are identified and offer a starting point for future research. Lastly, fitness assignment strategies are extensively discussed and insights regarding their usage are given.

AB  - Internet finance is a new financial model that applies Internet technology to payment, capital borrowing, and lending and transaction processing. In order to study the internal risks, this paper uses the Internet finance risk elements as the network node to construct the complex network of Internet finance risk system. Different from the study of macroeconomic shocks and Finance institution data, this paper mainly adopts the perspective of a complex system to analyze the systematic risk of Internet finance. By dividing the entire financial system into Internet finance subnet, regulatory subnet, and traditional financial subnet, the paper discusses the relationship between contagion and contagion among different risk factors and concludes that risks are transmitted externally through the internal circulation of Internet finance, thus discovering potential hidden dangers of systemic risks. The results show that the nodes around the center of the whole system are the main objects of financial risk contagion in the Internet finance network. In addition, macro-prudential regulation plays a decisive role in the control of the Internet finance system and points out the reasons why the current regulatory measures are still limited. This paper summarizes a research model that is still in its infancy, hoping to open up new prospects and directions for us to understand the cascading behaviors of Internet finance risks.

AB  - This paper proposes a sequential three-way decision-making approach based on BWM (best-worst method) and MULTIMOORA for multiple levels of granularity to deal with the multi-attribute group decision-making problems under uncertainty. First, using BWM to preprocess the attribute indicators of the decision problem, the relationship between the criteria important for decision problem is determined. Then, according to the importance of the determined level of granularity, from rough to clear, three-way decisions are made in sequence at each level. In this way, we obtain a lattice based three-way decision-making process. Also, in the process at each granularity, we consider the costs of both the decision process and the decision result. Thus, this paper builds a multigranulation sequential three-way decisions model with cost-sensitive. Next, based on the above-mentioned model, we propose a decision procedure and an algorithm for multi-attribute group decision making. It is worth noting that according to the research goals of the decision problem, MULTIMOORA is used to sort the classified alternatives. And a ranking result of the decision problem is given. Finally, the effectiveness and validity of the proposed model is verified by a multi-attribute group decision problem. The problem is the case of emergency diagnosis and treatment after a highway accident. And put forward reasonable suggestions for further development direction.

AB  - Vulnerability assessment is an important step in developing adaptation strategies. For biogeographically vital and extremely heterogeneous regions like Himalaya, assessing vulnerability as an inherent characteristic becomes crucial. The present study assesses the inherent vulnerability (IV) for farming communities of Himachal Pradesh as a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity using social and ecological indicators, group-decision methods, and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools. Data for 13,877 villages in three different biogeographical zones (Lower Himalaya (LH), Middle Himalaya (MH), Trans-Himalaya Tibetan Plateau (THTP)) was collected from secondary sources. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) was applied to weigh the social and ecological indicators. Weighted indicators were finally aggregated to generate the final inherent vulnerability index (IVI). The IVI values for different biogeographical zones (LH 0.35 ± 0.13, MH 0.42 ± 0.14 and THTP 0.30 ± 0.17) reveal that geographical location of zones played a decisive role in distribution of IV. MH showed the highest vulnerability due to fragile inherent biophysical and socio-economic conditions. The findings of this study will aid in better resource management for farming communities to enhance the agriculture capabilities of vulnerable zones. The findings of this study also have inference for developing adaptation strategies for present stressors in the region.

AB  - The article presents a work on the assessment of urban bus stop infrastructure in Bhubaneswar, and identifies improvement needs for the same as per bus passengers’ requirement and satisfaction. The work proposes a rationally appealing assessment framework, which uses perceived information of the bus passengers on various infrastructural items collected in scales of their importance and satisfaction level. In wake of this assessment, a set of key-factors are first identified using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on the stated importance ratings on an array of items, and then those key-factors are ordered by using Relative to an Identified Distribution Integral Transformation (RIDIT) analysis on stated satisfaction rating of the same survey items. The assessment framework takes an attempt to exploit the strength of these two types of dataset, while preparing the policy framework for improvement. The ordering of key-factors is carried out for two types of bus commuter such as captive users and choice users. The work documents new evidences in terms of improvement requirement of bus stop infrastructure in any urban area of emerging economies like India.

AB  - Eco-efficiency has become a cornerstone for any company that seeks to improve their environmental and economic aspects. In this context, the joint use of Life Cycle Assessment and Data Envelopment Analysis, known as LCA + DEA methodology, is an emerging and growing line of research. LCA estimates the environmental impacts of the products or services, while DEA evaluates their efficiency, providing targets and benchmarks for the inefficient ones. In this way, both the environmental and economic aspects are considered in the eco-efficiency assessment. Since LCA + DEA methodology is a novel research line, a literature review is necessary to depict its full scope and to support researchers and practitioners. This manuscript presents the first comprehensive and structured literature review of the joint use of LCA and DEA for eco-efficiency assessment. We propose a taxonomy for the reviewed articles based on the theoretical and practical issues of LCA + DEA methodology and classify them accordingly. This classification allows recognizing and discussing the main findings, which offer some managerial implications for professionals who want to start employing this methodology. In addition, a procedure for selecting a suitable method is proposed and the main limitations and research opportunities are identified. Finally, this review could be a starting point and a guide for systematically building knowledge about the in the joint use of LCA and DEA for eco-efficiency assessment.

AB  - Carbon capture and utilization technologies can open up new synthesis routes with economic benefits. Recently, the inclusion of carbon dioxide in polyols was extended by copolymerizing double bond agents. This allows for subsequent chain-extension with diisocyanates to polyurethane rubbers. This paper assesses their economic viability. A preliminary techno-economic assessment based on extended block flow diagrams reveals substantial uncertainty in profitability indicators due to applying a short-cut capital expenditure estimation method. Consequently, a process design for the polyol production was carried out, enabling a refined TEA incorporating an equipment-cost-based approach. Positive net present values are reported for multiple [double bond agent]-[diisocyanate]-[benchmark] combinations. The net present value is most sensitive to the sales and propylene oxide prices. The choice of the double bond moiety has decisive effect; the choice of the diisocyanate has minor effect on the TEA. Finding a favorable market position remains the biggest challenge for CO2-containing synthetic polyurethane rubbers.

AB  - IEEE 802.15.4 is a well-known protocol for low power, low rate wireless personal area networks that determines the specifications for the physical layer and the media access control sub-layer. However, IEEE 802.15.4 suffers from several limitations that play a role in reducing its performance such as using a default maximum backoff (macMaxCsmaBackoffs) value for channel access. In terms of energy efficiency, complexity, delay, using a default macMaxCsmaBackoffs does not provide optimum performance in every channel condition. For this reason, we built an adaptive channel access model, ACAMRO that maximizes channel utilization via adjusting macMaxCsmaBackoffs according to channel conditions. ACAMRO provides higher throughput which yields up to a 120% performance gain compared to the default IEEE 802.15.4 setup. It provides an implementation requiring low memory space that is less than 20 kBytes. Measured results show that ACAMRO achieves significant throughput increase, and a low complexity solution for Internet of Things devices.

AB  - In three-way decision, the description on the risk attitude of decision-makers is a focus topic. In this paper, we propose a novel three-way decision model based on cumulative prospect theory. First, with the aid of a reference point, the value functions are utilized to describe different risk appetites of decision-makers towards gains and losses. Second, the weight functions incorporate the nonlinear transformation of the conditional probability. The cumulative decision weights are decided by taking into account the increasing order of value functions. Then, with value functions and weight functions, the new decision rules of the proposed model are deduced based on the principle of maximizing the cumulative prospect value rather than minimizing the cost. Further, we analyze and prove the existence and uniqueness of thresholds of our model. Then, the decision rules are simplified based on the conditional probability and numerical solutions of thresholds, and the algorithm for deriving three-way decision rules is constructed. Finally, an illustrative example and a series of relevant comparisons are presented to illustrate and validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our model.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to review the empirical research in green supply chain management (GSCM) and discuss its current status. The article provides an assessment of research methodologies of 216 empirical studies in GSCM, which are published during the period 2001–2019, according to the approach proposed by Flynn et al. (1990). The findings indicate that number of empirical papers in GSCM has increased at a faster rate over the last few years. However, there are several aspects of empirical research which have been still unexplored such as the use of actual data for analyzing the GSCM performance, use of longitudinal data and use of research designs other than survey. The sectors other than manufacturing and automotive are also still relatively unexplored. More focus is also needed on the collection of sample data from emerging economies. Finally, detailed frameworks need to be developed which can help firms to implement each of the GSCM practices. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to specifically review the empirical papers in GSCM. The paper provides future research directions for empirical work in GSCM.

AB  - Due to the continuous cost reduction and technological innovation, electronic products are easily accessible to individuals and become omnipresent in our day-to-day lives. For electronics manufacturing enterprises, the pressure to maintain a competitive edge and the urgency to implement sustainable development makes the optimal selection of green supplier a necessity during operations. Although some studies have given some methods for green supplier selection, the consensus problem has not been sufficiently studied in the existing methods. In order to solve this problem, we propose a group consensus decision making framework to help choosing the best green supplier for electronics manufacturing. Firstly, decision makers’ preferences between the alternatives considered with respect to each criterion are elicited by the paired comparison method, and expressed as probabilistic linguistic preference relations. Secondly, a new consistency measure is defined and a convergent algorithm is described to aid the consistency improvement process in a given probabilistic linguistic preference relation. The algorithm adopts a local revision strategy and can be easily interpreted. Further, for the consensus model, in each round of this dynamic and interactive model, the most incompatible expert is asked to revise his/her judgment according to judgment feedback mechanism. If the expert rejects the suggestion, his/her weight of importance will be decreased based on the weighting feedback mechanism. Finally, a case study of selecting green supplier is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed group consensus decision making framework.

AB  - Forest management is currently challenged by the need to address an increasing demand for a wide range of ecosystem services. Addressing this challenge requires landscape-level supply approaches that may bring together multiple interests and goals of forest actors. Characterizing these interests and the corresponding forest management context is thus a prerequisite for an effective landscape-level approach. In this manuscript we develop actor analysis to characterize a forest management context. We implement and test the analysis in Vale do Sousa, in North-Western Portugal. The analysis encompassed the identification of key actors and 40 interviews. Results show that the analysis provides a thorough diagnosis of the current forest management context in Vale do Sousa. The findings give a snapshot of the actors and factors – interests, influential actors, conflicts, problems and power resources – that frame forest decisions. Specifically, results show the keen interest of all groups on wood provisioning and on regulating wildfires. However, actors have also revealed a strong interest in water quality, soil erosion prevention, biodiversity, landscape aesthetics and environmental education. Thus, there is a significant interest in the diversification of the provision of ecosystem services. Almost half of the actors have identified the multifunctional forest as being the ideal forest management framework for Vale do Sousa. Findings thus evince the potential of a participatory approach to negotiate a consensual landscape-level solution that may integrate the different actors' interests and provide a wide range of ecosystem services. This may be facilitated by another finding from actor analysis. A regional Forest Owners Association was recognized as the most influential actor and may support the development and negotiation of multiple objective landscape-level forest ecosystem management plans. In summary, these results may contribute to a better understanding of the forest management context in Vale do Sousa and to supporting the effectiveness of forest management planning. They may contribute further to anticipate problems and conflicts and to develop with actors from Vale do Sousa participatory processes to address them.

AB  - Logistics centers are those areas where all the national and international logistics and transportation operations are managed and directed to various business operations. One of the essential elements of an urban development system is to identify the appropriate location for a logistics center. In practice, the issue of evaluating and selecting the most suitable geographical area for a logistics center is considered as a complex decision making problem that can be well formulated through analytical and mathematical models. An exhaustive review of literature indicates that no concrete study has still proposed any integrated evaluation approach for logistics center selection. Thus, this paper aims in developing a two-stage decision making model to find out the most preferred zone in the autonomous communities of Spain for establishment of logistics centers. In the first stage, the considered communities are compared based on five evaluation criteria using data envelopment analysis (DEA) to identify the efficient and inefficient alternatives. In the second stage, a model is designed to evaluate the performance of the efficient communities using rough full consistency (R-FUCOM) and combined compromise solution (R-CoCoSo) methods. The adopted model allows capturing the uncertainty and vagueness in the decision makers’ judgments as involved in the evaluation process with the use of rough set theory (RST). The R-FUCOM method is utilized to obtain the optimal weights of the criteria, while R-CoCoSo method is finally used to rank the efficient communities. In addition, sensitivity analyses are performed to validate the robustness of the derived results.

AB  - To make safe road crossing decisions, the pedestrians need to estimate the distance and speed of oncoming vehicles, in order to make conclusions about the available time gap they need for their road crossing. Since the speed represents combination of distance and time, we focused on pedestrians’ ability to estimate the speed of the oncoming vehicles accurately. The aim of this study was to find some characteristics important for the speed mis-estimation tendencies and its values. Seventy participants estimated speed 3920 times in total. Research included three experiments. One vehicle participated in the first experiment, while second and third experiments involved two vehicles, with various combinations of vehicle positions and speeds. Initially it was determined that the pedestrians had tendencies to speed underestimation rather than its overestimation and accurate estimation. When the participants estimated the speed of one vehicle, they were more inclined to underestimation of higher speeds (over 50 km/h). On the other hand, in the situations where the participants estimated the speed of two vehicles, they showed a serious tendency towards underestimation of lower speeds (under 50 km/h) which was completely opposite. The factors such as driving experience, age and gender were identified as statistically important in terms of speed underestimation value. We determined that an increase in task complexity, with introduction of a larger number of vehicles, resulted in more severe speed underestimation. Finally, we identified some of the most risky traffic situations in terms of speed underestimation tendencies showed by our participants.

AB  - Flash floods are one of the most severe natural disasters throughout the world, and are responsible for sizeable social and economic losses, as well as countless injuries and death. Risk assessment, which identifies areas susceptible to flooding, has been shown to be an effective tool for managing and mitigating flash floods. The study aims to introduce the methods to determine the weights of the risk indices, and identify the different risk clusters. In this regard, we proposed a methodology for comprehensively assessing flash flood risk in a GIS environment, by the improved analytic hierarchy process (IAHP) method, and an integration of iterative self-organizing data (ISODATA) analysis and maximum likelihood (ISO-Maximum) clustering algorithm. The weight for each risk index is determined by the IAHP, which integrates the subjective characteristics with objective attributes of the assessment data. Based on the data mining technology, the integration of ISO-Maximum clustering algorithm derives a more reasonable classification. The Guangdong Province of China was selected for testing the proposed method’s applicability, and we used a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve approach to validate the modeling of the flash-flood risk distribution. The validation against the historical flash flood data indicates a high reliability of this method for comprehensive flash flood risk assessment. In order to verify the proposed method’s superiority, in addition, the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and the weights-of-evidence (WE) methods are used for comparison with the IAHP and ISO-Maximum clustering algorithm method. Moreover, we analyzed and compared the regularity of flash floods in the rural and urban areas. This study not only provides a new approach for large-scale flash flood comprehensive risk assessment, but also assists researchers and local decision-makers in designing flash flood mitigation strategies.

AB  - Agriculture in rural Bihar needs to maintain its productivity while enhancing its biophysical sustainability. To sustainably intensify the predominant rice-wheat systems, alternative cropping patterns with short duration legumes, planted in the usually fallow summer season, were developed. The addition of the legume ensures near-permanent soil cover, breaks the cereal-cereal cycle, and aims to improve soil quality while yielding between 0.6 and 1.2 Mg ha-1 of protein-rich dry matter. On-station experiments previously demonstrated the agronomical feasibility of the alternative cropping patterns while this study addresses the implications of such field-level changes at farm-level for different types of smallholders. We used the model FarmDESIGN to 1) assess current farm performance, 2) explore options to rearrange cropping patterns and 3) assess the impact of cropping patterns with mung bean. We found diverse farm performances, indicating a heterogenous farming community. Re-arranging current cropping patterns gave all farms possibilities to save water, increase soil organic matter content and decrease nitrogen losses but showed trade-offs with operating profit. Higher resource endowed farms had most potential to favourably rearrange the farm and improve multiple performance indicators. Two out of the five farms assessed did not benefit from including the alternative cropping patterns. We conclude that the impact of innovations greatly depends on farm type and current farm features and performance, described by a farm typology.

AB  - Deeply decarbonizing electricity production will likely require low-carbon sources that meet energy demand throughout days, years, and decades. Renewable energy sources (RES) are possible low-carbon options, but the intermittency of RES can limit their potential as viable options. Energy storage can be a solution to this problem by storing excess power from RES and providing power to the load when output power of RES is insufficient. To date, some researchers have investigated the effect of energy storage on power system operations and their environmental impacts. However, the effects of battery thermal management (BTM) controller on the decarbonization of power grid are not sufficiently covered. Thus, this paper presents a comprehensive review on the benefits of thermal management control strategies for battery energy storage in the effort towards decarbonizing the power sector. In this regard, the impacts of BTM controller and optimized controller approaches in terms of cooling, heating, operation, insulation, and the pros and cons of each are reviewed and discussed. Additionally, the impact of batteries, BTM controller, and renewable energy integration towards grid decarbonization are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of various types of batteries concerning power density, normal temperature range, life-cycle, size, environmental impact, and toxic emission are also highlighted. This study also focuses on different issues and challenges related to the BTM as well as recommendations for future research. The review demonstrates that the existing BTM control techniques not only improve the batteries efficiency, but also reduce its environmental impacts. However, further enhancement of BTM control using optimization methods is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Besides, as the majority of current approaches are restricted to simulation analysis, experimental validation becomes necessary. In summary, this review will hopefully strengthen the efforts toward the development of clean power systems with less environmental impact toward grid decarbonization.

AB  - The shortage of student housing in Western Europe and the high demand for student population indicate the potential of the impetus for more sustainable and better quality accommodation. The residential building sector is one of the significant contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, yet appropriate criteria for the assessment of student housing do not exist. Decisions to evaluate student housing are still primarily based on rental cost or anecdotal evidence when assessing their performance and living quality. Multi-objective criteria are needed to assist with the selection of sustainable student housing for higher education institutions students. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to identify key performance indicators for assessing sustainable student housing, and to develop a simple tool for the selection and measurement of the sustainability of student housing. The overarching aim is to improve the quality and sustainability of student accommodation in Europe. The methodology is based on a mixed-method research approach comprising a literature review on rating systems, a survey questionnaire with 610 student respondents, and a ranking analysis acquired from the severity index calculation. A total of 44 key performance indicators were identified, and a simple interactive tool was developed and tested. The proposed tool is demonstrated using a case study with two students as the decision-makers. The tool provides a novel approach to assess student housing. This creates an opportunity for a pan European environmental policy and an increase in market competitiveness to attract European and overseas students.

AB  - This paper extends existing research on the dynamic behaviour of supply chains by including the influence of online reviews. We model an online supply chain which contains customers and one e-commerce retailer. By using simulation, we compare the dynamic performance in a supply chain for two scenarios, namely adopting online review systems and without adopting the systems. The supply chain dynamic performance is measured by bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification. The results demonstrate that online review systems increase both the bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification, and this impact can be moderated by product quality, unit mismatch cost, lead time, and customer volatility. We further explore how our model could be extended to include market competition, dual sourcing, online review manipulation, and product returns. As the increase in the bullwhip effect and inventory variance amplification can be associated with supply chain inefficiency, managers who are aware of such consequence induced by online review adoption can make better decisions in supply chain management.

AB  - Optimal scale selection and attribute reduction are two key issues related to knowledge discovery in multi-scale decision tables (MDTs). The former is mainly used to obtain optimal scale combinations by selecting a suitable scale for each attribute, while the latter attempts to obtain reducts of these optimal scale combinations (i.e., optimal scale reducts). However, a search for all optimal scale reducts of a given MDT may result in a combinatorial explosion and existing approaches typically incur excessive time consumption. In this paper, a novel scale combination is defined to perform optimal scale selection and attribute reduction synchronously. Accordingly, an effective approach integrating sequential three-way decision with simplified MDTs is proposed to search for all optimal scale reducts. The efficiency of searching can be significantly improved by reducing the number of consistency checks required for single-scale decision tables and accelerating each check. First, a sequential three-way decision model of the scale space is proposed to search for all optimal scale reducts. Based on the trisecting-and-acting concept and a multi-step strategy, a large number of non-optimal scale reducts can be progressively transferred from the boundary regions to the negative regions. Second, an extended stepwise optimal scale selection method is introduced to quickly search for a single optimal scale reduct in the boundary region. Finally, a simplified MDT is proposed to accelerate the consistency checks for single-scale decision tables. Accordingly, an optimal scale selection algorithm integrating sequential three-way decision with simplified MDTs is proposed to improve the efficiency of searching for all optimal scale reducts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce overall computational time.

AB  - Standard cost-effectiveness models compare incremental cost increases to incremental average gains in health, commonly expressed in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Our research generalizes earlier models in several ways. We introduce risk aversion in Quality of Life (QoL), which leads to “willingness-to-pay” thresholds that rise with illness severity, potentially by an order of magnitude. Unlike traditional CEA analyses, which discriminate against persons with disabilities, our analysis implies that the marginal value of improving QoL rises for disabled individuals. Our model can also value the uncertain benefits of medical interventions by employing well-established analytic methods from finance. Finally, we show that traditional QALYs no longer serve as a single index of health, when consumers are risk-averse. To address this problem, we derive a generalized single-index of health outcomes—the Generalized Risk-Adjusted QALY (GRA-QALY). Earlier models of CEA that abstract from risk-aversion nest as special cases of our more general model.
