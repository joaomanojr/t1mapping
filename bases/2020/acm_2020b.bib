abstract = {As cloud storage adopts a distributed architecture to store massive data, how to improve the reliability of the storage center has become the focus of researchers. HDFS, the distributed file system of Hadoop, uses a sequential recovery method to recover failed replicas when the node is down, which does not take into account the priority of the replicas and the load difference between each node, resulting in request blocking and system load imbalance. Aiming at this problem, we propose a replica recovery method based on access frequency and network environment awareness, use a priority-based recovery algorithm and multi-objective decision algorithm to guarantee the response speed and realize the cluster load balance. We set up a simulation environment for verification and compared the performance of our method with various algorithms in throughput and response time. The simulation results showed that our approach effectively solved the load imbalance problem on the premise of ensuring faster response time.},

abstract = {The growth of increasingly complex data now raises new challenges in the world of technology. Large volumes of data store a lot of knowledge that can help in the decision-making process. One way to find knowledge in big data is by the Association Rule. The association rule is a technique in data mining that can produce rules based on the frequency of items appearing from a transactional database. One thing that is critical in the association rule is the determination of the minimum support value used to determine which items will be included in the formation of rules. If the minimum support value that is set is too small, it causes too many items to be involved in establishing the rules. Conversely, if the minimum support is too large, the number of items involved in forming the rule is too small. The problem in determining the minimum support value greatly affects the accuracy of the resulting rule. In this paper, various methods will be discussed to determine the minimum value of support through study literature based on related research. In addition, it explains research opportunities that can be done in the future about the minimum value of support determination in the association rule.},

abstract = {In this article, we encompass an analysis of the recent advances in parallel genetic algorithms (PGAs). We have selected these algorithms because of the deep interest in many research fields for techniques that can face complex applications where running times and other computational resources are greedily consumed by present solvers, and PGAs act then as efficient procedures that fully use modern computational platforms at the same time that allow the resolution of cutting-edge open problems. We have faced this survey on PGAs with the aim of helping newcomers or busy researchers who want to have a wide vision on the field. Then, we discuss the most well-known models and their implementations from a recent (last six years) and useful point of view: We discuss on highly cited articles, keywords, the venues where they can be found, a very comprehensive (and new) taxonomy covering different research domains involved in PGAs, and a set of recent applications. We also introduce a new vision on open challenges and try to give hints that guide practitioners and specialized researchers. Our conclusion is that there are many advantages to using these techniques and lots of potential interactions to other evolutionary algorithms; as well, we contribute to creating a body of knowledge in PGAs by summarizing them in a structured way, so the reader can find this article useful for practical research, graduate teaching, and as a pedagogical guide to this exciting domain.},

abstract = {Many real-world decision problems are inherently multi-objective in nature and concern multiple actors, making multi-objective multi-agent systems a key domain to study. We argue that trade-offs between conflicting objective functions should be analysed on the basis of the utility that these trade-offs have for the users of a system. We develop a new taxonomy which classifies multi-objective multi-agent decision making settings, on the basis of the reward structures and utility functions. We analyse which solution concepts apply to the different settings in our taxonomy, which allows us to offer a structured view of the field and identify promising directions for future research.},

abstract = {A recent comparison of well-established multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) has helped better identify the current state-of-the-art by considering (i) parameter tuning through automatic configuration, (ii) a wide range of different setups, and (iii) various performance metrics. Here, we automatically devise MOEAs with verified state-of-the-art performance for multi- and many-objective continuous optimization. Our work is based on two main considerations. The first is that high-performing algorithms can be obtained from a configurable algorithmic framework in an automated way. The second is that multiple performance metrics may be required to guide this automatic design process. In the first part of this work, we extend our previously proposed algorithmic framework, increasing the number of MOEAs, underlying evolutionary algorithms, and search paradigms that it comprises. These components can be combined following a general MOEA template, and an automatic configuration method is used to instantiate high-performing MOEA designs that optimize a given performance metric and present state-of-the-art performance. In the second part, we propose a multiobjective formulation for the automatic MOEA design, which proves critical for the context of many-objective optimization due to the disagreement of established performance metrics. Our proposed formulation leads to an automatically designed MOEA that presents state-of-the-art performance according to a set of metrics, rather than a single one.},
