AB  - The last decade witnessed tremendous developments in social media and e-democracy technologies. A fundamental aspect in these paradigms is that the number of decision makers allowed to partake in a decision making event drastically increases. As a result Large Scale Decision Making (LSDM) has established itself as an emerging and rapidly developing research field, attracting comprehensive studies in the last decade. LSDM events are a complex class of decision making problems, in which multiple and highly diverse stakeholders are involved and the provided alternatives are assessed considering multiple criteria/attributes. Since some of the extant LSDM research was extended from group decision making scenarios, there is no established definition for a LSDM problem as of yet. We firstly propose a clear definition and characterization of LSDM events as a basis for characterizing this emerging family of decision frameworks. Secondly, a classification of LSDM literature is provided. Effectively solving an LSDM problem is usually a complex and challenging process, in which reaching a high consensus or accounting for the agreement or conflict relationships between participants becomes critical. Accordingly, we present a taxonomy and an overview of LSDM models, predicated on their key elements, i.e. the procedures and specific steps followed by the existing models: consensus measurement, subgroup clustering, behavior management, and consensus building mechanisms. Finally, we provide a discussion in which we identify research challenges and propose future research directions under a triple perspective: key LSDM methodologies, AI and data fusion for LSDM, and innovative applications. The potential rise of AI-based LSDM is particularly highlighted in the discussion provided.

AB  - Wire EDM is a non-traditional machining method which is widely used for machining of extremely hard material, and complex shapes which would not be possible using conventional machining methods. This method of machining is widely practised in mould, tool and die industries. In this process, there is no direct contact between the work piece material and wire electrode; therefore the hardness of work piece material is not a bounding factor for the machining process. In this process, removal of material to be done by producing a spark between the work piece material and the wire electrode. In the present work, the machining of AISI D2 die steel of 13 mm diameter was performed using a 0.25 mm dia wire electrode. The influence of various input process parameters (Ton, Toff, Ip, Tw) on the response characteristics (MRR, Ig, MT) was investigated by using Taguchi L9 orthogonal array. Signal to noise ratio and ANOVA will also employed in the study of response parameters.

AB  - One of the important issues in water transport and sewer systems is determining the flow resistance and roughness coefficient. An accurate estimation of the roughness coefficient is a substantial issue in the design and operation of hydraulic structures such as sewer pipes, the calculation of water depth and flow velocity, and the accurate characterization of energy losses. The current study, applies two kernel based approaches [Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)] to develop roughness coefficient models for sewer pipes. In the modeling process, two types of sewer bed conditions were considered: loose bed and rigid bed. In order to develop the models, different input combinations were considered under three scenarios (Scenario 1: based on hydraulic characteristics, Scenarios 2 and 3: based on hydraulic and sediment characteristics with and without considering sediment concentration as input). The results proved the capability of the kernel based approaches in prediction of the roughness coefficient and it was found that for prediction of this parameter in sewer pipes Scenario 3 performed better than Scenarios 1 and 2. Also, the sensitivity analysis results showed that Dgr (Dimensionless particle number) for a rigid bed and wb/y (ratio of deposited bed width, wb, to flow depth, y) for a loose bed had the most significant impact on the modeling process.

AB  - Industrial cloud robotics (ICR) integrates cloud computing with industrial robots (IRs). The capabilities of industrial robots can be encapsulated as cloud services and used for ubiquitous manufacturing. Currently, the digital models for process simulation, path simulation, etc. are encapsulated as cloud services. The digital models in the cloud may not reflect the real state of the physical robotic manufacturing systems due to inaccurate or delayed condition update and therefore result in inaccurate simulation and robotic control. Digital twin can be used to realize fine sensing control of the physical manufacturing systems by a combination of high-fidelity digital model and sensory data. In this paper, we propose a framework of digital twin-based industrial cloud robotics (DTICR) for industrial robotic control and its key methodologies. The DTICR is divided into physical IR, digital IR, robotic control services, and digital twin data. First, the robotic control capabilities are encapsulated as Robot Control as-a-Service (RCaaS) based on manufacturing features and feature-level robotic capability model. Then the available RCaaSs are ranked and parsed. After manufacturing process simulation with digital IR models, RCaaSs are mapped to physical robots for robotic control. The digital IR models are connected to the physical robots and updated by sensory data. A case is implemented to demonstrate the workflow of DTICR. The results show that DTICR is capable to synchronize and merge digital IRs and physical IRs effectively. The bidirectional interaction between digital IRs and physical IRs enables fine sensing control of IRs. The proposed DTICR is also flexible and extensible by using ontology models.

AB  - Supply chain gap analysis is a practical method for quantitatively measuring the gap between the current state and a desired/ideal state in a supply chain, and generating a list of corrective actions to eliminate this gap and reach a desired/ideal level in supply chain goals. We propose a novel multi-objective co-evolutionary approach for supply chain gap analysis by hybridizing two well-known algorithms of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) and multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). The proposed algorithm considers the best solution of NSGAII at each iteration and uses it as the initial population in MOPSO. We consider three objective functions, including the expected costs, the total time, and customer satisfaction. The house of quality and quality function deployment is used to transform customer requirements into product characteristics. We also use a response surface methodology with multi-objective decision making for tuning the parameters since metaheuristic methods are generally sensitive to input parameters. We finally generate several random problems with different scenarios to compare the performance of our hybrid approach with singular methods. Five performance measures (i.e., mean ideal distance, diversification metric, quality metric, data envelopment analysis, and hypervolume metric) are used for this comparison. The results show the hybrid approach proposed in this study outperforms singular NSGAII and MOPSO metaheuristics in most scenarios.

AB  - The construction of undersea tunnels is an extremely risky endeavor that is vulnerable to water seepage and gushing due to the high water pressure, complex geological conditions, and pore water trapped in unstable rocks. This risk can lead to the collapse of tunnels under construction and disastrous consequences of fatalities and injuries as well as project delays and financial losses. The current risk management practices for tunnel construction projects in China are static and rely on the subjective judgement of experts and practitioners and do not incorporate real-time monitoring data during the construction process at this time. This paper presents a new method and system to assess and manage the risks during the construction process by coupling the risk management system and the quality management system and integrating jobsite monitoring data, design data, and environmental data. In this new method and system, the risk factors are categorized into (hu)man, material, machine, method, and environment, or 4M1E, and are quantitatively measured. The Dempster-Shaffer (D-S) theory was adopted in this method to both fuse the 4M1E data and to compute the aggregate risk index. This new method and system was tested during the Xiamen Metro Line No. 3 project when a shield machine cutter accident occurred. The results show that, before the accident, the individual risk measures in all five dimensions (4M1E) and the aggregate risk index were extremely high, which clearly illustrated the feasibility and capability of the newly developed method and system.

AB  - Recent outbreaks of food contamination scandals in India have resulted in increased concerns amongst consumers about food safety. Further, to tackle such circumstances, conformation to quality has become a must in Agriculture Supply Chain (ASC). Agro-stakeholders have tried to accomplish this demand through the integration of technology in ASC. One such technology is blockchain, which is still in its infancy in terms of adoption in India. Fueled by this motivation, we aim to investigate the significant barriers for blockchain adoption in Indian ASC. The constructs are identified through a comprehensive literature search and opinion of domain experts from five agro-organizations, academia, and agro-stakeholders. Further identified construct is modeled using an integrated ISM-DEMATEL approach, which not only interrogates interrelationship amongst identified constructs but also evaluates the intensity of the relationship between them. The identified constructs are also clustered into a suitable group using Fuzzy-MICMAC. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is also performed to check the robustness of the proposed model. The results reveal that “lack of government regulation and lack of trust among agro-stakeholder to use blockchain” are significant adoption barriers of blockchain in Indian ASC. Moreover, the managerial implication about the results is also provided, which will be useful to government and related agencies to take suitable measures to overcome these obstacles for increasing the rate of blockchain adoption in Indian ASC.

AB  - Urban rail network safety is a critical sector of urban public safety. However, there is no uniform standard for the safety evaluation of the urban rail network. This paper presents a novel methodology by integrating a multilevel decision tree with a fuzzy analytical approach to enhance urban rail network safety. The proposed methodology overcomes serious limitations such as subjectivity in the data and independence of the variables in decision-making processes. The proposed methodology is applied to the risk evaluation of the selected Chongqing rail transit lines and the Expo Line. The risk analysis is considered using the field data collected from these transit lines. The applied case studies confirm the general applicability of the methodology and the multilevel decision tree network. The main risk factors identified for the Chongqing rail traffic system are the terrorist threat, emergency management, and aging infrastructure which need to be investigated as a priority to mitigate risk associated with these infrastructures.

AB  - Determining locations is important for researchers and policymakers involved in developing photovoltaic (PV) plants. Here, solar extended exergy accounting performance is proposed as a new systematic decision support framework for prioritizing PV sites from environmental, technical, financial, and social viewpoints. The space-time solar extended exergy accounting performance of a 500 kW grid-connected PV system is determined for different Iranian climates as an example to show how the proposed tool can enhance site selection for PV power systems. The simulations are carried out for all 12 months of the year using the actual climatic, technical, economic, environmental, and social databases. Results for January, April, July, and October, representing winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively, are discussed in detail. The outcomes of the proposed method are compared with those for total irradiance, solar irradiance exergy, power generation, and exergy efficiency. In addition, several space-time ‏maps are developed for facilitating comparison among PV installation priorities obtained using various criteria. The average monthly total irradiance and solar irradiance exergy in Iran respectively varies in the range 120–184 kWh/m2/month and 112–172 kW/m2/month, respectively. The average monthly power generation, exergy efficiency, and extended exergy accounting performance of the developed plant are respectively found to be in the range of 45.3–66.0 MWh/month, 13.6‒14.8%, and 9.46–10.5% for different Iranian climates. Overall, southeast, central, and northwest cities of Iran are shown to be promising candidates for solar PV power systems based on the extended exergy accounting approach. The outcomes show that the proposed tool can be much more helpful than conventional methods for ranking candidate locations for building PV plants. The proposed extended exergy accounting performance framework can be applied for other stand-alone and hybrid renewable energy systems for various environmental and climatic conditions.

AB  - Renewable energy sources development has become popular in recent times for their energy security, employment creation and containment of greenhouse gases emissions. However, the development of renewable energy in developing countries has remained stagnant despite plenteous renewable energy sources due to existential barriers. Herein, using Ghana's renewable energy policy target of 10% other renewables besides hydroelectricity in her total energy mix by 2020 as a case analysis, this study identified and ranked the barriers to renewable energy development. Overall, twenty-three barriers were finalised and categorised under six broad headings, including technical, economic and financial, social, political and regulatory, institutional, and geographical. Subsequently, the proposed Multi-Objective Optimisation based on Ratio Analysis (MULTIMOORA) integrated with the Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) method was applied to rank barriers and sub-barriers. The political and regulatory barriers ranked highest among the six categories, while corruption and nepotism emerged as the most critical hurdle within the sub-barriers. The findings suggest that specific renewable energy standards, grid connection quotas and simplification of certification procedures are required. A bottom-up approach to renewable energy policy formulation is preferable for inclusiveness and sustainability. Moreover, the paper has developed a framework for the assessment of how each barrier impedes renewable energy development.

AB  - Over recent years, the frequency and intensity of torrential rain and flooding events linked to climate change have been impacting on cities throughout the world. Adaptation to climate change must therefore be integrated into urban planning and coupled with sustainable urban development and conservation policies. To do so, a good understanding of the vulnerability of cities to these extreme events is necessary, lending special attention to the specifics of the different urban areas, such as historic city centres. In the present study, a vulnerability evaluation methodology is presented for cities against extreme rainfall and flooding, which follows a holistic and multi-stakeholder approach, integrating architectural, socio-economic, and cultural perspectives, that supports evidence-based decision-making for the sustainable development of the agents that intervene in the process. The MIVES method, based on a multiple criteria decision-analysis process and a CityGML-based data model are used for that purpose, with which a process for capturing, evaluating, and representing information in an objective, organized, and systematic way has been developed. These advantages are demonstrated through the application of that process to a case study in Donostia-San Sebastián (northern Spain), located on a river estuary in front of the sea, with a wide diversity of building styles.

AB  - Sustainable supply chain management has been a topic of high interest to scholars and practitioners over the last 30 years. Accordingly, many review papers have been published on this topic with various areas of focus. Nevertheless, the overall body of literature still lacks a systematic review that thoroughly explores sustainability-driven decisions in the agriculture sector. To fill this research gap, the present paper presents an extensive review of 247 quantitative studies on sustainable agricultural supply chains. Our review scope includes both crop-based and livestock sectors that are monitored by eco-social corporate initiatives or government sustainability-driven legislation. To do so, we employ a content analysis-based review method, which is well known as an effective means of conducting literature reviews in a transparent, systematic, and rule-governed way, to rigorously collect, filter, and classify the existing research context. We classify the collected materials based on different structural dimensions and related analytic categories, which are obtained from both deductive and inductive categorization techniques. More specifically, we thoroughly evaluate the review results from four research perspectives – agricultural planning, supply chain management, sustainability development, and modeling methodology – aiming at presenting an overview of quantitative research projects. We conclude this study with a detailed discussion on evolving and promising research streams along with future research directions, which could be used as a roadmap by future researchers.

AB  - Gully erosion threatens land sustainability. Gullies trigger considerable erosion, damaging agricultural land, infrastructure and urban areas; thus, predicting and modelling gully susceptibility is of utmost concern. In particular, such a model is urgently required in semiarid areas where soil loss from gullies is high. Three predictive models are evaluated to assess gully erosion susceptibility mapping (GESM) in Semnan Province, Iran. The index of entropy (IOE), frequency ratio (FR) and certainty factor (CF) models are combined with remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to predict gully erosion. The collation of data from geographic resources identified 287 gullies in the study area. These areas were then randomly divided into 2 groups for calibration (70% or 201 gullies) and validation (30% or 86 gullies). Pairwise linear dependency amongst geoenvironmental factors was also assessed. A total of 16 factors were screened for modelling. Four performance metrics, namely, true skill statistic (TSS), area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, seed cell area index (SCAI) and modified SCAI (mSCAI), were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy and robustness of each model using validation datasets. Bootstrapped replicates were considered in estimating the accuracy and robustness of each model by varying gully/no-gully samples. The IOE results indicated that elevation, lithology and slope angle promoted favourable conditions for gully erosion in the study area. The results showed that the IOE model performed better than the FR and CF models for all three validation datasets (AUROCmean = 0.874 and TSSmean = 0.855). This finding was also confirmed in terms of stability and robustness (RTSS = 0.024 and RAUROC = 0.023). The SCAI and mSCAI results showed that all the models exhibited acceptable accuracy, but IOE demonstrated superior performance. Accordingly, IOE was used as the reference model for the study area, indicating that 19.75% and 9.44% of the study area are included in the predicted high and very high susceptibility classes, respectively. Considering the accuracy of GESM, IOE is a reliable tool for decision-making, management and land use planning within the region.

We also design a novel algorithm to forecast decision making and provide a related example illustrating the new method.

AB  - We are living a change of paradigm regarding decision-making. On the one hand, there is a growing need to make decisions in group at both professional and personal levels, on the other hand, it is increasingly difficult for decision-makers to meet at the same place and at the same time. The Web-based Group Decision Support Systems intend to overcome this limitation, allowing decision-makers to contribute to the decision process anytime and anywhere. However, they have been defined inadequately which has been compromising its success. This work discusses the current Group Decision Support Systems limitations in terms of challenges and possible impediments for their acceptance by the organizations and propose a conceptual definition of a Web-based Group Decision Support System that intends to overcome the existing limitations and help them to affirm as a reliable and useful tool. In addition, some crucial topics are addressed, such as communication and perception, that are essential and sometimes forgotten in the support of dispersed decision-makers. We concluded that there are still some limitations, mostly in terms of models and applications, that prevent the design of higher quality systems.

AB  - Data tables provide the standard means of representation of qualitative or quantitative information about objects of interest. They also form a starting point for the task of information processing: an operation of passing from raw data or information to semantically processed knowledge. The fundamental issue here is the question about the meaning of data: What do entries in the data table actually tell us about objects? It entails another question: How should the meaning be further processed? The primary aim of the article is an attempt to answer these two questions. To this end we are going to employ conceptual scales from formal concept analysis, an important theory of data processing introduced by Rudolf Wille, and apply them to data tables so as to obtain multivalued information systems, which were introduced and developed within the conceptual framework of rough set theory by Zdzisław Pawlak and Ewa Orłowska. Our main idea is to regard multivalued information systems as the semantics or meaning of the original tables. This idea allows us to describe and combine classical rough set theory, dominance-based rough set approach, and formal concept analysis within the single framework of multivalued information systems, which is rich enough to cope with a number of semantical nuances that may occur during the process of data analysis.

AB  - Given the importance that two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models have attained in recent years, this paper presents a systematic review of the literature on the topic focusing on the banking industry. We discuss the two-stage terminology itself, which is not yet not consolidated. We also discuss the current state-of-the-art and present opportunities, as well as challenges, for future studies. We analyse 59 papers, divided them into ten classes that cover various perspectives of two stage DEA studies, such as the economic context, geographic region of the banking units, methodological characteristics, and type of the models, either internal or external. Additionally, we investigate several controversial points regarding two-stage DEA models, such as the variable selection approach, the technique used in the second stage, and the possible impact of non-discretionary variables on efficiency. Results of the literature review indicate the lack of a uniform or universal terminology for two-stage DEA models in the baking industry. Moreover, the main objective of most papers involves extending or improving DEA models. Radial models, with variable returns of scale, and the intermediation approach are the most frequent configurations. Finally, we identify seven gaps in the literature for both internal and external two-stage DEA models and two specific gaps to external ones. Each gap is discussed in depth in the text and can be considered opportunities for future studies.

AB  - Earthquake early warning (EEW) is a relatively new strategy for reducing disaster risk and increasing resilience to seismic hazard in urban settings. EEW systems provide real-time information about ongoing earthquakes, enabling individuals, communities, governments, businesses and others located at distance to take timely action to reduce the probability of harm or loss before the earthquake-induced ground shaking reaches them. Examples of potential losses mitigated by EEW systems include injuries and infrastructure downtime. These systems are currently operating in nine countries, and are being/have been tested for implementation in 13 more. This paper reviews state-of-the-art approaches to EEW around the world. We specifically focus on the various algorithms that have been developed for the rapid calculation of seismic-source parameters, ground shaking, and potential consequences in the wake of an event. We also discuss limitations of the existing applied methodologies, with a particular emphasis on the lack of engineering-related (i.e., risk and resilience) metrics currently used to support decision-making related to the triggering of alerts by various end users. Finally, we provide a number of suggestions for future end-user-orientated advances in the field of EEW. For example, we propose that next-generation EEW systems should incorporate engineering-based, application-specific models/tools for more effective risk communication. They should operate within robust probabilistic frameworks that explicitly quantify uncertainties at each stage of the analysis, for more informed stakeholder decision-making. These types of advancements in EEW systems would represent an important paradigm shift in current approaches to issuing early warnings for natural hazards.

AB  - Building retrofitting improves energy performance, however, its interventions affect occupants’ life qualities such as thermal comfort. Although various retrofit scenarios are available, determination of the most optimized sets of retrofit actions dealing with competing objectives of energy consumption and thermal comfort is still a time-consuming challenge. This paper presents a novel methodology for facilitating the optimization process and reducing the required number of calculations by combining the Parametric Sensitivity Analysis (PSA) into this optimization process. As a result of PSA, a minimum set of accurately defined input data will be used in the optimization calculations to achieve two objectives: provision of indoor thermal comfort while not increasing the environmental impacts such as Green House Gases emissions (GHG). The process which is conducted for a validated model with field measurements includes (1) preliminary energy performance assessment of the dwelling archetype (2) proposing retrofit measures (3) PSA for retrofit actions to determine the most efficient ones (4) multi-objective optimization. The PSA results are used to prioritise two main categories of retrofit actions. The more important category is entered to the optimization process to simultaneously minimise the GHG emissions and interior thermal discomfort. Results indicate that AL, EWI, AR, and RI are the most effective variables and EWI has the most significant impact on reducing energy consumption. On the other hand, the other four parameters of OS, TS, WR, and AL have less impact on energy performance. As such, combining PSA at the early stages of the optimization algorithm assist to facilitate the optimization process. The optimal scenarios of this pilot study provide a useful methodology for decision-makers to handle multi-objective retrofit projects while controlling the possible side effects.

AB  - When disasters happen, time is often very urgent. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is one of the most effective approaches to support disaster emergency management. CBR takes good use of historical case data, which is one of the typical data-driven decision-making methods. Among the steps of CBR, adaptation is the core. To improve the adaptation, a hybrid mutation operator is implemented, and a new differential evolution (DE) algorithm is developed. An adaptation method based on the proposed algorithm is put forward to achieve case adaptation in the CBR system. The comparison results have shown that the proposed algorithm is superior compared with the state-of-art algorithms. Then, experiments of CBR have revealed that the adaptation method can effectively generate appropriate solutions with the help of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - Future wireless systems are expected to provide a wide range of services to more and more users. Advanced scheduling strategies thus arise not only to perform efficient radio resource management, but also to provide fairness among the users. On the other hand, the users’ perceived quality, i.e., Quality of Experience (QoE), is becoming one of the main drivers within the schedulers design. In this context, this paper starts by providing a comprehension of what is QoE and an overview of the evolution of wireless scheduling techniques. Afterwards, a survey on the most recent QoE-based scheduling strategies for wireless systems is presented, highlighting the application/service of the different approaches reported in the literature, as well as the parameters that were taken into account for QoE optimization. Therefore, this paper aims at helping readers interested in learning the basic concepts of QoE-oriented wireless resources scheduling, as well as getting in touch with its current research frontier.

AB  - Supplier selection problem has gained extensive attention in the prior studies. However, research based on Fuzzy Multi-Attribute Decision Making (F-MADM) approach in ranking resilient suppliers in logistic 4.0 is still in its infancy. Traditional MADM approach fails to address the resilient supplier selection problem in logistic 4.0 primarily because of the large amount of data concerning some attributes that are quantitative, yet difficult to process while making decisions. Besides, some qualitative attributes prevalent in logistic 4.0 entail imprecise perceptual or judgmental decision relevant information, and are substantially different than those considered in traditional suppler selection problems. This study develops a Decision Support System (DSS) that will help the decision maker to incorporate and process such imprecise heterogeneous data in a unified framework to rank a set of resilient suppliers in the logistic 4.0 environment. The proposed framework induces a triangular fuzzy number from large-scale temporal data using probability-possibility consistency principle. Large number of non-temporal data presented graphically are computed by extracting granular information that are imprecise in nature. Fuzzy linguistic variables are used to map the qualitative attributes. Finally, fuzzy based TOPSIS method is adopted to generate the ranking score of alternative suppliers. These ranking scores are used as input in a Multi-Choice Goal Programming (MCGP) model to determine optimal order allocation for respective suppliers. Finally, a sensitivity analysis assesses how the Supplier's Cost versus Resilience Index (SCRI) changes when differential priorities are set for respective cost and resilience attributes.

AB  - There are many vague and uncertain data which affect the quality of demand forecasting and ordering decisions in the supply chain of auto spare parts. This is due to the fact that the demand is not a unique concept for all levels involved in the supply chain. The downstream level of supply chain considers its intended criteria for deciding whether to place an order to the upstream level or not. Therefore, it is very important for the upstream level to discover the main criteria that are considered at the downstream level when issuing orders. In this paper, we intend to study the number of sold cars and their mileages associated to the each of spare parts as most important criteria when retailers are going to send the new orders to the distributor. ABC analysis is done for new criteria including the demand value of spare part in comparison with increase in the total mileages of its relevant cars during the fixed period. Rough set theory helps us induce patterns and rules from uncertain information obtained by ABC analysis over the past periods. We use the extracted rules to forecast the demands of retailers in the future and then place an order based on periodic review approach. Implementation of proposed model in the one of Iranian distributors, shows the significant improvement in the key performance measures such as increasing in service level and reducing the average value and age of inventory.

To help designers evaluating the excessive number of possible design combinations they encounter, this paper explores the application of reinforced learning (RL) to develop a model that assist designers in their pursuit of the optimal design. The present research utilizes the Markov Decision Process (MDP) as an application of RL and multi-attribute utility to solve the problem of the objective assessment of the design. The paper also presents a case study that demonstrates the utilization of the developed model to optimize the design of a single-family house.

AB  - Energy storage system (ESS) has been expected to be a viable solution which can provide diverse benefits to different power system stakeholders, including generation side, transmission network (TN), distribution network (DN) and off-grid microgrid. Prudent ESS allocation in power grids determines satisfactory performance of ESS applications. Optimal sizing and placement of ESS are crucial for power quality improvement of DN and transmission system protection setting. To solve this issue, considerable researches have been done either in modelling or algorithms. However, various options and complex characteristics in different sub-systems make it difficult to appraise a specific method for an ESS application, while the existing reviews only focus on ESS applications in DN. This paper provides a critical one-stop handbook related to one hundred and four methods in six categories covering all kinds of networks and tailored applications. Meanwhile, a systematic methodology is presented with an extensive latest literature review, including ESS selection, evaluation criteria, modelling and solution methods. Particularly, different technical requirements and modelling methods of different sub-systems are outlined. Besides, pros and cons of optimization methods are thoroughly analysed and compared to reveal state-of-the-art studies. Finally, key points in optimal ESS sizing and placement are concluded along with recommendations for future research.

AB  - In practical applications, there generally exist incomplete hybrid data with heterogeneous and missing features. The complex structures and the fast update of incomplete hybrid data bring a series of challenges for decision making in dynamic data environments. Three-way decisions, as an important cognitive method for analyzing uncertain problems, have been extensively applied into various fields. However, the existing studies rarely focus on exploring three-way decisions with incomplete hybrid information. To tackle this issue, we propose a Three-Way Neighborhood Decision Model (TWNDM) based on the data-driven neighborhood relation in terms of two pseudo-distance functions only satisfying the reflexivity. Considering that the addition and deletion of objects will result in the variation of information granules and decision structures, this paper presents a matrix-based dynamic framework for updating three-way regions (positive, boundary and negative regions) in TWNDM. A novel relation matrix is first constructed by using a pair of values to replace single value in the classical relation matrix. Then, the matrix-based approach for computing the three-way regions is established in the light of the new relation matrix, the decision matrix and the related induced matrices. Moreover, the matrix-based incremental mechanisms and algorithms for the maintenance of the three-way regions are presented when adding and removing objects, respectively. The results of comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed incremental algorithms can improve the computational performance for maintaining three-way regions in TWNDM compared with the static algorithm.

AB  - Background
Scalability challenge in real time healthcare monitoring system relates to several issues. One of the insistent issues is the increasing in the number of patients. Increasing in the patients’ number causes long queue and increase the waiting time for the patients in their seeking for healthcare services. Thus, an ethical issue raises as the healthcare providers should provide fast services for all patients. Recent studies have proposed scalable models that are limited to (1) triaging remote patients for the optimal emergency level and (2) prioritizing remote patients with the highest triage level to receive immediate healthcare services. However, these studies have shown limitations, that is, (1) they have not addressed the waiting time for all patients with different triage levels in the same waiting queue; and (2) they have not considered Emergency Department EDs patients. Therefore, considering the remote patients with the treated patients in EDs in one healthcare system is a demand, to efficiently handle all the patients' requests and productively manage the medical resources.
Objective
This study aims to reduce the waiting time for the remote patients in telemedicine with considering treated patients in EDs. The study presents a scalable telemedicine model to improve the ability of real time healthcare monitoring system in accommodating the increasing number of patients with chronic heart disease by reducing their waiting time for healthcare services, prioritizing the patients who have the most emergency cases and provide all the patients by fast healthcare services. The proposed model called Triaging and Prioritizing Model “TPM”.
Method
The proposed model “TPM” considers triaging and prioritizing all patients (remote and EDs patients) as two sequential processes. The TPM was formulated to triage the patients based on hybrid algorithms which combine Evidence-Theory with Fuzzy Cluster Means (FCM) and then prioritize the patients based on dedicated computational algorithm. A simulation, on 580 chronic heart diseases patients, was implemented. The patients considered as they have different emergency levels based on four vital data acquisition tools: electrocardiogram sensor, blood pressure sensor, oxygen saturation sensor and a text input as non-sensory based acquisition tool.
Results
Computational results show the superiority of the proposed model (TPM) in accommodating large numbers of patients and reducing their waiting time for services compared with relevant benchmark studies. In 1,185 minutes, TPM managed the (580) patients’ requests. By contrast, the benchmark managed only 256 patients at the same amount of time. In addition to that, TPM shows improvements in terms of waiting time and services provisioning rates compared with benchmark methods.
Conclusion
All patients with the different emergency levels receive services with less waiting time compared with the relevant studies. The proposed model (TPM) model considers both of remote patients and treated patients in EDs efficiently. TPM improves response time for the medical services, reduces waiting time for all patients and consequently, saves more lives.

AB  - Nowadays, urban flooding is becoming a severe issue in most of the developing and developed countries. The growth of the urbanization rate is also increasing, and the United Nations (UN) projected that 68 % of the world’s population would live in urban areas by 2050. People tend to migrate from rural to urban areas, which expose them more vulnerable to urban floods. The flood-related damages and deaths are increasing every year globally. Using the Birmingham city, Alabama (AL), USA as the study area, the objective of this research is to assess potential damage risks due to flood exposure of buildings and population in an urban area. Different social and environmental factors influence urban floods in an urban area. This paper considered elevation, slope, flow accumulation, land-use, soil types, and distance from the river as significant influential factors to urban flooding. The flood risk model hence can be developed by using an integrated GIS and cartrographic approach, in which we assessed and assigned weights to these factors and formed a GIS risk assessment model, which shows the level of flood risks in the floodplain areas of Birmingham and quantifies and maps both commercial buildings, home buildings, and populations’ exposed to flooding risks. This study found that the Valley Creek area is the highest flood risk zone in Birmingham, and about 48.85 percent of Valley Creek’s floodplain area will face very high flood risk. The findings further reveal that total number of 5602 people are living in high and very high flood risk zones in Birmingham that approximates 44.04 % of the total population in this floodplain area. The physical vulnerability is also assessed, and findings suggest that the Valley Creek zone has the highest percentage of residential (i.e., 56.14 %) and commercial (i.e., 75.34 %) buildings located in very high flood risk areas. Our study providing a GIS risk assessment approach to locating and mapping the areas, buildings, and populations from the most to the least at risks with a fine spatical scale for urban flood risk management. The numbers of vulnerable buildings and populations within each risk category are quantified and their distributions are mapped. Therefore, revealing population’s and buildings’ risks and their geographic information, this flood risk assessment can help local governments and communities prepare better to take actions against future urban flood events in Birmingham, and this integrated GIS and cartographic analysis for fine flooding assessments can be applied to other urban areas for flood mitigation and risk management.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a secure k-skyband computation framework in distributed multi-party databases, in which we can compute multi-party k-skyband without disclosing attributes of each object in a party to other parties, which is essential in privacy-aware applications. Although several secure skyline computation algorithms have been proposed, all of the conventional methods require a large amount of communication and computationally expensive secure comparison. Due to the large computational and communication complexities, they are not suitable for comparing or querying over a significant number of encrypted objects, which are located in privacy-preserving distributed multi-party databases. In the proposed framework, we used a secure multi-party sorting method that uses a homomorphic encryption scheme in the semi-honest adversary model and then uses the sorting order of the objects’ attributes on each dimension for k-skyband computation. The detailed security analysis shows that the proposed framework can achieve secure multi-party k-skyband computation without leaking sensitive information to others. Besides that, the performance evaluations via extensive simulations also demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed framework.

AB  - In case of a nuclear accident, adequate protection of the public and the environment requires timely assessment of the short- and long-term radiological exposure. Measurements of the radiation dose and the radioactive contamination in the environment are essential for the optimization of radiation protection and the decision making process. In the early phase, however, such measurements are rarely available or sufficient.To compensate for the lack of monitoring data during nuclear emergencies, especially in the early phase of the emergency, mathematical models are frequently used to assess the temporal and spatial distribution of radioactive contamination. During the transition and recovery phase, models are typically used to optimise remediation strategies by assessing the cost-effectiveness of different countermeasures. A prerequisite of course is that these models are fit for purpose. Different models may be needed during different phases of the accident. In this paper, we discuss the role of radioecological models during a nuclear emergency, and give an outlook on the scientific challenges which need to be addressed to further improve our predictions of human and wildlife exposure.

AB  - Evaluating airport and airline services levels of quality can help to improve the services provided to passengers and tourists, and give them better travel choices. Transportation literature is rich of studies concerning the evaluation of public transport service quality, especially regarding road and rail services; however, in the last decades, also in the field of air transport, the measurement of service quality is becoming a relevant issue. Service quality evaluation in air transport sector seems to be more difficult as regards the other public transport modes. As an example, a relevant first issue concerns the diversity of the services offered by the airlines and the services provided by the companies managing the airports. In order to investigate on the measurement of air transport service quality, we propose this paper for treating some interesting aspects concerning this issue by exploring the literature review of the studies analyzing service quality from the passengers’ point of view, where their opinions are collected by the well-known Customer Satisfaction Surveys (CSS). To provide convenient information of a certain level of quality, we selected papers published within the last decade (2008-2018) on journals indexed on the best database (e.g. Scopus, Web of Science).

AB  - Despite being a major urban need to create sustainable and healthy living areas, waste management services are not always properly and equally offered to all inhabitants due to inappropriate resource management approaches, high volumes of urban waste and ignorant consumption habits. From this point, waste transfer stations are considered as helpful solutions to facilitate the waste management process in territories which have different type of settlements and population density. In this context, the main aim of this study is to determine the potential suitable locations for waste transfer stations, which is expected to prevent the disposal of approximately 104,196.3 kg of waste directly into the rural area within the study area, Eskişehir province. To fulfil the aim of the study, geographical information systems (GIS) technologies were utilized for the performance of comprehensive spatial analyses and weighted overlay of a wide range of different data layers. The results showed that 1.1% of the study area were appropriate for the establishment of waste transfer stations, and GIS, as spatial data analysis tool, makes significant contributions to the knowledge of sustainability in the study areas.

AB  - The urban sewer pipeline network is a vital urban infrastructure that is highly at risk of failure and its deterioration can be harmful to the environment and public health and safety. Therefore, for performing an effective rehabilitation program, it is needed to prioritize the sewer pipelines. In this paper, a novel risk assessment approach is proposed for prioritizing sewer pipelines based on a combination of Geospatial Information System (GIS) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)- Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). To do so, it calculates the Probability of Failure (PoF), along with the Consequence of Failure (CoF) for the sewer pipelines. Bayesian Network (BN) as the probabilistic method is used to calculate PoF. The main contribution of the study lies in using a combination of GIS, AHP, and DEA for quantitatively assessing the CoF, firstly, the criteria weights are determined by the AHP method through experts’ judgments. Then, GIS functionalities along with DEA, are used to calculate scores for the alternatives. Finally, the outputs of the AHP method are integrated with the outputs of the DEA method in order to calculate CoF. The proposed method is applied to a local sewer pipeline network as a real-world case study to assess its risk of failure. The results indicated that the sewer pipelines are in good condition in the study area and among 1605 sewer pipelines, only 48 of them (about 3 %) are in a critical situation that it is needed to perform rehabilitation program.

AB  - The economics of photovoltaic systems are closely associated with the geographical locations of the sites. To identify appropriate land for photovoltaic systems, previous studies have mainly used geographic-information-system-based solar energy models capable of estimating spatial and temporal availability of solar energy. The models often require handling large and computationally challenging datasets to cover vast areas. In this study, we proposed and assessed the concept of a two-stage approach that sequentially searches and prioritizes suitable sites of photovoltaic panels using low- and high-resolution maps to reduce computational burdens and increase estimation accuracy. Resolutions at raster-cell sizes of 30 × 30 m and 5 × 5 m were selected to study the South Korean national highway network. Selected candidate sites in the 10th-percentile for low- and high-resolution cases produced 1,097 and 721 clusters with calculated solar energy potentials of 19,510,115 and 4,186,935 MWh, respectively. Approximately 90% of the edge-based distances between two adjacent potential sites for photovoltaic panels from the low- and high-resolution maps were found to be within 240 m. This result shows that although the low-resolution maps may not provide precise locations for prospective solar photovoltaic sites, they may help to identify potentially suitable areas for further investigation.

AB  - Demand for energy sources depends on several factors such as population growth, urbanization, industrialization, and climate. Among fundamental energy sources, natural gas is characterized by storage limitations and take-or-pay contracts, which makes it especially critical to forecast the demand accurately for cost management policies. Suppliers of natural gas require take-or-pay contracts to ensure that consumers pay for any unused amount up front; and if the demand exceeds the agreed amount, they pay for over-use as well. Consumers with a demand above the eligible consumer limit are categorized as free consumers; and they have to specify their daily, monthly, and annual demand in these take-or-pay contracts. In residential areas, natural gas is used predominantly for heating, hence its consumption has a strong seasonality. In winter, the variability in the atmospheric temperature leads to fluctuations in the demand, while in summer, weekend effects dominate. In order to take these features into account, a demand forecasting model based on a modulated expansion in Fourier series, supplemented by deviations from comfortable temperatures, is used in this study to determine the threshold value for the onset of natural gas usage for heating purposes. The upper and lower bounds for consumption are obtained as a function of temperature only, after analyzing the details of the temperature-consumption relationship using historical data. Moreover, a temperature-based simulation methodology is proposed and simulation results that provide guidelines to manage the costs of storage under uncertainty are presented by suggesting the minimum storage capacity required and showing the distribution of the costs.

AB  - A crucial factor for successful educational results in computer-based educational systems and e-learning systems is the learner’s assessment. Assessment is more effective when it is tailored to each individual student’s learning needs and abilities. Therefore, a significant research challenge is to create tests that include exercises/questions/activities etc., which conform to each learner’s knowledge level and learning needs and abilities. This goal constitutes the need for creating adaptive tests. However, the area of adaptive e-assessment has not yet been explored sufficiently and thus there is scope for a lot of improvement. To this end, in this paper we present a novel solution for adaptive e-assessment. The novelty and significance lie in the blending of fuzzy logic and cognitive theories for further enhancing the personalization and adaptivity in e-assessment. Particularly, fuzzy sets are used to describe the knowledge level of students in a more realistic way. Furthermore, the cognitive theory of Revised Bloom Taxonomy is used to express the learning objectives that are required to be assessed through the created test. In addition, a fuzzy rule-based reasoner, which decides about the number and the difficulty level of the test items that have to be included into the created personalized test for each level of the Revised Bloom Taxonomy, is used. The fuzzy rules are applied to the fuzzy sets that describe the learners’ knowledge level. For the formation of the fuzzy sets and rules, the opinion of several tutors, holding experience in the educational process and instruction, was taken into consideration. The created adaptive test comprises distinct test items based on the individual learning needs of each student. The presented method has been used in two tutoring systems and has been fully evaluated. The evaluation results show great accuracy in the selection of test items for each individual student.

AB  - Currently, the generative adversarial network (GAN), with complex training processes in the physical machine (PM), has achieved great priority in image generation, audio conversion, image translation, etc. To improve the training efficiency of GAN, the edge computing paradigm is accepted as an alternative of the PMs to accommodate the training tasks, that is, the training tasks are migrated to the edge nodes (ENs) for hosting. However, it is still a key challenge to keep the overall network performance (i.e., load balance, transmission time) and privacy protection of training tasks at the same time. To address this challenge, a privacy-aware task offloading method, named POM, is developed accordingly in this paper. First, improving the strength pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2) is fully investigated to obtain the offloading strategies for collaboratively improving the training performance and privacy preservation. Then, the most balanced offloading strategy is acquired for training GAN. Eventually, systematic experiments indicate that POM achieves an optimal performance efficiently among the other representative benchmark methods.

Road traffic crashes are estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death globally for all age groups, the first among children and young people aged 5–29 years. These numbers highlight the urgency of the road safety issue for all governments and administrations. In their efforts to improve safety, road network managers can benefit from decision support tools able to assist them in monitoring and managing road safety interventions. This paper proposes a DEA-based decision support method to assist urban road safety management practitioners in identifying those roads where the needs to improve safety are the greatest. The method is applied to an Italian urban road network to define a hierarchy of hazardous road locations based on safety conditions. The social cost of accidents is used here for the first time as the only output indicator while the average number of conflict points at intersections and traffic flow are used as inputs. Both Constant Returns to Scale and Variable Returns to Scale DEA models, each oriented to input and output, are used. The comparison of the results makes it possible to identify the DEA model that seems best suited to be used as a decision support tool to advise urban road safety management by enabling a more careful definition of targeted priority lists of interventions.

AB  - Water erosion is one of the main factors of soil degradation, causing several environmental damages. The most severe stage of water erosion culminates in the emergence of gullies, which increases soil loss and sediment production. The Cerrado biome, a global diversity hotspot, has been affected by gullies in many regions of Brazil. This study investigates the use of Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) to detect large gullies from RapidEye and SRTM data in anthropized Brazilian Cerrado. For the first time, a two-sided 50% overlap criteria was used to assess gully segmentation by applying Segmentation Evaluation Index (SEI). The results were checked against manually digitized reference data. The results of gully mapping indicated a user's accuracy of 69.78% in area 1 and 90.24% in area 2; a producer's accuracy of 52.10% in area 1 and 55.42% in area 2. The model can be considered robust since it was possible to detect gullies and generate few false positives in a heterogeneous scene, even using medium resolution data. This approach has the potential of application on a regional scale and can provide valuable information for land use management.

AB  - Eurosystem macroprudential policies require shared action between national authorities and the European Central Bank (ECB). This has created the need for a common basis for macroprudential analysis and as result the Macroprudential Database (MPDB) was created by the ECB and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) in 2015 in order to support the central bank's functions and ESRB's needs. This paper examines a multivariate binary logit Early Warning Model (EWM) for systemic banking crises with the aim to evaluate the predictive validity of the risk indicators included in the MPDB, as well as further variables not employed in previous relevant studies. The main finding is that most of the risk indicators employed from MPDB are important for forecasting from 4 to 1 years before the onset of a systemic banking crisis. Specific banking variables that capture industry concentration, assets, funding, and liquidity, are more important, on average, than macroeconomic variables. Important financial stress indicators such as CLIFS and SovCISS and economic expectations are also significant. The model is robust to various specifications and has a better performance when post-crisis observations are not included.

AB  - Irrigation systems have in recent years attained a higher level of variety in as such that the selection and implementation of an irrigation system is based on the physical constraints of the site area thus giving way to a much more adequate irrigation efficiency. With due regards to the water crisis in Iran and subsequent drought conditions, the implementing of similar irrigation systems in different regional conditions lacks any justification. In the Izeh plain the use of surface irrigation systems with minimal efficiency is very common. In order to implement and operate modern irrigation systems and maximize water saving, the site selection of pressurized irrigation systems was evaluated through the fusing of AHP and GIS maps for a variety of pressurized irrigation systems followed by the selecting of the best irrigation system for each region. In the current study physical and socio-economic criteria were selected as the main criterion and were then classified into several sub-criterions.A Drip irrigation system, a Gun irrigation system, a center pivot irrigation system and a linear irrigation system were selected as the options utilized when using the AHP method. The Gun and center pivot irrigation systems had the least value as they were not suitable for mountainous area. Drip and linear irrigation systems were given a higher value and were suitable for implementation in most regions. After comparing different sub-criterion, the drip irrigation system was identified as being the most suitable pressurized irrigation system for the Izeh plain.

AB  - Cyber–physical–social systems can be organized as workflows that interconnect the resources in physical, cyber, and social worlds in real time. This integration of these worlds with various resource as services requires service composition approaches that can integrate essential components and share relevant information in these worlds. Although numerous service composition approaches have been proposed, there still exist many challenges in the representation of user preference of service composition in cyber–physical–social systems. In this paper, a service composition approach based on the cultural distance is proposed to improve the reliability and satisfaction. This approach employs the cultural distance to measure the user preference quantitatively in a simple mathematical form. The user preference degree and the user preference vector are defined to select the service from a global view and an accurate point separately. Then, a 0-1 mixed-integer programming algorithm is used to identify the most suitable services for composition. The experimental results based on two real-world datasets show that the proposed approach for representing the user preference quantitatively is more simple and effective than other approaches. In a word, the proposed approach yields satisfactory performance of service composition in CPSS with regard to the user preference and efficiency.

KW  - Rough-fuzzy data envelopment analysis
AB  - The rapid development and application of smart technologies have trigged manufacturers’ servitization towards a new paradigm − smart product service system (PSS). Accurate selection of design alternatives are significantly vital to successful development project of smart PSS. This study establishes a new criteria system considering the value symbiosis among stakeholders and the smart capabilities generated using smart technologies. Since the proposed criteria system incorporates two types of criteria: cost-based and benefit-based, data envelopment analysis (DEA) method is more suitable for alternatives evaluation over other methods by requiring less information, fitting multiple data scales and not needing criteria weights. However, the previously developed DEA methods rarely simultaneously consider the intrapersonal linguistic vagueness and interpersonal preference randomness inherently involved in the selection process, which may lead to inaccurate and distorted results. Therefore, this study proposes a novel rough-fuzzy DEA method to select the suitable smart PSS design alternatives, integrating the strength of fuzzy number in capturing intrapersonal uncertainty and the feasibility of rough number in perceiving the interpersonal uncertainty. Finally, the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through a case study of smart conditioner service system and its comparisons with other methods.

AB  - Combining intelligence elements with product–service systems (PSS) has become a significant requirement because of the recent increase in customers’ demands for smart products and services. In order to have a successful smart PSS that satisfies customers’ requirements, investigation and evaluation of the innovation value propositions (IVPs) became one of the critical necessities. The main advantage of adopting smart PSS is the ability to gather and process a large amount of information to help in decision making and development processes. This study proposes an integrated framework using DEMATEL and CRITIC methods based on the neutrosophic set. Due to the variant of the evaluation process and ambiguity in information, neutrosophic numbers can be used as an efficient expression to guarantee successful evaluation. By comparing the neutrosophic set with other approaches that deal with uncertainty and inconsistency of information, it is more powerful in handling uncertain judgments by considering the truth-membership function, falsity-membership function, and indeterminacy-membership function. Smart PSS can improve an overall quality in the healthcare sector extensively as many solution types, such as sensors, smart pills, and smart surgeries. An illustrative case of smart Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) sensors is demonstrated to examine the proposed framework.

AB  - Depending on the context, several factors may affect users’ choices. In this paper, the main focus refers to modeling users’ willingness to purchase a new/innovative technology. This is a crucial task in order to increase the attractiveness of strategies that may be employed to achieve sustainable transportation. In particular this paper aims to investigate the different attributes/determinants that may influence the decision on choosing an Electric Vehicle. As a matter of fact, psychological factors, may play a significant role which should be modeled. Indeed, it is widely recognized that traditional approaches used to interpret and model users’ choice behavior may lead to neglect the numerous non-quantitative factors that may affect users’ behaviors. In particular, the role of attitudes and perception towards EVs advantages/barriers were investigated through the specification of a Hybrid Choice Model where the utility function was specified in accordance with the consolidated Random utility modeling but an alternative approach, based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process, was adopted for attitudes and perceptions representation. The purposes of the paper rely on (i) the survey data collection, (ii) data analysis, (iii) purchase behavior modeling. In particular, the main contribution of the paper is in the preliminary investigation of the combination between HCM and AHP method.

AB  - Numerous efforts have been taken to exhibit scientific advancement in solar energy analysis. The current study attempts to demonstrate an approach for the solar resource variability analysis at a spatial scale in the southern states of India. This work utilized the satellite-derived modelled solar insolation datasets due to the global unavailability of in-situ meteorological data sets (especially solar radiation data). The visualization of solar insolation components including direct normal irradiance (DNI) and global horizontal irradiance (GHI) provided an opportunity to understand the energy configurations and it’s potential. An average DNI variation of 5.21 kWh/m2 and GHI variation of 5.72 kWh/m2 was observed. The ancillary analysis presented a detailed map for southern states of India at a grid resolution of 100 km x 100 km. Thereafter DNI and GHI distribution map for selected random points were estimated. The precise summary statistics stated that maximum and minimum values of DNI range from 3.72 kWh/m2 to 5.59 kWh/m2 with an average value of 5.18 kWh/m2 and likewise maximum and minimum values of GHI ranges from 4.91 kWh/m2 to 5.99 kWh/m2 with an average value of 5.71 kWh/m2. It was observed that the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have a better prospect for further applications. The obtained results provided datasets for further analysis to comprehend the spatial distribution at a regional or national level. These will be very much useful for better energy planning for sound decision making.

AB  - Cloud federation helps cloud providers to scale up by renting resources from other providers when the workload increased. Moreover, cloud providers with idle or underutilized resources can sell their resources to others and earn revenue inside a cloud federation. One of the most critical problems in the federated cloud environment is the management of resources and cloud providers. The game theory seems to be an excellent way to model cloud federation. This paper introduces a new model for resource management between cloud providers in a centralized federated cloud environment, based on the well known Cournot and Bertrand games. To resolve the problem of heterogeneous resources, a physical resource unit which has specific computational features and can be shared between cloud providers is introduced in this paper. Besides, by introducing a new revenue-sharing approach between providers, this paper increased the collaboration of different providers. This model is implemented by the federated Cloudsim tool, and experiments show that the Cournot model outperforms others in terms of overall benefit and responsiveness. In other words, Cournot model can respond to an acceptable number of requests while making more profit. Besides, the reviews show that the proposed model works better than other methods in terms of time.

AB  - Due to increasing in natural disasters in the recent years, the issue of distribution network resilience has become highly important. Microgrids with different types of distributed energy resources have the capabilities to improve distribution network resilience under extreme events. In this paper, we present a mixed-integer linear program to restore prioritized loads while satisfying topology and operational constraints. In the presented model, we study dynamic microgrid formation and optimal management of various smart grid technologies such as distributed generations, demand response programs, wind turbines and energy storage units. We also investigate the significant impact of renewable energy resources, loads and their uncertainty on distribution system resilience. In addition, we determine the required emergency budgets of operation to restore a distribution system from extreme events. We also intend to examine the effects of demand response programs on improving the distribution system performance in the recovery period. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the presented model on a modified IEEE 33-node test system and a real distribution system.

AB  - To improve the dynamic reliability analysis of complex structures like turbine blisk, moving extremum surrogate modeling strategy (MESMS) is proposed in respect of multi-physics coupling with various dynamics/uncertainties. In this strategy, extremum thought is adopted to handle the dynamic process of input parameters and output response, and the importance sampling (IS) method is utilized to extract efficient samples and improve the efficiency of dynamic reliability estimation, and moving least square (MLS) method is used to select good samples from training samples with local compact support region to establish a precise surrogate model. The dynamic reliability analysis of turbine blisk radial deformation with fluid-thermo-structural interaction is performed to validate the developed MESMS in approximate precision and simulation performance by comparing to other methods. As shown in this study, (i) the reliability degree of turbine blisk is 0.9975 when the allowable value of radial deformation is 2.6856 × 10−3 m subject to 3 sigma levels; (ii) the proposed MESMS processes high modeling accuracy and efficiency due to small error; (iii) the MESMS holds high simulation performance in efficiency and accuracy owing to outstanding computational consumption and simulation. These results demonstrate that the MESMS is effective and applicable in structural reliability estimation regarding dynamics and uncertainties. The efforts of this paper provide a useful insight for performing the reliability-based design optimization of complex structures besides turbine blisk.

AB  - We develop a sustainability performance measurement framework for supplier evaluation and selection, using the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method. Even though the literature is rife with studies that deal with the supplier selection problem, companies that actively pursue sustainability strategies may need to add metrics that show suppliers’ sustainability performance. Existing models for measuring sustainability performance are limited in that they either evaluate the environmental and social performance separately, do not consider the inter-relationships between metrics across the three dimensions of sustainability, or utilize metrics that are difficult to obtain and evaluate accurately. To overcome this deficiency, we use the ANP method, that takes into account the interrelations between quantifiable and easy to obtain sustainability-related evaluation metrics. First, through an extensive literature review and feedback from an experts’ panel, we select and classify salient sustainability performance metrics related to supplier evaluation. With data collected through an extensive survey amongst 144 supply chain professionals in the UK and France, we develop the interdependencies between several sustainability metrics and determine the most critical metrics by calculating their relative weights. Results show that the selected socio-economic metrics carry the most relatively important role in supplier selection. Based on the findings of the study, we discuss implications for theory and practice. The proposed evaluation system can provide details on observing sustainable supply chain performance. It can also help to get a clearer insight into sustainability with a well-established quantitative decision-making process so that business strategies can be developed with more concerns on supply chain sustainability.

In this paper, we mention limitations of various existing similarity measures and propose a novel dice similarity measure for IFSs. Proposed dice similarity measure is based on inner product and overcomes limitations of existing similarity measures. In order to show the suitability and applicability of proposed dice similarity measure, we implement it on various classification problems of pattern recognition and medical diagnosis. Experimental results show that this does not only overcome limitations of existing similarity measures but also outperforms in pattern recognition and medical diagnosis problems. In this paper, we also propose an algorithm for face recognition problem using proposed dice similarity measure. This algorithm is demonstrated by an example and performance is compared with few existing methods for face recognition problems.

Elasticities are then determined to evaluate the sensitivity of satisfaction based on service quality attributes. The survey was developed consistent with functional and technical quality and from existing airline service quality and satisfaction literature. Data were collected online using Amazon Mechanical Turk, resulting in 624 respondents. The results show that both technical and functional quality play a role in determining satisfaction with airlines, though passengers are more satisfied with functional quality than technical quality. Overall, a majority of airline passengers are indifferent; they are neither satisfied nor unsatisfied toward airline service quality. Additionally, this research introduced additional factors in the analysis that have not been previously researched laying the groundwork for future research.

AB  - National economy and growth rely heavily on electricity but rapid urbanization, expeditious industrialization and increased domestic use due to population growth are among the reasons for the severe energy crisis in developing countries. The extended demand-supply gaps, depleting reservoirs of fossil fuel, and the environmental hazards altogether ignite the need for wider adoption of renewable energy resources for electricity generation. A functional assessment of the engineering design for this transition is a prerequisite before proceeding to on-ground implementation due to its high impact on system sustainability. To this end, we propose an agent-based modeling and simulation framework for the rapid prototyping of wind power plants. The proposed approach abstracts active components of wind power plants using agents and implements their dynamic behavior through agent interactions. The proposed model helps in composing different model components, design valuation, and forecasting energy generation in a cost-effective and productive manner. The proposed model is demonstrated by conceptualizing the design of the Foundation Wind Energy plant, located at Sindh, Pakistan, and the development of its agent-based model. The obtained short-term and long-term electricity generation profiles are validated with the actual data. We further compared the forecasts with the time series analysis performed on the actual data, using five different time-series forecasting models. The proposed simulation model and time series analysis model fit well on the actual data with a root mean square deviation of approximately 9 MW. The proposed framework will assist the policymakers in estimating the extent of electrical energy produced at given conditions using the wind potential available at the corridors of any country. It will further aid in the realistic analysis of the future dynamics of electricity demand and supply, hence help in effective energy planning.

KW  - Ranking problems in transportation
KW  - stochastic MCDA

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present the methodology of solving complex multiple criteria problems with the presence of non-deterministic information. The author proposes a universal approach of ranking variants applied to solve decision problem in transportation. Since the nature of transportation process is stochastic, the evaluation criteria are expressed by non-deterministic values. Moreover, the preferential information is usually contradictory, with some level of uncertainty. As a result, the proposed methodology is composed of two phases, including: (1) the selection of the most suitable deterministic multiple criteria decision aiding (MCDA) method to decision problem and decision maker’s (DM’s) preferences expressed during the modelling process; (2) its application using non-deterministic information, i.e. transformation of non-deterministic information into deterministic values, computation of relations between variants resulting in many deterministic rankings, calculation of non-deterministic relations between variants, and construction of final ranking. The proposed methodology is verified on the exemplary decision problem in transportation. The application of the procedure increases the credibility of the final decision, giving an opportunity to use deterministic MCDA method in the stochastic transportation process.

AB  - Target threat assessment aims to rank targets threat based on their attributes and state information, which provide decision support for subsequent military decisions, e.g. weapon-target optimal assignment. Most existing threat assessment methods can only obtain ranking results, decision-makers usually need to subjectively choose priority targets to attack or interfere based on the preset threat level and ordering results, which does not meet the requirements of complex battlefield situation and uncertain information processing. A method is urgently needed, which can objectively produce threat classification results and automatically provide priority targets for combat. Therefore, we propose a novel target threat assessment method based on three-way decisions under intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute decision making environment. The core parts are the conditional probability of each target is estimated by intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS and the decision thresholds of each target are constructed by intuitionistic fuzzy evaluation values. The results of two numerical examples show that the proposed method can effectively deal with dynamic uncertain situation information, turn the traditional ranking results of two-way decisions to the objective classification results of three-way decisions and can flexibly reflect the acquisition of situation information by setting the risk avoidance coefficient.

AB  - Wireless devices have a plethora of technologies at their disposal to connect to the Internet and other services. Management and control of each technology are traditionally isolated, and coordination between technologies is nearly non-existent. This isolation leads to poor resource usage, which in turn reduces performance and service guarantees. To satisfy growing user demands, we need to leverage the different service guarantees offered by each technology. Additionally, we need to improve orchestration between technologies to increase performance and flexibility while offering a more extensive range of service guarantees and maximizing resource utilization across networks and users. In this work, we present the general challenges one encounters when managing heterogeneous wireless networks. We argue that the primary challenge is the heterogeneity itself, the number of different devices and technologies, the different service requirements, and the increasing complexity as a consequence. However, technology abstraction can overcome these challenges. We provide an overview of state of the art commercial and scientific solutions and show their strengths and weaknesses. Based on this, we discuss the current status and what future challenges still await to provide full seamless heterogeneous wireless network management.

AB  - Sun energy is widely utilized to power stand-alone photovoltaic systems (SAPV). However, the lack of long term hourly meteorological data and inaccurate methods result in obstacles in designing the SAPV system. Therefore, an optimal sizing methodology is necessary to guarantee satisfactory performance. In this study, a new mutation adaptive differential evolution (MADE) based on a multi-objective optimization algorithm is presented to optimize the configuration of the off-grid SAPV system. Three conflict objectives are normalized, weighted, and then aggregated by mono-objective function to optimally size the off-grid stand-alone PV system. The performance of the proposed SAPV system is analyzed based on three types of batteries which are lead-acid, AGM, and lithium-ion. The results show that the optimal configuration based on lead-acid has less fitness function (f), life cycle cost (LCC), levelized cost of energy (LCE), with a high level of loss of load probability (LLP), and their values are 0.0268, 54,896 USD, 1.58USD, and 0.19%, respectively. Moreover, the optimal numbers of the PV modules (in series and parallel) and lead-acid battery are 9, 28, and 42, respectively. Therefore, the SAPV system based on lead-acid battery can be very suitable for real-world applications.

AB  - In this paper, the effects of various parameters, especially three engineering parameters (twist, sweep, lean), on aerodynamic and structural performance of the fan blade were investigated. The change of blade geometry was realized by the free-form deformation (FFD) approach, which was more flexible than traditional parametric methods. A coupled iterative loop was used in a multi-objective optimization process considering two operating conditions. Not only the effect of a single parameter, but also the coupled effects of any two of them were studied. From the Design of Experiment (DoE) results, it was found that the twist and sweep have a relatively strong influence on aerodynamic performance compared with the lean. In addition, it's noteworthy that the effect of twist varied at different operating conditions. At a relatively low mass flow rate, an excessive twist caused a sudden drop in the total pressure ratio. Optimization results showed that the maximum blade stress was dominated by the twist, and a backward sweep at mid-span decreased the stress on the blade surface. The design of twist (DoT) and sweep (DoS) provided a significant improvement of total pressure ratio ranging from 5% to 15% approximately throughout the operating range. Although the peak efficiency was increased by about 1.3% for DoT, the strong tip leakage vortex caused a premature rotating instability compared with the baseline design.

AB  - Known as an unpredictable natural disaster, earthquake is one of the most devastating natural disasters that causes significant life losses and damages, every year. After an earthquake, quick and accurate buildings damage identification for rescuing can reduce the number of fatalities. In this regard, Remote Sensing (RS) technology is an efficient tool for rapid monitoring of damaged buildings. This paper proposes a novel method, titled segment-by-segment comparison (SBSC), to generate buildings damage map using multi-temporal satellite images. The proposed method begins by extracting image-objects from pre- and post-earthquake images and equalizing them through segmentation intersection. After the extraction of various textural and spectral descriptors on pre- and post-event images, their differences are used as an input feature vector in a classification algorithm. Also, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to find the optimum descriptors in the classification process. The accuracy of the proposed method was tested on two different datasets from different sensors. Comparing the damage maps obtained from the proposed method with the manually extracted damage map, above 92% of the buildings were correctly labelled in both datasets.

AB  - World population forecasted growth, ageing population, rising urbanization and congestion levels carry several challenges inside urban mobility systems. The digitalization megatrend is reshaping lives worldwide while at the same time “Usership” is thriving along collaborative consumption. “Mobility-as-a-Service” (“MaaS”) emerges as a potential mobility disruption, in this new mobility ecosystem. Inspired in Finland's “MaaS” ecosystem, this paper aims to propose a “Mobility as a Service Public Policy Framework” with a two-stage approach. First structuring the “MaaS” concept, looking for the core features, its relations, that leads to its reconceptualization and a topology proposal. Secondly, a public policy framework is proposed, considering the policy instruments, indicative group of stakeholders responsible and the different urban mobility management decision levels. The authors argue that is fundamental to understand the nature of decisions which are intimately connected with the Urban Mobility system, to design and implement a coherent and effective policy framework, where the policy tools chosen to materialize policy decisions regarding “MaaS” should first consider the identification of the founding pillars of the “MaaS” concept, guiding the process of policy design accordingly. If “MaaS” is considered a Mobility Management tool, it can constitute an opportunity to redefine public transport and its financing.

AB  - Converting thermal energy into mechanical work by means of Organic Rankine Cycle is a validated technology to exploit low-grade waste heat. The typical design process of Organic Rankine Cycle system, which commonly involves working fluid selection, cycle configuration selection, operating parameters optimization, and component selection and sizing, is time-consuming and highly dependent on engineer's experience. Thus, it is difficult to achieve the optimal design in most cases. In recent decades, artificial intelligence has been gradually introduced into the design of energy system to overcome above shortcomings. In order to clarify the research field of artificial intelligence technique in Organic Rankine Cycle design and guide artificial intelligence technique to assist Organic Rankine Cycle design better, this study presents a preliminary literature summary on recent progresses of artificial intelligence technique in organic Rankine cycle systems design. First, this study analyzes four main procedures which constitute a typical design process of Organic Rankine Cycle systems and finds that design problems encountered during design process can be divided into three categories: decision making, parameter optimization and parameter prediction. In the second section, a detailed literature review on each design procedures using artificial intelligence algorithms is presented. At last, the state of art in this field and the prospects for the future work are provided.

AB  - Blockchain is today one of the most interesting and debated research topics. Blockchain technology was implemented for the first time in the financial sector a few years ago. However, it is currently used in many other areas, such as: healthcare, smart cities, smart contracts, energy markets, government sector. The success of this technology mainly lies in the following properties: reliability, transparency, immutability. In this study, we collect and analyze the main contributions in the literature about the application of blockchain in the agricultural sector, focusing on food traceability issues. Considering the quick growth of this technology and the high number of published documents in recent months, there is a need to catalog the different methodologies, proposed by the various scholars. Our aim is to detect the current research trends and possible future challenges. In the agricultural context, the need for an adequate traceability system is motivated by several bad habits and problems, such as the wide use of pesticides and fertilizers in fruits and vegetables, which are extremely harmful for human health. Moreover, in the last few years, the consumers’ attention about the quality of agricultural products has considerably increased. The present study shows that the blockchain technology is still in its early stage. Although there are several proposals in the literature, still a limited number of applications have been put into use in the real context. From the point of view of scientific research, only some countries are investing in this technology: China and United States are among the most active, but Italy is also very involved in this phenomenon. Overall, the blockchain technology appears very promising, but still many efforts are needed to reach the maturation stage.

AB  - Adoption of sustainability has become extremely essential aspect over the last decade for the industries to sustain in the global market. However, the adoption of sustainability in supply chain is more concern for the manufacturing organisations. Constantly, changing market has insisted these organisations to revisit their supply chain activities in order to penetrate sustainability effectively through various practices such as lean, green, circular, and industry 4.0 etc. But, the lack of verified Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) frameworks has become a concern for the practitioners. Similarly, solutions required to overcome the SSCM adoption issues also need to be updated accordingly to changing business environments. So, the present study aims to develop a framework to overcome SSCM challenges through industry 4.0 and circular economy based solution measures. This study identifies a unique set of 28 SSCM challenges and 22 solution measures. Further, an automotive case organisation is used to test the applicability of the developed framework through hybrid Best Worst Method (BWM)- ELimination and Choice Expressing REality (ELECTRE) approach. The inputs for BWM-ELECTRE approach is obtained by constructing an expert panel within the case organisation. Initial inputs are taken for BWM comparisons to compute the weight of SSCM challenges; whereas, further a comparison of challenges and solution measures is also obtained for ELECTRE approach to compute the final ranking of the solution measures to overcome SSCM challenges. The case findings reveal that managerial and organisational challenges and economic challenges emerge as most critical to SSCM adoption. The present study outcomes will be beneficial for researchers working in SSCM industry 4.0 and circular economy domain; whereas, the practitioners can use the prioritised solution measures to formulate effective strategies to overcome SSCM adoption failures.

AB  - Modern computing resources provide scientists, engineers, and system design teams the ability to study phenomena, such as system behavior, in a virtual setting. Computational modeling and simulation (M&S) enables engineers to avoid many of the challenges encountered in traditional design engineering, including the design, manufacture, and testing of expensive prototypes prior to having an optimized design. However, the use of M&S carries its own challenges, such as the computational time and resources required to execute effective studies, and uncertainties arising from simplifying assumptions inherent to computer models, which are intended to be an approximate representation of reality. In recent year advances have been made in a number of areas related to the efficient and reliable use of M&S for system evaluations, including design & analysis of computer experiments, uncertainty quantification, probabilistic analysis, response optimization, and data synthesis techniques. In this review paper, a general framework for systematically executing efficient M&S studies at the component-level, product-level, system-level, and system-of-systems-level is described. A case study is used to demonstrate how statistical and probabilistic techniques can be integrated with M&S to address those challenges inherent to model-based engineering, and how this aligns with the proposed workflow. The example is a gun-launch dynamics model of an artillery projectile developed by US Army engineers, and illustrates the application of this workflow in the study of subsystem system reliability, performance, and end-to-end system-level characterization.

AB  - Flooding is the overflow of water from stream, river, lake and sea that occurs all over the world and has disastrous effects on human society and environment. Frequent severe flood event in eastern India cause of death and damages every year so, the development of flood susceptibility method is needed for identifying the flood vulnerability areas to reduce the damages. Techniques of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) can help to flood susceptibility modeling by the accrued and analyzing huge amount of data in short time. The main objectives of this study are to determine the effectiveness of Evidence Belief Function (EBF), binomial Logistic Regression (LR) and ensemble of EBF and LR (EBF-LR) model with RS and GIS techniques for flood susceptibility mapping and spatial prediction of flood-susceptible areas in the Koiya river basin of West Bengal, India. Eight flood conditioning factors; Land use and land cover (LULC), soil, rainfall, normalized differences vegetation index (NDVI), distance to river, elevation, topographic wetness index (TWI) and stream power index (SPI) have been used, and total 264 historical flooding points were mapped, and randomly divided in to training (70%) and validating (30%) dataset. Flood susceptibility map has been generated by applying EBF, LR and ensemble EBF-LR method with the help of training and eight causative factors dataset. The maps have been divided in to six classes; extremely low, very low, low, moderate, high and very high. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve has been used to accuracy assessment of the susceptibility map, and the area under curve (AUC) disclosures 87.9%, 85.2% and 84.1% prediction rate for the EBF-LR, EBF and LR model, respectively. This study is helpful to flood management program, dissection makers and planning in local administrative level.

AB  - Hazard identification and its ranking is one of the foundation steps of safety management. Nowadays, failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA), a reliability analysis tool, is widely used to identify, assess, and rank hazards/failure events related to products, processes, and services because of its simplistic nature. Traditional FMEA focuses on computing the risk priority number (RPN) to rank the identified hazards based on three risk factors, occurrence (O), severity (S), and detectability (D) of a failure mode (FM). However, the traditional RPN method has been criticized because of its limitations in the assessment of hazards/failure events, weighting of the risk factors, and prioritization of the FMs. Furthermore, experts usually provide rating on the risk factors based on their expertise, which introduces impreciseness, uncertainty, and vagueness in the subsequent assessments. In this study, Z-number is used to capture the uncertainty and unreliability associated with experts’ evaluation. Also, the concept of objectivity is deployed along with subjectivity in the weight calculation of the risk factors in the information assessment process. Classic VIKOR (ViseKriterijum-ska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) method is also extended in Z-environment to rank the identified hazards by incorporating the concepts of maximum group utility and minimum regret. For the illustration purpose, we have applied our proposed method in virtual prototyping based EOT crane operations. Sensitivity analysis and comparative evaluation with the existing methods are also presented to validate our proposed method.

AB  - The sea-level rise (SLR) resulting from climate change and flooding will threaten residents living in low-lying coastal zones in the coming decades. In this regard, evaluating social vulnerability as a significant component of flood risk reduction is necessary. Indicators, in conjunction with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, have been recently employed to quantify social vulnerability. In the present study, an indicator-based approach was developed to assess social vulnerability to SLR and flooding in Bandar Abbas city coastal district, southern Iran. To build a social vulnerability index (SoVI) indicators were firstly categorized in, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity components. Indicators were then weighted using MCDM methods (i.e., analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy AHP models). Subsequently, an additive weighting model was employed to produce social vulnerability maps at the block level, and under different combined flooding scenarios in 2050 and 2100. Results showed that using the fuzzy AHP does not necessarily change the ranks of indicators and components compared to the AHP model. However, the spatial extents of social vulnerability were entirely different for both models due to differences in indicators weight. It confirms that using the AHP model as a simplified method can be acceptable when determining indicators and components weight is required. Although, in the case of identifying the detailed spatial extents of social vulnerability using the fuzzy AHP might be appropriate. For all scenarios, using the AHP and fuzzy AHP model, most districts were classified as medium and low vulnerable, respectively. Moreover, the impact of SLR resulting from climate change was significantly evident in the eastern and western parts, where more districts were recognized as highly and very highly vulnerable in the worst-case scenario (S4-2100). The results of this study provide valuable comparative information that can be employed by decision-makers in coastal planning and risk reduction at local scales.

AB  - The building health has become an increasingly popular topic in recent years, as the health of a building is directly related to the safety and health of the users. A scientific evaluation of building health can help to assess building health issues and to avoid the catastrophic consequences of the building system failure. Although there are some building health evaluation methods for public buildings and residential buildings, there is a lack of approach for assessing the building health of commercial buildings. The study aims to propose an innovative and practical approach to evaluate the building health of commercial buildings by integrating the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), geographic information system (GIS), and building information modelling (BIM). Based on the AHP approach, the building health evaluation model is proposed to consider five aspects, including comfort performance (weight 5.15%), safety performance (weight 51.88%), environmental performance (weight 24.92%), operation management (weight 12.56%), and economic performance (weight 6.49%). It suggests that safety performance should be considered the most important factor in building health evaluation. Besides, a commercial project in Shenzhen, China was selected as a case study to validate the feasibility of the proposed evaluation model. Based on the results, the building health of the study case is scored as 6.9654 out of 10, which is ranked as intermediate. To be specific, the comfort performance scored 0.4515, safety performance scored 3.3344, environmental performance scored 2.2308, operation management scored 0.9019, and the economic performance scored 0.0972. Many recommendations have been made to improve the building health performance of the building, for instance, it recommends to reduce the energy consumption of the building to improve the economic performance of the building and the operation management performance. The developed model can help the governmental department regarding the building sector and asset manager to identify the building’s health performance and take further actions.

AB  - Smart logistics ecological chain (SLEC) consists of a supply ecological group, a core ecological logistics platform, and a demand ecological group. As a diversified industrial cluster, SLEC faces a complex internal and external environment, which makes high sustainable risks threatens the survival of SLEC members. To reduce the risks of SLEC, we first identify three kinds of risk factors, namely, the risks of SLEC members, technology risks, and external environmental risks. Then we adopt social network analysis (SNA) to construct a research framework for analyzing the relationships among risk factors of SLEC. Based on the results of the SNA, we further build a risk evaluation system based on the improved technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to evaluate the risks of different SLECs and achieve better global optimal risk control. Moreover, we use a case study of RRS logistics company to verify our research framework and evaluation system. The results show that, in the RRS home appliance SLEC, the risks of technological route change, government management risks, and industry management risks can easily lead to the generation of other risks, while external stakeholder risk, government management risk and internal stakeholder risk are easily induced by other risks. Besides, among the home appliance, fitness, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) SLECs of RRS logistics company, when in-node degree and out-node degree risks have the same weight, the risks of the home appliance SLEC are the lowest, while that of the FMCG SLEC are the highest.

AB  - In order to achieve an efficient and a successful operation and maintenance plan for assets, management personnel should have detailed information on the condition of the assets to make informed strategic decisions and properly plan expenditure of capital investments. Condition assessment models for sewage pipelines can be considered as a helpful tool to achieve such objective and from which a decision regarding the required and appropriate intervention can be made. This paper presents a review for the different physical, Artificial Intelligence and statistical models that have been developed to assess the condition of sewage pipelines over a period from 1998 through 2019. The description of different techniques used in building the condition assessment models, and the data required to construct these models are presented. In addition, the major disadvantages and limitations of using these techniques in developing the models have also been discussed. The conducted literature review indicates that various condition assessment models were capable of precisely forecasting the future condition of sewer pipelines. Most of the developed assessment models have been validated with various identified techniques to ensure the adequacy of the predictions. The main problem in model development arises from data availability and liability as several factors were identified by researchers to impact the deterioration of sewer pipelines. In order to overcome this problem, municipalities must utilize the new emerging technologies to facilitate gathering the required dataset in a complete and precise manner. Also, certain techniques such as evidential reasoning or Bayesian Belief Network can be used due to their capabilities in dealing with missing data. Furthermore, the influence of the factors on the pipe condition were identified by some researchers. Although there were discrepancies in the findings, but the majority concluded that both age and material factors have high influence and pipe slope has low influence.

AB  - This paper explains a procedure for developing a fuzzy analytical hierarchical process for a complete risk assessment in a textile industry. Risk assessment is a technique for identifying and measuring risk resulting from a specific work or event. We are using a safety model that characteristics aspects of human knowledge and thinking process for this risk assessment. The safety model uses a fuzzy logic approach employing IF-THEN guidelines. In the case study application, safety factors causing risks are weighted with triangular fuzzy numbers. These safety factors are assessed in light of framework by utilizing triangular fuzzy weights and fuzzy linguistic variables. The results are evaluated on the pairwise comparisons matrices of safety criteria with another criterion. These performance results indicate that this strategy is providing a satisfactory risk assessment value of hazards causes and relevant improvement strategies

AB  - Outsourcing has become an effective production and management measure to increase the resource utilization and production efficiency. However, performing a sustainability evaluation of the outsourcing faces some difficulties in constructing a unified dimensional evaluation model for integration of the quality, time, logistics cost and resources consumption. This paper proposes an emergy-based sustainability evaluation method for the outsourcing machining resources for improving resource utilization efficiency. Firstly, the scope and boundary are defined, and the processes of the method and preparation are illustrated. Then, emergy models for the sustainability evaluation that comprise production quality emergy, production time emergy, production logistics cost emergy and production resources consumption emergy models are established. An integrated assessment is performed to acquire a best plan of outsourcing machining, and the corresponding evaluation indicators can be determined. Finally, a case illustrates the practicability of the proposed method laying a foundation for sustainability evaluation and selection of the outsourcing machining resources.

AB  - The number of anthropogenic chemicals, manufactured, by-products, metabolites and abiotically formed transformation products, counts to hundreds of thousands, at present. Thus, humans and wildlife are exposed to complex mixtures, never one chemical at a time and rarely with only one dominating effect. Hence there is an urgent need to develop strategies on how exposure to multiple hazardous chemicals and the combination of their effects can be assessed. A workshop, “Advancing the Assessment of Chemical Mixtures and their Risks for Human Health and the Environment” was organized in May 2018 together with Joint Research Center in Ispra, EU-funded research projects and Commission Services and relevant EU agencies. This forum for researchers and policy-makers was created to discuss and identify gaps in risk assessment and governance of chemical mixtures as well as to discuss state of the art science and future research needs. Based on the presentations and discussions at this workshop we want to bring forward the following Key Messages:•We are at a turning point: multiple exposures and their combined effects require better management to protect public health and the environment from hazardous chemical mixtures.•Regulatory initiatives should be launched to investigate the opportunities for all relevant regulatory frameworks to include prospective mixture risk assessment and consider combined exposures to (real-life) chemical mixtures to humans and wildlife, across sectors.•Precautionary approaches and intermediate measures (e.g. Mixture Assessment Factor) can already be applied, although, definitive mixture risk assessments cannot be routinely conducted due to significant knowledge and data gaps.•A European strategy needs to be set, through stakeholder engagement, for the governance of combined exposure to multiple chemicals and mixtures. The strategy would include research aimed at scientific advancement in mechanistic understanding and modelling techniques, as well as research to address regulatory and policy needs. Without such a clear strategy, specific objectives and common priorities, research, and policies to address mixtures will likely remain scattered and insufficient.

AB  - This paper introduces the Best-Worst PROMETHEE method, which avoids the rank reversal problem of other PROMETHEE methods. We use this new technique to rank schools in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). We consider three separate outputs, provided by average student attainments in mathematics, language, and sciences. Our sample comprises 16,500 schools in 66 countries, and our results show significant differences between school performance both within and between countries. The top half of the ranking mainly comprises European and Asian countries, while the bottom half includes many North African, Middle Eastern, and South American countries. We find no strong association between inequality between schools and the country-level performance, suggesting the absence of a trade-off between equity and performance in education. The Best-Worst PROMETHEE is a generic method that can be used to support decisions in strategic sectors with multidimensional outcomes.

AB  - The paper presents a cleaner production and distribution model for global facility network that offers reverse logistics services under the warranty period. Hybrid manufacturing and storage facilities with flexible capacity are considered to save the extra setup and maintenance cost linked with establishing new reverse logistics facilities. The carbon emissions are accounted for the various activities related to product manufacturing and return. The carbon cap and trade policy is considered for regulating emissions. The dynamic mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model discussed in the paper optimizes the total cost of the network including costs associated with reverse logistics. The model is analysed on two hypothetical data sets. The results for the smaller data set reveal that the inventory holding is a better alternative to capacity expansion to deal with fluctuations in market demand. However, for the bigger data set, capacity expansion is recommended to satisfy the increased demand instead of relying completely on inventory management. The results are further analysed for varying carbon price and it is observed that increase in carbon price initially causes an increase in the carbon emissions but later it starts decreasing. This indicates that the increase in carbon price does not provide quick results and is more effective in controlling the emissions in the longer run. Furthermore, the proposed model investigates how different trade policies viz. free trade agreement (FTA), FTA with cap, and an increase in tariff barriers influence the total carbon emissions and the total cost. The results indicate that the total cost and the total emissions are relatively less under FTA with cap, however, there is a slight increase in the emissions of one country.

AB  - The technological advancements in the ubiquitous IoT era and the ever-growing desire of communities to enforce smart cities with security and safety of user data as their priority, mini Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are perceived as a tool for raising living standards by meeting the requirements of societies. Traditionally in UAV communication links, meshed ad hoc networks were among the first options of connectivity. However, the increased demand for deploying multi-UAV networks necessitates the development of a more robust and more secure networking infrastructure. In this regard, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm has proved to be the better alternative for multi-UAV communication since it can offer flexible services for management and control owing to its unique features such as decoupling control from UAVs and network programmability. Therefore, in this paper, we provide an overview of drone applications in SDN-enabled Drone Base Stations (DBS), surveillance monitoring and emergency networks, and review the performance assessment techniques and the associated cybersecurity aspects in these applications. Moreover, future research directions, after a thorough analysis of the literature, is presented in this paper. Through the development of an innovative and multifaceted drone performance-assessment framework with the primal concerns, that are meeting user-defined requirements and the provision of secure and reliable services, it is, therefore, necessary to advance in IoT-enabled spaces. We believe the present work is a step in the right direction, and it is essential for fastening the movement toward UAV-enabled smart cities.

AB  - Selecting the most suitable location for a mineral processing plant is of vital importance for achieving the highest throughput and lowering overall costs. The aim of the research is to select the best location for a gilsonite processing plant (Kermanshah Province, Iran). First, laboratory scale concentration experiments were conducted to determine the most suitable concentration technique for the material from all gilsonite mines nearby. It was concluded that, one production line is enough to concentrate of the material from all mines by flotation method. Afterwards, the effective criteria for locating the processing plant were identified as processing, facilities and infrastructure, mining, environmental, geographical, social and cultural, legal, geological and finally technical and technological factors. Considering the multiplicity of effective factors and interactions between them, fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) method is used for ranking of the factors. A survey for the evaluation of each factor was conducted through interviewing a number of experts in various mining engineering fields. Then, the FCM method was used to determine the weights of each factor. The results show that distribution of mines is the most important factor. In order to determine the appropriate site for installation of the plant, 4 sites were selected in the vicinity of larger mines by investigating the geological maps, using Geological Information System (GIS), aerial photos and objective visits. In order to obtain the global weights of alternatives, the local weights obtained from FCM and FAHP methods were combined. According to the results, site No.4, located at longitude 34˚ 18′28″ and latitude 45˚ 41′ 49″ was proposed as the best location.

AB  - Railway level crossing closures can disrupt traffic flow significantly, especially in peak hours. The current increases in road and rail traffic worsen the situation and can result in congestion known to significantly increase road users’ travel times. In this study, seven of the most problematic level crossings around Brisbane, Australia, were surveyed. The effectiveness of a set of treatments was tested and discussed using computer simulation models. The study found that the variability of warning times is the major cause of unnecessary boom gate downtime. Our observations showed that warning times could be reduced by 10–40 s on average for each crossing activation at the investigated sites. A major cause for the variability in warning times are trains stopping at stations that are not equipped with express train identification, and actual train speeds being lower than posted line speeds. Various tested treatments were found to be effective at reducing level crossing closure duration and reducing the variability in warning times, resulting in travel times reducing by 7–57% for road users, depending on the level crossing considered. This study shows the potential for the short to medium-term treatment of congestion issues at active level crossings, which are necessary with the current increased rail and road traffic flows.

AB  - Recently, manufacturing sectors are undergoing several sustainable transformations in their production process. These transformation in the production is majorly due to the competitiveness between industries to reduce cost and wages incurred during the production process. In order to achieve mass production in reduced time, provide customer satisfaction, for dynamic management of customer orders and to cope with limited time to market the product, manufacturing industries use cloud based technologies. Cloud manufacturing offers leasing and utilizing manufacturing possessions, whenever the needed resources are based on demand to promote elasticity. This investigation addresses scheduling issues in cloud manufacturing, because when manufacturing tasks and resources in an enterprise is not properly scheduled, the cost and time of utilizing those resources override business profit. In this investigation, scheduling is done by considering workflow analysis on ceiling fan SMEs as case study and the performance of workflow was experimented. The major idea of this work is to optimize the workflow and integrate SMEs related to ceiling fan sectors in manufacturing lines. Scheduling and mapping tasks and resources is carried through Particle Swam Optimization (PSO) and the results were analyzed at different levels. The results show that, PSO is well suited because of its advantage on global convergence in the solution space.

AB  - Direct-expansion solar-assisted heat pump water heaters (DX-SAHPWHs) are conducive to the environment due to the use of ambient energy and solar radiation. This paper aims to design and develop a thermodynamic model and a multi-criteria optimization of thermal performance for a DX-SAHPWH using R-134a as the working refrigerant that supplies domestic hot water for a typical building throughout the whole year. The thermodynamic model of the DX-SAHPWH is developed so that the performance of the system is solved through the try and error technique with the least initial data of the thermodynamic cycle of DX-SAHPWH. After the validation of the thermodynamic model, the performance of the DX-SAHPWH is analyzed for a typical building located at the temperate climate of Iran. Then, a parametric study is conducted to identify how various design parameters may affect the performance of the DX-SAHPWH system. In the current investigation, the effects of design parameters including solar radiation intensity, ambient air temperature, outlet water temperature of the condenser, solar collector area, compressor speed, length of tube in the condenser, external diameter of the tube in collector plate, fin thickness, and thermal conductivity of collector plate on the performance of the DX-SAHPWH are investigated. Besides, single and bi-criteria optimizations are carried out using genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain the optimal solutions of design parameters, where the coefficient of performance (COP) and the solar collector efficiency (SCE) are selected as two fitness functions. The optimal solutions achieved from the bi-criteria optimization process will be given as Pareto frontier. The final optimum solution from the available solutions on the Pareto optimal frontier is selected using decision-making methods, such as LINMAP, TOPSIS, and Shannon’s Entropy. The comparison of single and bi-criteria optimization results illustrate that the bi-criteria optimization method yields more proper results than single ones, mainly because of the lower deviation index from the ideal solution. The results of bi-criteria optimization show that SCE decreases 1.6% compared to the initial model while the COP increases close to 20% that makes the optimum solution more desirable compared to the single ones. Moreover, the performance of the optimized DX-SAHPWH system is compared with the initial model in each month of the year. The results indicate that the performance of the optimized DX-SAHPWH is highly improved so that the working hours of the system decrease close to 109 h compared to the initial model during the whole year.

AB  - In this paper, the strategic planning of sugar-bioethanol supply chains (SCs) under deep uncertainty has been addressed by applying a two-stage scenario-based multiobjective optimisation methodology. In practice, the depth of uncertainty is very high, potential outcomes are not precisely enumerable, and probabilities of outcomes are not properly definable. To date, no appropriate framework has been suggested for dealing with deep uncertainty in supply chain management and energy-related problems. This study is the first try to fills this gap. Particularly, the sustainability of the whole infrastructure of the sugar-bioethanol SCs is analysed in such a way that the final solutions are sustainable, robust and adaptable for a broad range of plausible futures. Three objectives are considered in this problem under six uncertain parameters. A case study of South African sugarcane industry is utilised to study and examine the proposed model. The results prove the economic profitability and sustainability of the project.

AB  - Systematic interactions between buildings, vehicles, and renewables can increase eco-economic viability on a neighbourhood scale. In this study, an interactive buildings-vehicles energy sharing network with multidirectional energy interactions was formulated for energy interactions and integrations together with a grid-responsive strategy for the management of off-peak renewable energy and grid electricity. Energy flexibility indicators (e.g., off-peak surplus renewable shifted ratio and off-peak grid shifted ratio) were introduced, developed, and implemented in an interactive buildings-vehicles energy sharing network for the energy flexibility assessment. Several energy-related conflicts, such as energy congestion contradiction and energy-related economic and environmental conflicts, were presented and discussed together with effective solutions provided to decision-makers for optimal design and robust operation. To reach a trade-off between energy-related conflicts, multi-objective optimisation was conducted, and implemented with an advanced multi-objective optimisation algorithm (called Pareto archive NSGA-II). The research results show that the formulated interactive buildings-vehicles energy sharing network demonstrates greater robustness and competitiveness than the conventional isolated system in terms of cost, emissions, and energy flexibility. Regarding multiple energy-related conflicts in the formulated interactive energy sharing network, the results show that multi-objective optimisation is able to decrease the equivalent CO2 emissions of the buildings-vehicles energy system by 7.5%, from 147.4 to 136.4 kg/m2.a, and reduce the import cost from the electric grid by 8.5%, from 212.7 to 194.6 HK$/m2.a, together with a high energy flexibility: a maximum of 11.03% (1.5% in a conventional isolated system) of the off-peak grid electricity can be stored by the electrical storages and a maximum of 52.48% (33.6% in the conventional isolated system) of the off-peak surplus renewable electricity can be shifted to peak period. This study formulates an interactive energy sharing network between buildings and vehicles, together with quantifiable energy flexibility assessment criteria and effective solutions for dealing with multiple energy-related conflicts, which are critical for interactive buildings-vehicles energy sharing networks with high energy flexibilities in smart cities.

This study thus presents an integrated methodology for forensic accounting implementation to improve the identification of the strategy map relationship between the Balanced Scorecard (BSC)-based perspective and criteria, by combining multiple-criteria decision making (MCDM) with the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) techniques. The results have implications for corporate decision-makers to effectively fulfil corporate governance quality assurance and anti-fraud through a forensic accounting strategy map illustration. From the evaluation and planning perspective, the in-depth analysis of strategy map is useful to obtain an interrelationship that takes as its starting point the practice professions of the decision maker to improve existing strategy alternatives and focus on the valuable strategy paths. In the evaluation planning application, a strategy map of forensic accounting presents the knowledge regarding key indicators’ priorities to achieve satisfactory strategy planning and to practice forensic accounting development linked to fraud risk management in Taiwan.

AB  - Several energy transition plans attempt to establish low-carbon practices towards a circular bio-economy in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, most actions only try to assuage the impacts of climate change without improving the resource flows generated by human activities. In this paper, we propose a semi-quantitative assessment of the impacts of biowaste-based energy transition by engaging all relevant social stakeholders' evaluation in the strategic plan. This holistic approach models a Decision Support System (DSS) to effectively evaluate the interplay of local and sectoral low-carbon actions. Regional energy alliances and stakeholders are used for participatory modeling to promote the buildup of the learning base of this DSS. The core pillar of the DSS involves the application of advanced features of soft computing for the development of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) that elicits the inter-causalities of the critical factors affecting the energy transitions towards bio-economy options. The concepts participating in the map are established by experts, and their interrelations via a learning process that utilizes survey statistics. The strands of research include scenarios to highlight the effect of energy provision to urbanization and the increase of urban actors (social, technological, political) in influencing the decision making related to low-carbon policies. Particularly, we study a use case of a Greek region that, despite its munificent agricultural production, also disclosures a stimulated manufacturing economy sector. The proposed decision making tool uses analytics and optimization algorithms to guide competent authorities and decision makers to sustainable energy transitioning towards decarbonization.

AB  - Urban rail traffic congestion is becoming increasingly serious due to the large traffic demands in modern cities. In order to ensure the safety and quality of station services in peak hours, it's necessary to adopt some reasonable and effective passenger flow control strategies. In this study, through considering the time-dependent passenger demands, a passenger flow control model based on the network-level system is explicitly developed. The passenger successive motion process is discretized by the modeling method. Systematically considering the coordinated relationship between traffic demands and strict capacity constraints (including station passing capacity, platform load capacity and train transport capacity), we establish a mixed integer linear programming model to minimize the total passenger waiting time (including passengers outside stations and on the platforms). The optimization software Cplex is adopted to solve the developed model, and a real network of Beijing urban railway is calibrated to verify the effectiveness of the suggested model. As a result, the proposed flow control strategies can provide detailed information about control stations, control durations and control intensities, and can effectively reduce the total waiting time and relieve the number of stranded passengers in the urban rail transit network.

AB  - Abandoned coal mine reutilization plays a critical role in the sustainable development of the mining industry. Scientific decisions on reuse modes are a prerequisite and crucial issue to efficiently explore the idle resources of abandoned mines. This paper classified the reuse modes into 6 types with 19 sub-patterns and generalized the influence conditions into 3 categories with 17 sub-indexes, including mine conditions, natural and geological conditions, and supplementary conditions based on literature review and data sources. A logical deduction method named “condition-mode” was proposed from the constraint conditions and their degree of constraint to select the preliminary reutilization patterns of abandoned mines. Finally, a practical example of the Beijing west mining area was introduced to demonstrate the applicability and feasibility of the proposed method. The results indicate that this method can be employed to select some potential reuse patterns for abandoned underground coal mines. The most important implications are that the significance of more detailed analyses and techno-economic appraisals on multiple schemes from these decision results, which suggests a stepwise integration approach to generate a more promising subset of inference results. The research can provide a reference for the reuse of underground coal mines that have been closed or will be closed.

AB  - The article presents the results of the study, which is a fragment of the work carried out under the project entitled “Hybrid system for intelligent diagnostics of prognostic models”, co-financed through the National Centre for Research and Development from the European Regional Development Fund. The aim of the study was to analyse the effectiveness of methods based on rough set theory in binary classification tasks, on the example of cash loans granted. In accordance with the assumptions for the construction of the hybrid system, it was assumed that an important criterion for the selection of methods included in various scenarios of implemented research procedures is their automation, starting from machine selection of features, through machine discretization and model construction until obtaining classification results. Based on the results of preliminary tests, the research procedure was established, which included the use of: 1) the method of random undersampling in order to balance training data set, 2) heuristic MD algorithm (Maximum Discernibility) for discretization and reduction of variables, and 3) LEM 2 algorithm for generating the minimal set of rules for decision-making. In subsequent scenarios, the basic research procedure was extended by the stage of initial reduction of features using two filtration methods, CFS and SU-FCBF, and using the results of the expert approach commonly used in the construction of logistic regression models. By adding the number of sub-scenarios, a total of 242 different classification results were obtained. These results showed that the use of filtration methods resulted in a significant improvement in the results of rule classification.

AB  - In consideration of the general lack of trust in human professional financial advisors due to conflicts of interest, and given inadequacies in terms of the utility of FinTech alternatives for financial goal recommendations, this study establishes a framework for an ontology-based, multiagent recommender system designed to improve financial capability through the recommendation of financial goals, called FinPathlight. The FinPathlight framework provides an architecture for a personal financial recommender system designed to identify and recommend specific, achievable financial goals appropriate to a wide range of financially situated users. This framework contributes principles of implementation for a novel financial technology (FinTech) application aimed at addressing a pervasive lack of trust surrounding traditional financial advisory services, as well as utility inadequacies within the current landscape for FinTech applications, providing a comprehensive set of practical and explicit financial goal recommendations. Considering the importance of users' adoption of an innovation, this study empirically tests its utility in terms of trust and perceived usefulness. The experimental evaluation results show that an application built using this framework would likely be perceived as trustworthy and useful to users for identification and selection of financial capability enhancing objectives.

AB  - According to the entropy theory, the increase in the thermodynamic entropy of energy is reduced under the control of the information entropy. However, the quantitative analysis of this process remains difficult. In this study, energy properties are conferred upon information to enable an uncertain event to be measured. First, the entropy theory was adopted to describe the uncertainty of the energy in a distributed energy system. Further, a method was devised to optimize the configurations of the distributed energy system based on minimize total entropy generation. Finally, using the example of load forecasting, the impact of introducing information in the form of negative entropy on the ability of the system to improve the alignment between supply and demand is quantitatively elucidated. The negative entropy caused by information utilization increased from 356.14 to 638.68 kWh/K, with the load forecasting errors decreased from 30% to 10%. The information entropy was also applied to describe the uncertainty of the On-site energy fraction, by increasing the capacity of energy storage, the uncertainty decreased from 1.81 to 1.80 nat, while the load forecasting could decreased it to 1.71 nat, 1.54 nat, 1.29 nat with the load forecasting errors at 30%, 20% and 10%, respectively.

AB  - All successful cities are the most developed and productive cities in their regions and countries in terms of economy and quality of life. In addition, it is observed that there are strong industries and enterprises in these regions and cities. Therefore, this study tries to evaluate the quality of life and the development of the industry together. The proposed method can be considered as a combination of operational research and GIS (Geographical Information System). The results of both approaches support each other. In addition, the innovative approaches of the sectors are evaluated by TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). Also, the article recommends SMEs (Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) for sustainable economic growth. According to the results, the quality of life and socio-economic development has a very close relationship with the existence of investments and manufacturing companies. If the current development policy continues, the regions with low quality of life will continue to lag behind the other cities in terms of development. The study indicates that there are remarkable differences between eastern and western Turkey in terms of living standards and the contribution of SMEs to economic development.

AB  - The upper Kangsabati river basin is situated on the extended part of ‘Chhotanagpur Granitic or Granite Gneiss Complex’ (CGGC) of West Bengal and Jharkhand. People of this hard rock terrain suffer severely from water scarcity during scorching summer. To delineate groundwater potential zones of the study region, seven hydro-geological factors, such as geology, lineament, slope, drainage, rainfall, soil and land use land cover are considered. The Cartosat-1 DEM of IRS, LISS-3 image of IRS, geological map of GSI, soil map of NBSS&LUP and rainfall data of CWC are arranged and processed in ArcGIS, Erdas Imagine and PCI Geometica softwares as per requirements to prepare seven individual thematic layers. To assign proper weight of an individual factor based on its level of influence in the occurrence of groundwater, the AHP model is adopted to serve the purpose. Finally, the map of the groundwater potential zones is produced by integrating all the seven layers into one in ArcGIS software. The map of groundwater potential zones of the upper Kangsabati river basin shows that an area of 1819.45 km2 (53.33%) is of good to very good potentiality of groundwater. Only an area of 591.23 km2 (17.34%) is identified as very poor to poor zones of groundwater prospect. The verification of the study is also done by computing an accuracy assessment. The result of the overall accuracy assessment of the study is recorded to be 79.77%, while the Kappa co-efficient is calculated to be 0.73.

AB  - Background and objective
Dataset imbalance is an important problem in neuroimaging. Imbalanced datasets would cause the performance degradation of a classifier by utilizing imbalanced learning, which tends to overfocus on the majority class. In this paper, we consider an imbalanced neuroimaging classification problem, namely, classification of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.
Methods
We propose a multi-objective classification scheme based on support vector machine (SVM). Our scheme addresses the imbalanced dataset problem by using a three objective SVM model with the positive and negative empirical errors being handled explicitly and separately. Moreover, an interactive multi-objective method incorporating the decision maker's preference is adopted, thus a preferred subset of pareto optimal classifiers for decision making can be obtained.
Results
The proposed scheme is assessed on five datasets from the ADHD- 200 consortium. Numerical results show that the proposed multi-objective scheme considerably outperforms some traditional classification methods in the literature.
Conclusion
The proposed multi-objective classification scheme avoids hyper-parameter selection, it effectively addresses dataset imbalanced problem from algorithm level. The scheme can not only be used in the diagnosis of ADHD but also in the diagnosis of other diseases, such as Alzheimer and Autism etc.

AB  - Reviewers play a significant role in academic peer review activities, including conference paper assignment and funding selection, because their evaluation of proposals impacts the final decision. Several studies have proposed reviewer selection strategies or reviewer evaluation methods for solving the problem of selecting appropriate reviewers. Identifying reviewers who are familiar with the proposals to be reviewed is the objective of the reviewer assignment problem. However, the majority of the existing studies ignore quantitative constraints with respect to the articles assigned to the reviewers during the review process. In this study, we propose a novel optimization model with several review condition constraints to address the reviewer assignment problem. In the proposed model, the expertise and research areas of the candidate reviewers and proposals are identified using semantic topic models, which are demonstrated to be effective when measuring the relevance of the reviewers with respect to the proposals to be reviewed; further, the computational efficiency is improved owing to the reduced representation dimensionality. Herein, an improved heuristic algorithm is proposed to match reviewers and papers based on specific topic areas, and candidate reviewers are assigned to each proposal under the global optimum condition based on their overall performance values. Subsequently, an empirical test is conducted using a conference reviewer dataset. The obtained results show that the proposed model can help the managers to efficiently and effectively select reviewers in terms of the convergence rate and convergence level when compared with several classic benchmarks.
