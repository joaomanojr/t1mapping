AB  - Extant literature on sustainability in procurement and supplier selection suffers from a number of deficiencies. First, studies pertaining to the dynamic nature of stakeholders’ expectations of sustainability and its impact on determining a supply portfolio have not been studied before. Second, there is a genuine lack of study linking the stakeholders’ sustainability requirements, firm procurement strategies, and eventual supplier selection. Third, most of the existing studies address sustainability issues in procurement and supplier selection but fall short of determining an optimal portfolio of suppliers and corresponding optimal order quantities. This study addresses the above research gaps by developing a sustainability-focused multi-criteria decision model for supplier evaluation and determining optimal order allocation among the suppliers linking the stakeholders’ sustainability requirements and firm procurement strategies. Based on dynamic capability theory, we develop a decision support framework integrating multi-phased quality function deployment and dynamic optimization. We apply the decision support framework to a European apparel company which sources apparel from Bangladesh: a country that is a low cost sourcing destination. First, this study identifies the stakeholders’ sustainability requirements. It then explicates the company’s procurement strategies in terms of stakeholders’ requirements followed by translating the procurement strategies to relevant supplier assessment criteria. Finally, a linear optimization model is developed to maximize the suppliers’ sustainability performance in order to determine the optimal supply portfolio. The results identify two distinct groups of suppliers satisfying the overall sustainability performance. However the optimal order quantities among the suppliers vary randomly depending on the variations in demand and priority weights of the suppliers. The paper concludes with a detailed discussion of the results and implications.

AB  - Avian influenza (AIV) is a highly contagious virus that can infect both wild birds and domestic poultry. This study aimed to define areas within the state of South Carolina (SC) at heightened risk for environmental persistence of AIV using geospatial methods. Environmental factors known to influence AIV survival were identified through the published literature and using a multi-criteria decision analysis with GIS was performed. Risk was defined using five categories following the World Organization for Animal Health Risk Assessment Guidelines. Less than 1% of 1km grid cells in SC showed a high risk of AIV persistence. Approximately 2% - 17% of counties with high or very high environmental risk also had medium to very high numbers of commercial poultry operations. Results can be used to improve surveillance activities and to inform biosecurity practices and emergency preparedness efforts.

AB  - Many organizations use wearable devices to increase their operational efficiency and strengthen their competitive advantage. In such decisions, managers can find it difficult to select the right device for their company. To address the Smart Watch (SW) selection problem, this article introduces an assessment framework established on a Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic (HFL) Multi-Criteria Decision-Making technique to collectively consider parameters affecting the eventual decision. Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTS) are utilized to integrate choices of decision makers into the decision-making procedure, where their thoughts and ideas about a decision problem can be of an uncertain nature, making it hard to express their assessments with crisp numbers. The proposed method handles the partiality in decision-making processes with a Group Decision Making (GDM) approach. This paper first showcases an integrated HFL Simple Additive Weighting (SAW)-HFL Additive Ratio ASsessment (ARAS) method. The framework’s functionality is then illustrated in a case study about SW assessment. The originality of the paper is based on its evaluation framework using an integrated SAW-ARAS approach in the hesitant fuzzy environment, its research method and case application in the logistics sector. This approach can guide managers and practitioners for an effective SW selection process.

AB  - The way electorates were influenced to vote for the Brexit referendum, and in presidential elections both in Brazil and the USA, has accelerated a debate about whether and how machine learning techniques can influence citizens’ decisions. The access to balanced information is endangered if digital political manipulation can influence voters. The techniques of profiling and targeting on social media platforms can be used for advertising as well as for propaganda: Through tracking of a person's online behaviour, algorithms of social media platforms can create profiles of users. These can be used for the provision of recommendations or pieces of information to specific target groups. As a result, propaganda and disinformation can influence the opinions and (election) decisions of voters much more powerfully than previously. In order to counter disinformation and societal polarization, the paper proposes a responsibility-based approach for social media platforms in diverse political contexts. Based on the implementation requirements of the “Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence” of the European Commission, the ethical principles will be operationalized, as far as they are directly relevant for the safeguarding of democratic societies. The resulting suggestions show how the social media platform providers can minimize risks for societies through responsible action in the fields of human rights, education and transparency of algorithmic decisions.

AB  - The requirement specification process is an important part of a project and has the potential to prevent problems that may last for years after a project is delivered. Previous studies on the requirement specification process have focused on clarifying stated fuzzy terms in software requirement engineering. However, in many projects there is information that is not stated, but it is implied and can be inferred. This hidden information is usually ignored due to the assumption that ‘the provider understands what they mean/need’. This assumption is not always true. Such information, if extracted, may include fuzzy terms, namely hidden fuzzy terms (HFTs), which need specification. Therefore, these fuzzy terms have to be identified and then specified to avoid potential future consequences. This study proposes an algorithm to extract the hidden fuzzy terms, utilises a fuzzy inference system (FIS) to specify them, and applies the best worst multi-criteria decision making method (BWM) to evaluate the delivered product and measure the performance of the provider. The model is then used to examine a case from Defence Housing Australia. Such evaluation and measurement enable the project owner/manager to have a transparent basis to support decisions later in different phases of the project, and to ultimately reduce the likelihood of conflict and the receipt of an unsatisfactory product.

AB  - Maintenance planning and risk evaluation of public transport systems (PTS) is completely critical and important for the natural structure and ecological balance of the city and its’ environment. It is noteworthy to take the correct actions and decisions for the process to make a significant contribution towards the development and ecological sustainability of the city. We also know that failures occurring in PTS leads to personal and social damages such as hazards for passenger life and financial loss that occurs as a result of damage to vehicles due to these failures. Therefore, it is essential to analyze failures of PTS and to improve maintenance planning for obtain a reliable transport system. For this aim, a systematic approach based on maintenance decision support system has been suggested to eliminate the risks arising from failures for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in this paper. The suggested system aims to minimize the harmful effects of these risks with respect to individuals, society and environment perspectives. The proposed integrated systematic approach consists of fuzzy rule based system (FRBS), fuzzy multi criteria decision making (MCDM), stochastic MCDM, mathematical modelling, information theory and heuristic approaches. The mathematical modeling has been applied to evaluate membership functions (MFs) of FRBS and a heuristic approach named particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been also used to solve the problem. Additionally, MCDM methods are also used to prioritize the failures and to determine weights of them. The suggested systematic approach has been applied on a real case study for BRT system in Istanbul and some actions that includes more details and information about risks and failures have been suggested to obtain a more effective maintenance plan. The validity analysis also confirmed the obtained results of the suggested systematic approach.

AB  - This paper aims to review the publications in the field of Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) of building energy retrofitting. The main focus is to demonstrate the methodological assumptions, limitations and advancements in recent publications to provide a basis for future research works through a critical review on adopted methods and research gaps in the literature. Energy retrofitting of existing buildings is a promising action plan to reduce the environmental impacts of the built environment due to the low energy performance in existing buildings and low new construction rate in the developed countries. Taking an LCSA approach helps to have comprehensive analyses of the costs and benefits of Energy Retrofitting Projects (ERPs) over the building life cycle. Performing LCSA in ERPs is a challenging task because of the extensive required data analysis, uncertain parameters, complicated assessment methods etc. These challenges indicate the importance of a critical review study to understand how LCSA is applied in energy retrofit projects. The publications are analyzed in four categories which are LCA, LCC, S-LCA and multi-dimensional life cycle studies. Finally, limitations and advancements in the reviewed papers are highlighted and discussed to be considered in future studies.

AB  - The main goal of the study was to estimate the efficiency and predictive ability of a series of tree-based ensemble methods in groundwater spring potential mapping. The study introduces a novel hybrid integration approach based on J48 Decision Trees (J48), AdaBoost (AB), Bagging (Bag), RandomSubSpace (RS), Dagging (Dag) and Rotation Forest (RF) algorithms for constructing a groundwater spring potential map. The performance of the ensemble models were evaluated at the Wuqi County in Shaanxi Province, China. At first, a groundwater spring inventory map with 235 groundwater springs was constructed. The groundwater spring database was randomly divided into a training (70% of the total number of groundwater springs) and validating subset (remaining 30%). Secondly, sixteen groundwater spring related variables were selected and analyzed, such as elevation, slope, aspect, planform and profile curvature, curvature, topographic wetness index, stream transport and stream power indexes, distance from river network, lithology, soil and landuse cover, normalized difference vegetation index, mean annual rainfall and distance from road network. The contribution of each groundwater spring related variable so as to identify the most predictive was based on the correlation attribute evaluation method. The predictive performance of each model was evaluated by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and several statistical indexes (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity). The outcomes revealed that all models had a good predictive performance, having AUC values greater than 0.74. Specifically, RF-J48 model appeared with the highest prediction capability (AUC = 0.797), followed by the AB-J48 model (0.793), the Bag-J48 (0.768), the RS-J48 (0.766) and the Dag-J48 (0.748), respectively. The study highlights that the proposed ensemble methodology is efficient and highly accurate appropriate for groundwater spring potential mapping.

AB  - Occupant behavior in residential buildings has a direct impact on the effectiveness of energy-saving measures. In order to realize a buildings’ carbon mitigation targets, the impact of individual occupancy profiles needs to be integrated with building simulation models. This paper introduces a decision support framework as a potential solution to make energy performance upgrade choices based on different occupancy profiles. This framework has been demonstrated through a case study of two single-family detached homes in Canada, which were highly instrumented with sensors for monitoring energy input and output. The case studies represented two common occupancy profiles-(1) a family of four (consisting of 2 working adults and 2 teenagers); and (2) a retired couple. Firstly, calibrated energy models were developed by using one-year energy use data collected through an intrusive load monitoring technique. Secondly, energy upgrade combinations were considered for each profile and tested for additional investment, payback period and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Lastly, the most suitable combination of energy upgrade for each profile was ranked using a multi-criteria decision-making method (e.g., TOPSIS). Results indicated that the retired couple used more energy than the family of four and required energy upgrades with usually higher payback periods to achieve the same level of GHG emission reduction. The results of this research are timely for energy policymaking and developing best management practices, which need to be implemented along with the deployment of more stringent building standards and codes.

In this sense, although studies in the literature bring hybrid multi-criteria decision making models based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis’ (DEA) techniques, none fill gaps inherent in DEA, regarding inputs and outputs’ selection, specially involving the performance management of HUFs. Thus, this paper aimed to measure the performance of Brazilian HUFs participating in the REHUF, through the use of the multivariate statistical technique, Principal Component Analysis, and the use of Data Envelopment Analysis, covering theoretical and practical contributions to the academy and hospital organizations. This paper also presented a descriptive and quantitative character; followed the exploratory purpose and the inductive logic, being empirically structured in three stages. In general, it could be inferred that the hospitals characterized as inefficient, so were with regard to the production of medicine residents (MR), by specialty area, for the year 2014. Therefore, they presented a context constituted by high inputs’ consumption, for an average production not so high MR, among the specialties. However, it was showed, throughout the paper, that efficient hospitals have also obtained similar results, but at the cost of lower inputs’ consumption.

AB  - In recent years, with continuous focus on clean energy and environmental protection, the scale of photovoltaic generation industry in China has been gradually expanded, making great achievements. However, it also faces huge challenges and problems such as fierce market competition, serious photovoltaic curtailment, high cost, etc. In order to promote the sustainable development of photovoltaic industry, this paper constructs an energy storage-involved photovoltaic value chain (ES-PVC) consisting of three nodes for upstream, midstream and downstream, in which photovoltaic power suppliers, battery energy storage business and electric vehicle manufacturers locate respectively. The coupling problem for node enterprises in the value chain is studied by multi-objective optimization and G1 method, which is measured eventually via a single value transformed by ideal point method. Considering the particularity of issue, the paper proposes an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) to fit and solve the model. A best value chain is acquired via proposed approach whose feasibility and applicability are verified through comparative analysis with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and linear assignment method (LAM) and sensitivity analysis. The implications and limitations are presented in the conclusion, aiming to provide theoretical reference for value management of photovoltaic enterprise and to get further research.

AB  - Expected to operate in the imminent future, air taxi service (ATS) is an aerial on-demand transport for a single passenger or a small group of riders, which seeks to transform the method of everyday commute. This uncharted territory in the emerging transportation world is anticipated to enable consumers bypass traffic congestion in urban road networks. By adopting an electric vertical takeoff and landing concept (eVTOL), air taxis could be operational from skyports retrofitted on building rooftops, thus gaining advantage from an implementation standpoint. Motivated by the potential impact of ATS, this study provides a review of air taxi systems and associated operations. We first discuss the current developments in the ATS (demand prediction, air taxi network design, and vehicle configuration). Next, we anticipate potential future challenges of ATS from an operations management perspective, and review the existing literature that could be leveraged to tackle these problems (ride-matching, pricing strategies, vehicle maintenance scheduling, and pilot training and recruitment). Finally, we detail future research opportunities in the air taxi domain.

AB  - In this study, engine operating conditions which given the best result in terms of performance, exhaust emission and combustion characteristics in a thermal barrier coated (TBC) diesel engine, which was covered with ceramic on combustion chamber elements, were determined by multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. It was also included in the optimization of the data obtained from the uncoated (standard) engine (STD) in order to better evaluate the TBC engine. In the experimental study, diesel, pure biodiesel derived from cotton oil frying waste and biodiesel/diesel blend fuels (5, 20 and 50% by volume) were used as fuel. In optimization, operational competitiveness rating (OCRA) was preferred as a MCDM. The experimental data, which included a total of six hundred data, in TBC and STD engines fueled biodiesel and its blends were used in optimization. According to the optimization result, the best results in terms of engine performance, exhaust emission and combustion characteristics were generally obtained from the TBC engine. According to the optimization sequence, the ranking obtained from the TBC engine were observed to be ahead of the STD engine at all engine speeds. It was also found that the best results were concentrated at engine speeds of 1800 rpm and 2100 rpm. The best result was achieved by using B20 (20% biodiesel + 80% diesel) in TBC engine at 1800 rpm. The performance, emission and combustion characteristics obtained under these optimum operating parameters (OOP) were also compared with those of the STD engine fueled with B0 and B100.

AB  - The geomorphometric analysis of watersheds provides useful quantitative information on stream hydrology and potential landscape change that can be used by soil conservation decision makers to determine areas prone to land degradation. In this study, we develop a methodology for the assessment of catchment-scale sensitivity to sediment yield using various topo-hydrological, vegetation, and climatic parameters using four multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques: the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), weighted-sum analysis (WSA), and combined factor (CF). To identify the most important factors affecting sediment yield and soil erosion, a model incorporating principle component analysis with MCDM was devised, using infiltration number (IF), drainage density (Dd), length of overland flow (Lo), channel maintenance (C), stream frequency (Fs), and ruggedness number (Rn) as indices of sediment and erosion risk. Data from a previous study that employed the RUSLE3D model and sediment-yield field data were used to validate the results. The TOPSIS model achieved the highest correlation with the RUSLE3D results. The correlation of watershed activities to the experimental erosion and sediment prioritization results is 0.32. The TOPSIS results indicate that all 23 sub-watersheds yielded moderate amounts of sediment. Based on the VIKOR method, 17.39% (78.96 km2) of the region was classified as having very high erodibility, 26.08% (241.93 km2) high erodibility, 34.78% (225.95 km2) moderate erodibility, and 21.73% (105.05 km2) low erodibility. Considering the high sensitivity of Taleghan watershed to soil erosion, it is recommended that conservation efforts be implemented to minimize land degradation in the area. This methodology can be adapted to other regions that lack detailed topo-hydrological, vegetation, or climatic data.

AB  - Kapıkule Border Crossing, the second busiest land border crossing point in the world and the busiest in Europe, has become inadequate to process the increasing number of trucks transporting goods between Europe and Turkey. To address this issue, in a previous study, a detailed process analysis was conducted, a simulation model was developed, and several action plans representing improvement strategies were analyzed and ranked in terms of the daily average number of trucks waiting in the queue to enter and leave the border crossing. However, to increase the efficiency of Kapıkule Border Crossing, the ranking of the action plans should not be solely based on the average number of trucks but should also be evaluated from a much broader perspective taking into account several objectives that are generally in conflict with each other. Therefore, in this study, we propose a multi-criteria decision support methodology that evaluates these action plans by considering additional attributes; such as investment cost, operations cost, sustainability, border security, and the satisfaction of the beneficiaries, establishing a preference ranking of action plans to improve the capacity of the Border Crossing. Our results have implications for policymakers not only in Turkey but also in the EU.

AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is, undeniably, a substantial shock to our civilization which has revealed the value of public services that relate to public health. Ensuring a safe and reliable water supply and maintaining water sanitation has become ever more critical during the pandemic. For this reason, researchers and practitioners have promptly investigated the impact associated with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on water treatment processes, focusing specifically on water disinfection. However, the COVID-19 pandemic impacts multiple aspects of the urban water sector besides those related to the engineering processes, including sanitary, economic, and social consequences which can have significant effects in the near future. Furthermore, this outbreak appears at a time when the water sector was already experiencing a fourth revolution, transitioning toward the digitalisation of the sector, which redefines the Water-Human-Data Nexus. In this contribution, a product of collaboration between academics and practitioners from water utilities, we delve into the multiple impacts that the pandemic is currently causing and their possible consequences in the future. We show how the digitalisation of the water sector can provide useful approaches and tools to help address the impact of the pandemic. We expect this discussion to contribute not only to current challenges, but also to the conceptualization of new projects and the broader task of ameliorating climate change.

AB  - Urban green amenities provide many environmental and social benefits that are important for urban landscapes, natural ecosystems and their services. Amenity-led development is at the centre of local policies and regional growth strategies in that it reduces the impacts of rapid urbanisation on environment and society. Therefore, planners and policy makers often seek to optimise benefits of urban green spaces through developing programmes and strategies for the green amenity-oriented development in different urban areas and regions. Land suitability analysis is a widely utilised methodology that can help to establish strategies for the development of urban green land. This paper follows an integrated approach for the suitability analysis of urban green land development through integrating fuzzy set model and analytical hierarchical process (AHP) with the GIS-based multi-criteria decision making process. Pendik district in Istanbul (Turkey) was selected for the case study. Geo-physical factors, accessibility, blue and green amenities, residential centres, agricultural suitability, and land use/cover of the study area were recognised as the key factors affecting urban green land suitability. The results showed that most of the sites fall within marginal and low suitability class. About 25 % of the area was low suitable for green land development and 9 % was highly suitable. Land in the southern part of Pendik had higher suitability while northern region resulted in lower suitability. With a better understanding of potential sites that are suitable for urban green development, this study is fruitful for optimising land use planning and decision support.

AB  - A major water governance concern is how to coordinate the complex relationships of the water, food, and energy sectors and the resulting economic, social, and environmental consequences. Focusing on the challenges in one sector (e.g. water shortage in the water sector) and making decisions without considering other sectors will not solve these problems; rather, it will create a new problem (the decline of food production) in the food sectors. The nexus approach is a novel method to represent the interrelated challenges of the water, food, and energy sectors by considering the sectors’ policies to achieve sustainable development. The present study analyzes the social network of nexus actors in the Yazd-Ardakan aquifer, Yazd province, Iran. For this purpose, 54 partners in the nexus network were first identified in various public, private, semi-private and non-governmental organizations. Three types of interactions (knowledge and information exchange, budget transfer, and collaboration) were analyzed among the actors. The actor-network was, then, assessed at the levels of the entire network and individual actors. Then, a coherence analysis was performed by the density index at the entire network level, and the power analysis was carried out using in-degree, out-degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality indices at the individual actor level. Social network analysis criteria were, then, incorporated with the multi-criteria decision-making model ELECTRE I to select the key and powerful actors in the nexus network. Next, the powerful actors were identified and introduced with respect to 15 criteria employed in the social network analysis. According to the results, the power structure in the nexus network of the research area is not at equilibrium. Most of the power lies with the public sector. The water, food, and energy sectors act alone and they do not exploit their maximum organizational capacities to establish relationships with one another.

AB  - Thin-walled tubes have been mostly used in passive vehicle safety systems as crash energy absorber. With the use of additive manufacturing technology, it is possible to produce novel filler materials to further enhance the crashworthiness performance of thin-walled tubes. In this study, optimal designs of novel lattice structure filled square thin-walled tubes are investigated under axial impact loading by using a compromise programming based multi-objective crashworthiness optimization procedure. Types of filler lattice structures (i.e., body-centered cubic, BCC and body-centered cubic with vertical strut, BCC-Z), diameter of lattice member, number of lattice unit cells and tube thickness are considered as design parameters, and the optimum values of these design parameters are sought for minimizing the peak crash force (PCF) and maximizing the specific energy absorption (SEA) values. The validated finite element models are utilized in order to construct the sample design space and carrying out results verification; an artificial neural network is employed for predicting values of the objective functions; the weighted superposition attraction algorithm is used to generate design alternatives and searching for their optimal combination. The compromise programming approach is used to combine multi-objectives and to produce various optimal design alternatives. The optimization results showed that the proposed approach is able to provide good solutions with high accuracy and proper selection of design parameters can effectively enhance the crashworthiness performance of the lattice structure filled thin-walled tubes. The optimum results revealed that BCC hybrid designs have generally superior crashworthiness performance compared to that of their BCC-Z counterparts for the same compromise solutions. In particular, the PCF value of the optimized BCC-Z hybrid structures is up to 44% higher than that of BCC hybrid structures while these structures have similar energy absorption performances. The compromise solutions also show that the SEA of BCC and BCC-Z hybrid structures increases respectively by 29% and 51% depending on the selected weight factors for the design objectives.

The decision-making methods were used to approximate investor behavior according to three functions, chosen to represent different investor profiles (conservative, moderate and aggressive). The proposed methods are compared with those found in the literature. Additionally, computational simulations are performed using assets from the Brazilian stock exchange for the period between January 2011 and December 2015. The strategy is that each beginning of the month: the previous portfolio is sold, the optimization is performed, and the decision-making method selects the new portfolio to be purchased. Results of the simulations consider monthly maximum drawdown and cumulative return during the entire study period and show that the optimization model is robust, considering the three simulated profiles. The methods always present cumulative returns above safe investments for the analyzed period, and the aggressive profile obtained bigger gains with greater risk.

AB  - This paper presents a novel Soft Computing Approach called “Neuro-Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (NFANP)” for the group decision-making problems based on the conventional Analytic Network Process (ANP) method. The proposed approach deals with the interval values of judgments in a fuzzy environment using mobile, not fixed, trapezoidal and triangular membership functions, as well as the interval numerical ratio defined by alpha-cuts and the decision maker’s confidence levels. The consistency problem of the fuzzy reciprocal matrices is addressed in the proposed paper by allowing a certain tolerance deviation to be less than 0.20. Furthermore, trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are included in the proposed approach to reduce the large number of computations of the arithmetic operations required to correlate decision factors with the alternatives. In the proposed implementation, the selection problem is defined into three main decision groups: Supplier Characteristics, On-Going Performance, and Project Management Capabilities. The supplier alternatives are classified by the decision makers corresponding to company size, quality system implementation, and cost management. The application of the proposed approach shows a great accuracy in the final utility values and a significant reduction in the calculation requirements.

AB  - Wetland area and depth of wetland in the moribund Ganges delta of India is simulated and predicted up to 2037. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) map from 1987 to 2017 is used for predicting the same. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based Cellular Automata (CA) simulation is used to predict wetland area and exponential adaptive smoothing and least square regression are used to predict wetland depth. The result shows 17–18% of wetland area may lose their existence in the upcoming two decades. Water depth of large wetlands area is likely to be reduced by 45–50% in both seasons and small fragmented marginal wetlands are going to be dried out in the next twenty years. Large wetland and wetland core area is safer than smaller and fringe wetland. Considering the socio-ecological importance policy should be taken and the result could help to define plan sustainably.

AB  - The interest to find cost-optimal zero-energy solutions for building, using multi-objective optimization, has risen dramatically over the last decade. Accordingly, several studies have been carried out, proposing new methods and tools. None, however, has introduced a simplified approach that is viable by a broader range of users. This study addresses this lack, offering a methodology that supports the decision making process on cost-optimal zero energy building, using a novel approach, namely Multi-Objective Parametric Analysis (MOPA), rather than optimization algorithms. This study adds to the domain of roof stacking construction by setting the weight of construction as a third objective. The current methodology is applied to a newly developed theoretical Reference Building (RB) for a Belgian passive roof stacking house. Different options of the building’s superstructure components (walls, roof, and windows) have been examined. MOPA follows three consecutive steps: modeling setup, parametric simulation, and ends up with evaluation and selection. The results show cost-optimal zero-energy and lightweight packages of design variables for the building envelope.

AB  - The survival of the manufacturing organizations has been challenged by global competition, dynamic customer requirements, and limited natural resources. Manufacturing organizations need to adopt innovative strategies to overcome such challenges. Lean Six Sigma is one of the key business strategies which has been employed by manufacturing organizations to improve their operational performance. The integration of Sustainability with Lean Six Sigma has created interest among the researchers and practitioners to improve sustainable performance. For any manufacturing organization, it is critical to identify the enablers for the successful Sustainable Lean Six Sigma implementation. The purpose of the present study is to identify and evaluate the enablers of Sustainable Lean Six Sigma. The enablers of Sustainable Lean Six Sigma in Indian manufacturing organizations have not been explored in past studies, which motivates the present case study. The enablers for Sustainable Lean Six Sigma implementation were identified through the combined approach of literature review and experts’ opinions. Fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory technique was applied to evaluate the enablers for Sustainable Lean Six Sigma implementation in an electric component manufacturing organization. The relationships among the prominent cause enablers and effect enablers are established through the causal diagram. The top management commitment and involvement was found as the most significant enabler, followed by organizational readiness to implement Sustainable Lean Six Sigma, environmental management system. The present study is one of the initial studies to evaluate integrated (Sustainability and Lean Six Sigma) enablers for Sustainable Lean Six Sigma implementation. The results of the present study will assist the researchers and practitioners in implementing Sustainable Lean Six Sigma in manufacturing organizations by understanding the mutual relationships among the enablers.

AB  - In today's dynamic business environment, agile supply chain (ASC) has become a key strategic move to cope with market instability, handle competitive pressures and strengthen operational and organizational performance. Meanwhile ASC is a good example of a strategy drawing heavily on digitization since as a demand chain management it was information-centric and technology-centric from its inception. Yet, despite this relationship, a lack of coherence and clarity around the input of technology for ASC has impeded to portray accurately the relative importance of digitization in ASC strategies. This study provides a comprehensive and integrative review of 90 articles on ASC. By so doing, we contribute to the discussion about digitization in the supply chain in several ways. First, the paper reports descriptively and analytically how technology was addressed within the ASC literature. Second, it maps a nomological network of ASC research. Third, it finds that technology appears as a necessary but not-sufficient enabling factor for ASC deployment. Finally, a research agenda is proposed to suggest future research avenues to improve contributions to ASC performance.

AB  - Estimation and mapping of wetland methane (CH4) emission is carried out from the wetlands of mature Ganges deltaic environment of India. Wetlands are firstly demarcated into six types and CH4 emission is estimated for each wetland types during pre and post-monsoon seasons in order to assess seasonality effects on methanogenesis across wetland habitat types. Water Richness (WR) of the wetlands area was also assessed using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to investigate its effect on CH4 emission. Results show significant variation of wetland CH4 emission influenced by WR and seasonality. Very high WR zone is found over almost 18% wetland area where average monthly emission is <0.5 ton/km2. This rate is much lower than the average monthly emission of very low WR zone (>3.0 ton/km2) covering more than 35% of the wetland area. Average monthly emission during pre-monsoon season is about 0.18 ton/km2 and which decreases to 0.15 ton/km2 during post-monsoon season. Considerable seasonal wetland areas make greater total CH4 emission during post-monsoon month than pre-monsoon. Highest average monthly emission rate is found over lakes which is 1.73 ton/km2 during pre-monsoon and reduces to 0.54 ton/km2 during post-monsoon followed by marshy wetlands. The bheries (local name of embanked wetland diurnally controlled by tidal water mainly used for pisciculture) show the lowest emission rate which is not more than 0.08 ton/km2.

AB  - This research examines the demand-dependent product recovery decision-making problem for a batch of products that undergo remanufacturing/dismantling via a hybrid recovery system. Product recovery provides an attractive approach to achieving sustainable manufacturing. Faced with changing demand, flexible recovery decisions on product recovery strategies, component recovery options, and recovery yields are critical to enable a successful and sustainable operations. However, a need exists for an integrated model to provide a comprehensive optimal solution from the integrated perspective of economic, environmental, and societal sustainability. This research gap is addressed by proposing and validating a multi-objective decision-making model. Demand-dependent optimal solutions are identified that balance different sustainable performance constraints. Further, a two-stage meta-heuristic method is developed to solve the model, where a cooperative evolution mechanism is designed to optimize dismantling decisions and recovery yields simultaneously. Numerical experiments are conducted that illustrate and validate the developed solution. In addition, the impacts of demand on optimal decisions and different sustainable performance are investigated. The results verify the effectiveness of our new model and approach in assisting decision makers in finding a flexible path to sustainable recovery while providing insights into analyzing the counteraction effect of different demands in hybrid recovery implementation.

Generally, conventional supervised methods are not able to produce desired classification accuracy due to inadequate training samples present in gene expression data to train the system. Ensemble-based active learning technique in this situation can be effective as it determines few informative samples by all the base classifiers and ensemble the decisions of all the base classifiers to get the most informative samples. Most informative samples are labeled by the subject experts and those are added to the training set, which can improve the classification accuracy. Method: We propose a novel ensemble-based active learning using fuzzy-rough approach for cancer sample classification from microarray gene expression data. The proposed method is able to deal with the uncertainty, overlap and indiscernibility usually present in the subtype classes of the gene expression data and can improve the accuracy of the individual base classifier in presence of limited training samples. Results: The proposed method is validated using eight microarray gene expression datasets. The performance of the proposed method in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1-measures and kappa is compared with six other methods. The improvements in accuracy achieved by the proposed method compared to its nearest competitive methods are 2.96%, 9.34%, 0.93%, 3.69%, 7.2% and 4.53% respectively for Colon cancer, Prostate cancer, SRBCT, Ovarian cancer, DLBCL and Central nervous system datasets. Results of the paired t-test justify the statistical relevance of the results in favor of the proposed method for most of the datasets. Conclusion: The proposed method is an effective general purpose ensemble-based active learning adopting the fuzzy-rough concept and therefore can be applied for other classification problem in future.

AB  - Condorcet consistent rules were originally developed for preference aggregation in the theory of social choice. Nowadays these rules are applied in a variety of fields such as discrete multi-criteria analysis, defence and security decision support, composite indicators, machine learning, artificial intelligence, queries in databases or internet multiple search engines and theoretical computer science. The cycle issue, known also as Condorcet's paradox, is the most serious problem inherent in this type of rules. Solutions for dealing with the cycle issue properly already exist in the literature; the most important one being the identification of the median ranking, often called the Kemeny ranking. Unfortunately its identification is a NP-hard problem. This article has three main objectives: (1) to clarify that the Kemeny median order has to be framed in the context of Condorcet consistent rules; this is important since in the current practice sometimes even the Borda count is used as a proxy for the Kemeny ranking. (2) To present a new exact algorithm, this identifies the Kemeny median ranking by providing a searching time guarantee. (3) To present a new heuristic algorithm identifying the Kemeny median ranking with an optimal trade-off between convergence and approximation.

AB  - Congestion is one of the pervasive issues for Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs) because of its bounded resources with respect to data processing, storage, transmission capacity and most importantly energy supply. A multitude of survey operations have been carried out over the previous decade to investigate and address multiple congestion-oriented problems and issues that are still unresolved. Various review articles published in the literature concentrated mainly on classical techniques for congestion control such as traffic-based, resource-based, and hybrid techniques, etc. In this survey article, an attempt has been made to present a systematic review of recent efforts assisted at refining the congestion control methodologies in WSNs by considering classical approaches as well as soft computing based approaches. It is a practicable idea to take a holistic view and study both approaches together. Finally, this article discusses design difficulties, various optimization models and future directions for the mechanism of congestion control in the domain of wireless sensor networks.

AB  - Scheduling is a decision-making mechanism that allows resource sharing among several activities by determining their order of execution on the available resources. In the heterogeneous distributed systems, it is a great challenge to schedule concurrent workflows submitted by different users at different times. Scheduling with deadline and budget constraints are becoming an even more challenging issue for cloud systems due to the cloud dynamics such as on-demand provisioning, elasticity, abundant resource types, and various pricing schemes. A well-managed budget and deadline constraint scheduling is required to optimize the system performance and end-user satisfaction. Hence, improving system performance and optimizing multiple scheduling criteria at the same time is a big challenge. To address these issues, a novel multi-workflow scheduling algorithm based on the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach, TOPSIS (Technique of Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is presented. A weighted sum of run time, cost and data transfer time are used to determine the optimal resource among the available resources in accordance with the task requirements. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms such as Budget-Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (BHEFT), Budget and Deadline Constraint Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (BDHEFT) and Cloud-based Workflow Scheduling Algorithm (CWSA) algorithms based on budget constraint,deadline constraint, and resource utilization. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed T-BDMWS outperforms current state-of-the-art heuristics with the criteria of achieving the user-specified budget or deadline constraints and resource efficiency.

AB  - Post-truth is a term that describes a distorting phenomenon that aims to manipulate public opinion and behavior. One of its key engines is the spread of Fake News. Nowadays most news is rapidly disseminated in written language via digital media and social networks. Therefore, to detect fake news it is becoming increasingly necessary to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper presents a review of the application of AI to the complex task of automatically detecting fake news. The review begins with a definition and classification of fake news. Considering the complexity of the fake news detection task, a divide-and-conquer methodology was applied to identify a series of subtasks to tackle the problem from a computational perspective. As a result, the following subtasks were identified: deception detection; stance detection; controversy and polarization; automated fact checking; clickbait detection; and, credibility scores. From each subtask, a PRISMA compliant systematic review of the main studies was undertaken, searching Google Scholar. The various approaches and technologies are surveyed, as well as the resources and competitions that have been involved in resolving the different subtasks. The review concludes with a roadmap for addressing the future challenges that have emerged from the analysis of the state of the art, providing a rich source of potential work for the research community going forward.

AB  - The economic and population growth worldwide are moving once invisible resource, “groundwater” into the headlines. The importance of groundwater in India can be realised from the fact that the majority of the irrigated food production is dependent on it. In Haryana state of India, where the present study has been conducted, the groundwater draft is more (13.9 × 109 m3) against the net availability of recharge (10.3 × 109 m3). Therefore, in Panipat region of Yamuna sub basin an attempt has been made to evaluate the groundwater potential zones, so that the groundwater stress areas can be sustainably managed. The present research accentuated the expediency of geospatial technology and selection of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques to evaluate the groundwater potential of the study area. Two MCDM methods namely Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Catastrophe Theory (CT) for the weighted overlay were employed in combination with remote sensing and GIS techniques for the demarcation of groundwater potential zones of the region. These models were validated with a groundwater resource potential map i.e. validation map prepared using field data by classifying the output maps into four categories on the basis of quantiles. Both the models used for the identification of groundwater potential zones gave similar results in terms of areal extent whereas the spatial distribution of groundwater prospect of AHP and CT was significantly distinct and CT method yielded better results on validation. Further, sensitivity analysis was carried out to know the effect of weights assigned to the input indicators/variable in both the MCDM techniques.

AB  - The use of reclaimed water as an alternative non-potable source is an increasing practice worldwide, especially in areas where water scarcity is becoming more severe. As with other environmental applications, reuse planning commonly faces a problem related to the selection of the best scheme to be adopted. To address this issue, this paper proposes, based on a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach, the development of the Water Reuse Potential (WRP) index to indicate the potential for developing industrial and agricultural non-potable water reuse schemes. The study area selected was the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo (MRSP) in Brazil, a region that can be used as a model for most urban areas in the world. The model was built using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) applying technical, environmental, and socioeconomic criteria. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to verify the influence of criteria weights on the results. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used for data extraction and spatial allocation of the results. The study identified São Paulo (WRP ​= ​0.813), Suzano (0.363), Barueri (0.293), Mogi das Cruzes (0.282) and Guarulhos (0.252) as the municipalities with greater WRP. Considering that water reuse is not a common practice in many countries and that non-potable reuse may be a fundamental step for water sources diversification, the approach developed can be used as a planning tool to assess and classify any region according to its reuse potential, providing decision makers and planners with simple-understanding and versatile elements for prioritizing investments in further studies.

KW  - Matrix-based incremental algorithm
AB  - Feature selection can identify essential features and reduce the dimensionality of features, improving the classification ability of a learning model. In this study, we consider data with a preference-order relation, i.e., ordered data. In the big data era, ordered data contain noise and exhibit heterogeneous features (including numerical and categorical features) and dynamic characteristics (i.e., new objects are added and obsolete objects are removed with evolving time). The dominance-based neighborhood rough set (DNRS) considers the preference order relation of heterogeneous features and demonstrates fault tolerance; thus, it can be applied well to heterogeneous feature selection in ordered data. At present, DNRS-based heterogeneous feature selection methods are only used for static ordered data. For dynamic ordered data, existing heterogeneous feature selection approaches are highly time-consuming because they are required to recalculate knowledge from scratch when multiple objects vary. Motivated by this issue, we utilize a matrix-based method in this work to study incremental heterogeneous feature selection based on DNRS in dynamic ordered data. First, we define neighborhood dominance conditional entropy (NDCE) as the uncertainty measure and introduce a non-monotonic feature selection strategy based on this measure. Second, the neighborhood dominance relation matrix and its diagonal matrix are defined to calculate NDCE in matrix form. Third, the updating mechanisms of the diagonal matrix are studied when objects vary and used to update NDCE. Lastly, two incremental feature selection algorithms are proposed when multiple objects are added to or deleted from heterogeneous ordered data. Experiments are performed on public data sets. Experimental results verify that the proposed incremental algorithms are effective and efficient for updating feature subsets in dynamic heterogeneous ordered data.

In the first stage, candidate locations of dry ports are weighted based on their eigenvector centrality in the complex network of association rules mined from a large amount of international transaction data. In the second phrase, dry port locations and their service areas are optimized using the gravity-based community structure. The method is validated in a real case study which optimizes a large-scale dry port network in Mainland China in the context of the Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI). As a result, optimal dry port locations include key transportation hubs that closely reflect the real BRI development plan, hence, the proposed approach is validated.

AB  - Site suitability problems in renewable energy studies have taken a new turn since the advent of geographical information system (GIS). GIS has been used for site suitability analysis for renewable energy due to its prowess in processing and analyzing attributes with geospatial components. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tools are further used for criteria ranking in the order of influence on the study. Upon location of most appropriate sites, the need for intelligent resource forecast to aid in strategic and operational planning becomes necessary if viability of the investment will be enhanced and resource variability will be better understood. One of such intelligent models is the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and its variants. This study presents a mini-review of GIS-based MCDM facility location problems in wind and solar resource site suitability analysis and resource forecast using ANFIS-based models. Also,a framework for the integration of the two concepts in wind and solar energy studies was presented. Various MCDM techniques for decision making with their strengths and weaknesses were presented. Country specific studies that apply GIS-based method in site suitability were presented with the criteria considered. Similarly, country-specific studies in ANFIS-based resource forecasts for wind and solar energy were also presented. From our findings, there has been no technically valid range of values for spatial criteria in site suitability process for wind and solar resource exploration and the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) has been commonly used for criteria ranking, thus, leaving other MCDM techniques less explored. Also, hybrid ANFIS models are more effective compared to standalone ANFIS models in resource forecast, and ANFIS optimized with population-based models has been mostly used. Finally, we present a roadmap for integrating GIS-MCDM site suitability studies with ANFIS-based modeling for improved strategic and operational planning.

AB  - Aerodynamic shape optimization of horizontal axis wind turbines was performed to minimize the cost of energy. The optimum blade was obtained by modifying the blade section contours at selected blade radial stations. For the optimization, the design variables were defined as the coordinates of the blade section contours perpendicular to the chord. An aerodynamic performance database was constructed for those blade configurations defined by random combinations of design variables selected within a given range by Latin-Hypercube sampling. An artificial neural network was applied to derive the approximate functions between the design variables and the aerodynamic performance of the database. By utilizing the approximate functions, a genetic algorithm was adopted to search for an optimized blade. To construct the database, a CFD flow solver based on unstructured meshes was utilized. To consider the effects of aeroelastic deformation of the structurally flexible blades, a coupled CFD-CSD method was also adopted. The applications were made for the NREL phase VI and NREL 5 MW reference wind turbine rotor blades. After optimization, the cost of energy was reduced by 0.82% for the NREL phase VI rotor blade and one percent for the NREL 5 MW reference wind turbine blade, respectively.

KW  - Ensemble learning
KW  - Multi-objective optimization
KW  - Imbalanced data sets
AB  - Ensemble learning methods have already shown to be powerful techniques for creating classifiers. However, when dealing with real-world engineering problems, class imbalance is usually found. In such scenario, canonical machine learning algorithms may not present desirable solutions, and techniques for overcoming this problem must be used. In addition to using learning algorithms that alleviate the imbalance between classes, multi-objective optimization design (MOOD) approaches can be used to improve the prediction performance of ensembles of classifiers. This paper proposes a study of different MOOD approaches for ensemble learning. First, a taxonomy on multi-objective ensemble learning (MOEL) is proposed. In it, four types of existing approaches are defined: multi-objective ensemble member generation, multi-objective ensemble member selection, multi-objective ensemble member combination, and multi-objective ensemble member selection and combination. Additionally, new approaches can be derived by combining the previous ones, such as multi-objective ensemble member generation and selection, multi-objective ensemble member generation and combination and multi-objective ensemble member generation, selection and combination. With the given taxonomy, two experiments are conducted for comparing (1) the performance of the MOEL techniques for generating and aggregating base models on several imbalanced benchmark problems and (2) the performance of MOEL techniques against other machine learning techniques in a real-world imbalanced drinking-water quality anomaly detection problem. Finally, results indicate that MOOD is able to improve the predictive performance of existing ensemble learning techniques.

AB  - Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has attracted many investors and borrowers since 2005. This financial market helps investors and borrowers to invest in or get loans without a traditional financial intermediary. Investors in the P2P lending market are allowed to invest in multiple loans instead of financing one loan entirely, so investment decision-making in P2P lending can be challenging for lenders because they are not usually expert in loan investing. The goal of this paper is to propose a data-driven investment decision-making framework for this competitive market. We use the artificial neural network and logistic regression to estimate the return and the probability of default (PD) of each individual loan. The return variable is the internal rate of return (IRR). Moreover, we formulate the investment decision-making in P2P lending as a multi-objective portfolio optimization problem based on the mean-variance theory by the use of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA2). To validate the proposed model, we use a real-world dataset from one of the most popular P2P lending marketplaces. In addition, our model is compared with a single-objective model and a profit-based approach. Throughout the experiment, the empirical results reveal that our multi-objective model in comparison with the single-objective model can improve a lender's investment decision based on both objectives of investments. It means that while the return increases, the risk decreases, simultaneously. On the other hand, it is concluded that the profit scoring model leads to a more profitable investment but with a high level of risk. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is done to check the sensitivity of our model to the total investment amount.

AB  - Sustainability has become a key factor in recent years. Countless methods have been developed to assess sustainability, such as the case of the Life Cycle Sustainability Analysis (LCSA). Thus, this article aims to identify and map the application of LCSA in the main scientific databases, through a process of bibliometric and systematic literature review. Therefore, a bibliographic portfolio that represents the publications of the LCSA was selected based on selection criteria, after which the bibliometric and systematic analyses were performed. The bibliometric analysis identified the temporal distribution of publications, journals, authors, and countries that contribute to the context, as well as a studies’ keyword analysis. The systematic analysis was carried out by verifying the types of studies present in the bibliographic portfolio, the economic sectors and countries of applied studies localization, the indicators and methodologies used to evaluate each sustainability dimension, and the main methodologies for results final analyses were also verified. The selected bibliographic portfolio consisted of 105 publications, corresponding to the period 2008–2019. The results show that developed countries have a greater number of publications. However, China stands out with the highest number of publications. Most of the studies in the portfolio are developments of methodologies and applications in case studies. The applied studies covered several economic and global localization sectors. Moreover, it was found that there is a great variability of environmental, economic, and social indicators employed, as well as methodologies for analyzing the final results. For example, the main indicators were: eutrophication and acidification; electricity and operating and maintenance costs, and employment; and multi-criteria decision analysis (MDCA) was the most widely used methodology. This research makes several new contributions, providing academics and professionals with an overview of the application of LCSA, through scientific indexes and the main approaches of publications, as well as the perspectives of new research.

AB  - In recent years, Digital Technologies (DTs) are becoming an inseparable part of human lives. Thus, many scholars have conducted research to develop new tools and applications. Processing information, usually in the form of binary code, is the main task in DTs, which is happening through many devices, including computers, smartphones, robots, and applications. Surprisingly, the role of DTs has been highlighted in people’s life due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several different challenges to implement and intervene in DTs during the COVID-19 outbreak; therefore, the present study extended a new fuzzy approach under Hesitant Fuzzy Set (HFS) approach using Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method to evaluate and rank the critical challenges of DTs intervention to control the COVID-19 outbreak. In this regard, a comprehensive survey using literature and in-depth interviews have been carried out to identify the challenges under the SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) framework. Moreover, the SWARA procedure is applied to analyze and assess the challenges to DTs intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the WASPAS approach is utilized to rank the DTs under hesitant fuzzy sets. Further, to demonstrate the efficacy and practicability of the developed framework, an illustrative case study has been analyzed. The results of this study found that Health Information Systems (HIS) was ranked as the first factor among other factors followed by a lack of digital knowledge, digital stratification, economic interventions, lack of reliable data, and cost inefficiency In conclusion, to confirm the steadiness and strength of the proposed framework, the obtained outputs are compared with other methods.

AB  - Widespread detrimental and long-lasting droughts are having catastrophic impacts around the globe. Researchers, organizations, and policy makers need to work together to obtain precise information, enabling timely and accurate decision making to mitigate drought impacts. In this study, a spatial modeling approach based on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and several metaheuristic optimizations (ANFIS-BA, ANFIS-GA, ANFIS-ICA, ANFIS-PSO) was developed to predict the spatial occurrence of drought in a region in southeastern Queensland, Australia. In this approach, data describing the distribution of eight drought-contributing factors were prepared for input into the models to serve as independent variables. Relative departures of rainfall (RDR) and relative departures of soil moisture (RDSM) were analyzed to identify locations where drought conditions have occurred. The set of locations in the study area identified as having experienced drought conditions was randomly divided into two groups, 70% were used for training and 30% for validation. The models employed these data to generate maps that predict the locations that would be expected to experience drought. The prediction accuracy of the model-produced drought maps was scrutinized with two evaluation metrics: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results demonstrate that the hybridized models (ANFIS-BA (AUCmean = 83.7%, RMSEmean = 0.236), ANFIS-GA (AUCmean = 81.62%, RMSEmean = 0.247), ANFIS-ICA (AUCmean = 82.12%, RMSEmean = 0.247), and ANFIS-PSO (AUCmean = 81.42%, RMSEmean = 0.255)) yield better predictive performance than the standalone ANFIS model (AUCmean = 71.8%, RMSEmean = 0.344). Furthermore, sensitivity analyses indicated that plant-available water capacity, the percentage of soil comprised of sand, and mean annual precipitation were the most important predictors of drought hazard. The versatility of the new approach for spatial drought modeling and the capacity of ANFIS model hybridization to improve model performance suggests great potential to assist decision makers in their formulations of drought risk, recovery, and response management, and in the development of contingency plans.

AB  - Progressive environmental and climate change have altogether expanded hydro-meteorological hazards everywhere throughout the world. In recent times, floods have gained increasing global significance as a result of their destructive nature and for causing monetary and human losses. Hitherto, flood mapping studies in India have been profoundly constrained because of the absence of a comprehensive database coordinating flood attributes, for example, peak discharge at river gauges or geospatial data. The present investigation, for the first time, applies a large number of multi-sourced environmental flood conditioning factors (viz. elevation, slope, distance from drainage, drainage density, flow accumulation, topographic wetness index, rainfall, land use, soil texture, topographic ruggedness index and geology) and socio-economic parameters (viz. population density, literacy rate, literate population density, and road density) using the analytical hierarchy process approach to prepare flood susceptibility, vulnerability, and flood risk maps of the entire Western Ghat coastal belt, India. Essential findings of this study demonstrate that a critical percentage of area is involving high (28%) and very high (22%) flood susceptibility. About 25% area shows high flood risk and these regions need immediate attention. Efficiency testing of the flood susceptibility map indicates high precision, utilizing area under the curve (AUC) through a considerably high value (0.84). The output flood risk map can be useful for planners, managers, and regulatory bodies to manage and mitigate flood incidents along the Western Ghat rivers. Even though the methodology applied in this study is highly simple, yet it shows high accuracy, and subsequently, can be utilized in other regions for expert knowledge-based flood mapping.

AB  - Customer-involved design concept evaluation (DCE) allows customers to take part in evaluating the design alternatives to get more popular design concept. Traditional customer-involved DCE methods still focus on the collection of customer responses and only consider cost and benefit characteristics of design criteria in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) based evaluation process. Few studies have customized the decision-making algorithms specifically aimed at customers’ preferences. This paper further explores the customers’ influences in the early stages of the product design development, and proposes a new rough number based MCDM model (i.e., VIKOR) incorporating customers’ preferences for design specifications along with designers’ perceptions for the characteristics of design criteria (cost and benefit) to perform concept evaluation under subjective environment, and this proposed method is named as integrated rough VIKOR (IR-VIKOR). The objective of this study is to identify the best design concept which maximizes the satisfactions of expectations from most customers as well as conforms to the characteristics of design criteria. Firstly, Shannon entropy is used to obtain the weightings and relative importance ratings of design criteria from the customers’ preferences. Secondly, the customers’ preferences for design attribute values, the importance ratings of design criteria and the characteristics of design criteria are combined together to define the ideal solutions to calculate the rough evaluation index of each design alternative in IR-VIKOR, and finally the ranking result is provided by IR-VIKOR to determine the best design concept. A practical design example is introduced to illustrate the evaluation process of this proposed method, and the empirical comparisons are further carried out to validate its superiority for DCE. Through the sensitivity analysis experiments including i) inside IR-VIKOR, and ii) between IR-VIKOR and other classical MCDM methods, the proposed method is proved to be a reliable and feasible customer-involved DCE approach.

AB  - In this discussion article, we try to highlight and discuss the wrong way for representing an areal phenomenon “flood” as a point vector format in GIS-based flood susceptibility studies and creating what is called “flood inventory map”. Two examples from the literature were taken to show that a flood event cannot be represented by point except with very small map scales (1: 10000000) and this flood event should be with other flood events to form the “flood inventory map”. With the help of the other two examples from the previous studies, this article showed the wrong used way for representing flood worldwide and suggested an appropriate method for mapping flood susceptibility.

AB  - In supply chain inventory management it is generally accepted that safety stocks are a suitable strategy to deal with demand and supply uncertainty aiming to prevent inventory stock-outs. Safety stocks have been the subject of intensive research, typically covering the problems of dimensioning, positioning, managing and placement. Here, we narrow the scope of the discussion to the safety stock dimensioning problem, consisting in determining the proper safety stock level for each product. This paper reports the results of a recent in-depth systematic literature review (SLR) of operations research (OR) models and methods for dimensioning safety stocks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of the application of OR-based approaches to investigate this problem. A set of 95 papers published from 1977 to 2019 has been reviewed to identify the type of model being employed, as well as the modeling techniques and main performance criteria used. At the end, we highlight current literature gaps and discuss potential research directions and trends that may help to guide researchers and practitioners interested in the development of new OR-based approaches for safety stock determination.

AB  - Companies with a high-performing supply chain (SC) often exhibit superior business performance. Therefore, companies are increasingly aligning their supply chain with business goals due to their impact on the firm's performance. Researchers acknowledge the importance of managing supply chain performance (SCP) in achieving greater customer experience and retention, increased cost-competitiveness, gaining market share with faster product innovation. Hence measuring and managing SCP is critical for a firm's business success. Though existing literature has explored key performance indicators (KPI) in measuring SCP but has rarely studied the interactions among the key SCP metrics and subsequent impact of overall SCP. To address the gap, present research work aimed to identify key metrics, rank them, investigate mutual relationship and propose integrated SCP metrics. Understanding the interrelationship among SCP metrics will enable supply chain practitioners in well-aligned decision making. To achieve this, a hybrid exploratory three-phased multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model is adopted. The qualitative Delphi technique is initially applied to identify the critical SCP metrics, followed by Best-Worst Method (BWM) to rank SCP metrics, completed by decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to establish the mutual relationship among the SCP metrics. The research finding, based on the study conducted for mining and earth-moving machinery manufacturing industry, suggests that sub-metrics such as flexibility in meeting customer needs, customer perceived value, operating cost of SC, employee productivity, range of products and services, are significantly contributing to the overall SCP. This study has proposed SCP metric selection model highlighting cross-functional and inter-organizational importance in performance management.

AB  - Miscanthus has been used to breed a variety of energy crops suitable for cultivation in various adverse environments. The collection, conservation, characterization and maintenance of Miscanthus genetic resources are the basic premises for improving Miscanthus crop varieties and their utilization. Large datasets will be generated at the same time. A system designed to manage and analyse those large datasets of Miscanthus germplasms in a coherent and systematic manner is urgently needed. In the present study, the Miscanthus Germplasm Database (MGDB) is constructed to rationalize the storage, update, query and analysis of Miscanthus germplasm data for a multiuser environment. A multi-criteria decision-making model has been introduced into the MGDB to help evaluate Miscanthus and screen elite germplasm. Four hundred eighty-five representative materials of Miscanthus were evaluated and the results are described below. 1. Assessment of the energy potential: Miscanthus lutarioriparius (particularly accession A0118) and Miscanthus floridulus (particularly accession C0540) are the best species to use for combustion for power generation (CPG)/pyrolysis for bio-oil production (PBP) and fermentation for ethanol production (FEP)/fermentation for biogas production (FBP), respectively. 2. Assessment of the breeding potential: The optimal crossing combination is M. lutarioriparius and M. floridulus because of the parental advantages and complementarity. The C0602/C0540 accessions (M. floridulus) represent a suitable parent together with A0118 to breed new varieties for CPG and PBP; A0118 represents as an alternative parent for breeding to improve C0540 for use in FEP and FBP. 3. Prediction of the species distribution: The elite germplasm resources of M. floridulus are mainly distributed in ten floristic regions: IIID9a, IIID9b, IIID9c, IIID9d, IIID10c, IIID11a, IIID11b, IIID11c, IIID11d and IIID12a. The elite germplasm resources of M. lutarioriparius are mainly distributed in four floristic regions: IIID9a, IIID9b, IIID9d and IIID10c.

AB  - The municipal drainage system is a key component of every modern city's infrastructure. However, as the drainage system ages its pipes gradually deteriorate at rates that vary based on the conditions of utilisation (i.e., intrinsic conditions) and other extrinsic factors such as the presence of trees with deep roots or the traffic load above the sewer lines, which collectively can impact the structural integrity of the pipes. As a result, regular monitoring of the drainage system is extremely important since replacement is not only costly, but, more importantly, can disturb the daily routines of citizens. In this respect, closed-circuit television (CCTV) inspection has been widely accepted as an effective inspection technology for buried infrastructure. Since sewer pipes can run for thousands of kilometers underground, cities collect massive amounts of CCTV video footage, the assessment of which is time-consuming and may require a large team of trained technologists. A framework is proposed to realize the development of a real-time automated defect detection system that takes advantage of a deep-learning algorithm. The framework focuses on streamlining the information and data flow, proposing patterns of input and output data processing. With the development of deep learning techniques, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) based object detector, namely YOLOv3 network, has been employed in this research. This algorithm is known to be very efficient in the field of object detection from the perspective of processing speed and accuracy. The model used in this research has been trained with a data set of 4056 samples that contains six types of defects (i.e., broken, hole, deposits, crack, fracture, and root) and one type of construction feature (tap). The performance of the model is validated with a mean average precision (mAP) of 85.37%. The proposed output of the system includes labeled CCTV videos, frames that contain defects, and associated defect information. The labeled video can serve as the benchmark for assessment technologists while the multiple output frames provide an overview of the condition of the sewer pipe.

Subsequently, we design a rating scheme based on a multi-criteria decision-making method in a finite fuzzy covering approximation space. The rating scheme is implemented based on the preset subjective ratio and the calculated objective ranking of all alternatives. Furthermore, we use the relevant data of some customers of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) to illustrate the feasibility of our method. At the same time, two test rules are used to verify the validity of the proposed method. Moreover, we compare five different decision-making methods with our method to demonstrate the superiority of our method. Finally, the performance of our method is verified from the perspectives of the best alternative and the optimal ranking.

AB  - Cloud computing is a new distributed environment to provide on-demand services through the internet and has become popular due to this specific feature. By increasing the count of user requests and different criteria in applying the cloud resources, there exist challenges for managing these requests and their optimal allocation. Some of these challenges consist of considering the dynamic nature of the cloud environment, finding the values of the different criteria and the scheduling tasks by considering the user’s Quality of Service (QoS) preferences, load balancing, etc. Static load balancers distribute requests based on pre-known server capability ratios and these models do not produce optimal throughput when the server capabilities change overtime. None of the other scheduling algorithms is able to provide an adaptive approach to consider both of the load balancing and optimizing the QoS requirements. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new adaptive approach based on a combination of the concept of the best-worst multi criteria decision-making method (BWM), and compromise ranking method (VIKOR). The VIKOR method is implemented as a decision maker to specify the task priorities. The proposed approach is validated with numerical experiments and is compared with the existing scheduling algorithms over different performance metrics. The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach improves the performance metrics like throughput, makespan, waiting time, virtual machine (VM) utilization and VM usage cost for all considered experimental scenarios in comparison with its counterparts.

AB  - Optimization is more and more significant due to its application in the real engineering problems. The recently proposed imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) is a successful method in mono-objective optimization. Nevertheless, ICA cannot handle simultaneously the conflicting objectives in multi-objective design problem. In addition, the ICA has the drawback of trapping in local optimum solutions when used for high-dimensional or complex multimodal functions. In order to deal with these situations, in this work, an improved ICA, named modified multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm (MOMICA) is proposed. In MOMICA, an attraction and repulsion (AR) concept is implemented in the assimilation phase to improve the performances of the algorithm to reach the global optimal position. Moreover, in contrast to ICA, the proposed algorithm integrates the sorting non-dominated strategy (SND) to store the Pareto optimal solutions of multiple conflicting functions. Three performance metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm: (a) convergence to the true Pareto-optimal set, (b) solutions diversity and (c) robustness, characterized by the variance over 10 runs. The results presented in this paper show that the MOMICA algorithm outperforms the other popular techniques in terms of convergence characteristics and global search ability, for both benchmark functions optimization and multi-objective engineering optimization problems.

AB  - This paper outlines a framework in order to provide a reliable and up-to date local precipitation dataset over Sistan and Baluchestan province, one of the poorly rain gauged areas in Iran. Initially, the accuracy of GPCC data, as the reference dataset, was evaluated. Next, the performance of eight gridded precipitation products (namely, CHIRPS, CMORPH-RAW, ERA5, ERA-Interim, GPM-IMERG, GSMaP-MVK, PERSIANN and TRMM3B42) were compared based on the GPCC observations during 1982–2016 over the study area. The evaluation was done by using eight commonly used statistical and categorical metrics. Then, among the products, the most suitable ones on the basis of their better performance and least time delay in providing data, were utilized as the constituent members of the proposed hybrid dataset. Using several statistical/machine learning approaches (namely, NSGA II, ETROPY and TOPSIS), daily weights of the chosen datasets were estimated, while the correlation coefficient and the estimation error of the data were maximized and minimized, respectively. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed hybrid precipitation dataset was investigated. Results indicate that the developed hybrid dataset (2014-present), using the estimates of the chosen ensemble members (GPM-IMERG, GSMaP-MVK and PERSIANN) and their respective weighting coefficients, provides accurate local daily precipitation data with a spatial resolution of 0.25°, representing the minimum time delay, compared to the other available datasets.

AB  - Resource recovery and emissions from sanitation systems are critical sustainability indicators for strategic urban sanitation planning. In this context, sanitation systems are the most often structured using technology-driven templates rather than performance-based sustainability indicators. In this work, we answer two questions: Firstly, can we estimate generic resource recovery and loss potentials and their uncertainties for a diverse and large set of sanitation systems? And secondly, can we identify technological aspects of sanitation systems that indicate a better overall resource recovery performance? The aim is to obtain information that can be used as an input into any strategic planning process and to help shape technology development and system design for resource recovery in the future. Starting from 41 technologies, which include novel and conventional options, we build 101,548 valid sanitation system configurations. For each system configuration we quantify phosphorus, nitrogen, total solids, and water flows and use that to calculate recovery potentials and losses to the environment, i.e. the soil, air, or surface water. The four substances cover different properties and serve as a proxy for nutrient, organics, energy, and water resources. For modelling the flows ex-ante, we use a novel approach to consider a large range of international literature and expert data considering uncertainties. Thus all results are generic and can therefore be used as input into any strategic planning process or to help guide future technology development. A detailed analysis of the results allows us to identify factors that influence recovery and losses. These factors include the type of source, the length of systems, and the level of containment in storage and treatment. The factors influencing recovery are related to interactions of different technologies in a system which shows the relevance of a modelling approach that allows to look at all possible system configurations systematically. Based on our analysis, we developed five recommendations for the optimization of resource recovery: (i) prioritize short systems that close the loop at the lowest possible level; (ii) separate waste streams as much as possible, because this allows for higher recovery potentials; (iii) use storage and treatment technologies that contain the products as much as possible, avoid leaching technologies (e.g. single pits) and technologies with high risk of volatilization (e.g. drying beds); (iv) design sinks to optimise recovery and avoid disposal sinks; and (v) combine various reuse options for different side streams (e.g. urine diversion systems that combine reuse of urine and production of biofuel from faeces).

AB  - Human factors contribute to majority of maritime accidents. This study proposes an advanced methodology for maritime accident prevention strategy formulation from a human factor perspective. It is conducted by incorporating Bayesian network (BN) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) in a multi-criteria decision-making system. In order to develop rational accident prevention strategies, this work integrates Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA), Hierarchical Clustering (HC) and Classification Tree (CT) to generate strategies and describes accident types as criteria for a new multi-criteria risk-based decision-making system. Specifically, MCA is performed to detect patterns of contributory factors explaining maritime accident types. It is complemented by HC and a CT, aiming at creating different classes of vessels. Next, a Bayesian-based TOPSIS model is built to illustrate the features of multiple criteria and the relations among alternatives (i.e. strategies), so as to select the best-fit strategies for accident prevention. The results show that the information, clear order, and safety culture are the three most effective recommendations for maritime accident prevention considering human errors, which presents new insights for accident prevention practice for maritime authorities.

AB  - Bank failure prediction models usually combine financial attributes through binary classification approaches. In this study we extend this standard framework in three main directions. First, we explore the predictive power of attributes that describe the diversification of banking operations. Second, we consider the prediction of failure in a multi-period context. Finally, an enhanced ordinal classification framework is introduced, which considers multiple instances of failed banks prior to failure (up to three years prior to bankruptcy). Various ordinal models are developed using techniques from multiple criteria decision analysis, statistics, and machine learning. Moreover, ensemble models based on error-correcting output codes are examined. The analysis is based on a sample consisting of approximately 60,000 observations for banks in the United States over the period 2006–2015. The results show that diversification attributes improve the predictive power of bank failure prediction models, mainly for mid to long-term prediction horizons. Moreover, ordinal classification models provide a better description of the state of the banks prior to failure and are competitive to standard binary classification models.

AB  - The ever-increasing amount of biomedical data is enabling new large-scale studies, even though ad hoc computational solutions are required. The most recent Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been achieving outstanding performance and an important impact in clinical research, aiming at precision medicine, as well as improving healthcare workflows. However, the inherent heterogeneity and uncertainty in the healthcare information sources pose new compelling challenges for clinicians in their decision-making tasks. Only the proper combination of AI and human intelligence capabilities, by explicitly taking into account effective and safe interaction paradigms, can permit the delivery of care that outperforms what either can do separately. Therefore, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) plays a crucial role in the design of software oriented to decision-making in medicine. In this work, we systematically review and discuss several research fields strictly linked to HCI and clinical decision-making, by subdividing the articles into six themes, namely: Interfaces, Visualization, Electronic Health Records, Devices, Usability, and Clinical Decision Support Systems. However, these articles typically present overlaps among the themes, revealing that HCI inter-connects multiple topics. With the goal of focusing on HCI and design aspects, the articles under consideration were grouped into four clusters. The advances in AI can effectively support the physicians’ cognitive processes, which certainly play a central role in decision-making tasks because the human mental behavior cannot be completely emulated and captured; the human mind might solve a complex problem even without a statistically significant amount of data by relying upon domain knowledge. For this reason, technology must focus on interactive solutions for supporting the physicians effectively in their daily activities, by exploiting their unique knowledge and evidence-based reasoning, as well as improving the various aspects highlighted in this review.

AB  - Complex systems constitute components that interact with one another and involve phenomena which are not always easy to understand in terms of their components and interactions. Alternative mathematical models have been developed so that the users’ tasks can be facilitated and an actual assistance can be provided for decision-making processes in case of every encountered incident which requires critical decision-making. Within this framework, financial systems can be regarded as complex systems with their volatile and vulnerable nature along with various parameters and interactions involved. Forecasting shifts in stock indices is crucial to validate the potential strategies of monetary mechanisms. Therefore, forecasting is an essential step in financial decision-making to manage data selection and attain robust prediction. Our purpose is to optimize the stock indices’ forecasting model in the stock indices dataset, constructed from the daily values. The following steps were applied to demonstrate the critical significance of Hurst exponent (HE) computed by Rescaled Range (R/S) fractal analysis when used as indicator in conjunction with Shannon entropy (SE) and Renyi entropy (RE) for the future forecasting ability of the stock indices. With this aim, the following stages were performed with indicators obtained from the applications and added into the dataset in the respective order. The first stage consists of: i) HE indicator, ii) Entropy based SE and RE indicators, iii) HE, SE and RE indicators. As the second stage, stock indices day-to-day valuation was evaluated using Multi Layer Regression (MLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Feed Forward Back Propagation (FFBP) algorithms, applied for each indicator for comparative analysis. When compared with earlier works, no relevant work exists in the literature in which the algorithms and above-mentioned indicators have been used in conjunction with one another. This paper, through the multistage methodology and proposed model, demonstrates that HE is obviously a significant and critical determining indicator compared to RE and SE indicators for forecasting purposes. Consequently, experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of the proposed method. Thus, this study attempts to illustrate a new frontier in domains concerning critical decision-making processes in non-linear, dynamic, and volatile environments.

AB  - Unplanned groundwater exploitation in coastal aquifers results in water decline and consequently triggers saltwater intrusion (SWI). This study formulates a novel modeling strategy based on GALDIT method using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for mapping the vulnerability to SWI. This AI-based modeling strategy is a two-level learning process, where vulnerability to SWI at Level 1 can be predicted by such models as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Sugeno Fuzzy Logic (SFL), and Neuro-Fuzzy (NF); and their outputs serve as the input to the model at Level 2, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). This model is applied to Urmia aquifer, west coast of Lake Urmia, where both are currently declining. The construction of the above four models both at Levels 1 and 2 provide tools for mapping the SWI vulnerability of the study area. Model performances in the paper are studied using RMSE and R2 metrics, where the models at Level 1 are found to be fit-for-purpose and the SVM at Level 2 is improved particularly with respect to the reduced scale of scatters in the results. Evaluating the result and groundwater samples by Piper diagram confirms the correspondence of SWI status with vulnerability index.

AB  - Previous studies on bikeability/cycling index have explored factors that influence cycling in cities, and developed indicators to characterize a bicycle-friendly environment. However, despite its strong influence on cycling behavior, cyclists’ exposure to traffic-related air pollution has been often disregarded. To close this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive bikeability index that comprises four sub-indices: accessibility, suitability, perceptibility, and prevailing air quality in the vicinity of cycling routes. We evaluate cyclists’ exposure to fine particulate matter and black carbon, and used open-source data, land-use regression models, deep neural networks and spatial analysis. The application of the proposed bikeability framework reveals that the inclusion of air quality makes a significant difference when calculating bikeability index in Singapore and hence it merits serious consideration. We believe that the newly developed framework will convince city planners to consider the importance of assessing cyclists’ exposure to airborne particles when planning cycling infrastructure.

AB  - Augmented globalizationand vertical integration have made contemporary supply chains an intricate network subject to a number of vulnerabilities. Preemptive measures are needed for dealing with mutable risks and vulnerabilities to safeguard robust supply chain systems. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) connotes a set of risk management responses essentially instigated to confront supply chain risks. As supply chain risks are intertwined, one resilient strategy for risk mitigation can moderate several supply chain risks. A complex decision making problem involving twelve major supply chain risks and twenty one resilient strategies for risk mitigation have been acknowledged in this research with archetypal focus on electronics manufacturing supply chains. A combination of Multi criteria decision aid (MCDA) and artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in decision making of complex real world problems. A decision support model incorporating an amalgamation of grey theory and layered analytic network process (ANP) has been employed for quantifying various resilient strategies for risk mitigation. The proposed model was also applied in a practical setting taking a case study of an electronics manufacturing company. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to ensure the robustness of obtained results. The combined methodology proposed in this research could be effectively used by top management, to pigeonhole the resilient supply chain strategies for better managing their supply chains.

This study utilizes a combined Delphi-AHP approach to identify potential candidate products that are outside of the scheme. Besides, implementing the traditional AHP method, this study employed an AHP-rating model to minimize computation time in the approach. The results of the study reveal that seven evaluation criteria are crucial for product selection. From 47 initially selected products, 22 products are identified as priority products. Sensitivity analysis was performed based on the different weighting of the evaluation criteria. Potential future activities that need to be performed by the policymakers on the issue are also discussed in the light of the circular economy and environmental protection. This study will also help academics performing the approach, and subsequently, the AHP rating model for selecting/prioritizing alternatives that focused on multi-criteria decision-making problems.

AB  - With advances in information and communication technologies (ICT), customers increasingly share their comments about electric vehicles (EVs) on various professional websites. By mining these consumer comments, decision makers (DMs) can analyze consumer preferences and evaluate the market acceptability of EVs to optimize the layout of EV products. Although the traditional multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method can provide relevant technical support, it is still challenged by two aspects in the context of big data: (1) DMs need to predefine the evaluated attributes and related weight parameters and (2) Various types of uncertain data need to be effectively processed in the evaluation process. To address these inadequacies, an improved stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis-evidential reasoning (SMAA-ER) approach is proposed to evaluate market acceptability for EVs. First, the (latent Dirichlet allocation) LDA topic model is used to analyze consumer reviews to help DMs define attributes and attribute weight constraints. Based on the collected attribute information, the acceptability index of each EV is calculated and a cross-ranking matrix formed. Then, a linear programming model is established to rank the market acceptability of EVs. Finally, a real case is used to demonstrate the detailed implementation process of our approach and reveal its potential applications in a big data environment.

AB  - Plastic forming is one of enabling and fundamental technologies in advanced manufacturing chains. Design optimization is a critical way to improve the performance of the forming system, exploit the advantages of high productivity, high product quality, low production cost and short time to market and develop precise, accurate, green, and intelligent (smart) plastic forming technology. However, plastic forming is quite complicated, relating to multi-physics field coupling, multi-factor influence, multi-defect constraint, and triple nonlinear, etc., and the design optimization for plastic forming involves multi-objective, multi-parameter, multi-constraint, nonlinear, high-dimensionality, non-continuity, time-varying, and uncertainty, etc. Therefore, how to achieve accurate and efficient design optimization of products, equipment, tools/dies, and processing as well as materials characterization has always been the research frontier and focus in the field of engineering and manufacturing. In recent years, with the rapid development of computing science, data science and internet of things (IoT), the theories and technologies of design optimization have attracted more and more attention, and developed rapidly in forming process. Accordingly, this paper first introduced the framework of design optimization for plastic forming. Then, focusing on the key problems of design optimization, such as numerical model and optimization algorithm, this paper summarized the research progress on the development and application of the theories and technologies about design optimization in forming process, including deterministic and uncertain optimization. Moreover, the applicability of various modeling methods and optimization algorithms was elaborated in solving the design optimization problems of plastic forming. Finally, considering the development trends of forming technology, this paper discusses some challenges of design optimization that may need to be solved and faced in forming process.

AB  - Since the early 1970s, mathematical models have been widely used at different spatial and temporal scales to gain insight into many diverse aspects of crop growth and development. However, these models were chiefly developed for main crop species and the application of modeling approaches for local crops has been overlooked. Undoubtedly mathematical models for underutilized crops such as saffron should be developed by scientists of the producing countries. Iran as the world’s first saffron producer plays a pioneering role in scientific research on this unique species and despite lack of soil, climatic and crop data, local attempts at development of mathematical models for saffron have been undertaken. This chapter provides an overview of these modeling efforts, starting with crop-weather models and artificial neural networks as the yield prediction tools followed by response surface modeling for optimization purposes, and dynamic models for simulation of saffron growth and development. Furthermore, some applications of the models at local and regional scales are discussed.

AB  - Background and Objective
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system for which currently there is no cure. Its treatment requires long-term, interdisciplinary disease management, and usage of typical medications, including levodopa, dopamine agonists, and enzymes, such as MAO-B inhibitors. The key goal of disease management is to prolong patients' independence and keep their quality of life. Due to the different combinations of motor and non-motor symptoms from which PD patients suffer, in addition to existing comorbidities, the change of medications and their combinations is difficult and patient-specific. To help physicians, we developed two decision support models for PD management, which suggest how to change the medication treatment.
Methods
The models were developed using DEX methodology, which integrates the qualitative multi-criteria decision modelling with rule-based expert systems. The two DEX models differ in the way the decision rules were defined. In the first model, the decision rules are based on the interviews with neurologists (DEX expert model), and in the second model, they are formed from a database of past medication change decisions (DEX data model). We assessed both models on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and on a questionnaire answered by 17 neurologists from 4 European countries using accuracy measure and the Jaccard index.
Results
Both models include 15 sub-models that address possible medication treatment changes based on the given patients' current state. In particular, the models incorporate current state changes in patients' motor symptoms (dyskinesia intensity, dyskinesia duration, OFF duration), mental problems (impulsivity, cognition, hallucinations and paranoia), epidemiologic data (patient's age, activity level) and comorbidities (cardiovascular problems, hypertension and low blood pressure). The highest accuracy of the developed sub-models for 15 medication treatment changes ranges from 69.31 to 99.06 %.
Conclusions
Results show that the DEX expert model is superior to the DEX data model. The results indicate that the constructed models are sufficiently adequate and thus fit for the purpose of making “second-opinion” suggestions to decision support users.

AB  - Location analysis for a consolidation facility is a multi-criteria challenge, compounded by spatial constraints in real-world scenarios such as those found in inner-city areas. However, most decision support models in location studies of consolidation facilities are limited to numerical computation or multi-criteria analysis while ignoring spatial factors in location selection. This study aims to characterise suitable locations for an inner-city consolidation facility based on spatial aspects, operational requirements, and societal concerns. Accordingly, this study presents an integrated spatial multi-criteria location framework to identify and rank optimal sites for a proposed freight consolidation facility in an inner-city area using 11 decision criteria identified from key stakeholders. Real geographic data from Inner Melbourne, Australia, are used to identify 20 candidate sites which are then evaluated and ranked using the TOPSIS method. The suitability analysis confirms that the most suitable locations are in zones with affordable industrial land with excellent accessibility to major roads and goods receivers. Sensitivity analysis indicates that assigning more significance to the operational requirements and decreasing the priority weight for proximity to residential areas tip favourability towards areas with low real estate costs and more industrially-zoned parts. The multi-criteria spatial modelling allows decision-makers and transport researchers to apply value-decisions at the onset of the process, and it also allows for improved understanding and visualisation of the results and of the significance of the chosen criteria in the evaluation process.

AB  - The optimization of a Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) core is a challenging process, due to the large number of design parameters, the nonlinearities among inputs and outputs, and the complicated correlation among output parameters. This study attempts to develop a generalized framework for the SFR core optimization by coupling the sensitivity analysis, advanced optimization algorithm, and optionally the surrogate modeling. The framework is built based on the fast reactor modeling capability of the Argonne Reactor Computation (ARC) suite and the sensitivity analysis and optimization modules embedded in the DAKOTA code, both have been integrated within the NEAMS Workbench. The genetic algorithm is selected as the optimization method for its robustness, while the option of surrogate modeling is also explored to alleviate the computational burden caused by employing the ARC direct core physics simulation and thus enhance the efficiency of the optimization. Finally, the normalized deviations of performance parameters of the near-optimal solution from those of the ideal core are calculated and used as criteria to down select the final core design. The developed framework is applied to the Advanced Burner Test Reactor (ABTR) core, and optimal solutions are determined by balancing various objectives simultaneously, including peak fast flux, core volume, power, reactivity swing, plutonium mass feed, while at the same time satisfying the predefined constraints due to safety or economics considerations. The optimal ABTR core design obtained using the direct physical simulation and surrogated model are compared and discussed. It is found that using the accurately constructed surrogate models can significantly reduce the required computational time while maintaining satisfactory accuracy.

The paper explains the integration of theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ), Morphological chart, and Analytic Network Process (ANP) method to ensure the quality function is fulfilled with the essential requirements. The objective of this project is to produce and choose the best design concept for the product development depending on the product design specifications (PDS). In the early stage of product development, the TRIZ contradiction principles and 40 TRIZ inventive solutions were applied as the guidance tools. To refine the specification of the product design, the principle solution parameters were detailed systematically with the aid of morphological chart. In this article, four innovative conceptual designs of the multi-operations creep flexural test rig were produced and the selection process was conducted using ANP method to perform the multi-criteria decision making process in selecting the best concept design.

Steam Rankine cycle (SRC), organic Rankine cycle (ORC), absorption chiller, Parabolic trough collectors (PTCs), geothermal well, proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, and reverse osmosis (RO) desalination are the main subsystems of the cycle. The amount of exergy destruction is calculated for each component after modeling and thermodynamic analysis. The PTCs, absorption chiller, and PEM electrolyzer had the highest exergy destruction, respectively. According to meteorological data, the system was annually and hourly tested for Dezful City. For instance, it had a production capacity of 13.25 kg/day of hydrogen and 147.42 m3/day of freshwater on 17th September. Five design parameters are considered for multi-objective optimization after investigating objective functions, including cost rate and exergy efficiency. Using a Group method of data handling (GMDH), a mathematical relation is obtained between the input and output of the system. Next, a multi-objective optimization algorithm, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), was used to optimize the relations. A Pareto frontier with a set of optimal points is obtained after the optimization. In the Pareto frontier, the best point is selected by the decision criterion of TOPSIS. At the TOPSIS point, the exergy efficiency is 31.66%, and the total unit cost rate is 21.9 $/GJ.

AB  - Smart product recovery decision-making (SRDM) plays a critical role in the closed-loop manufacturing chain. SRDM can facilitate the maximum reclamation of End-of-Life product value while achieving sustainability. Ubiquitous information and computational intelligence technologies empower the implementation of SRDM. These emerging smart technologies not only reduce the information uncertainties but also provide powerful operational methodologies for SRDM. However, there is a lack of a systematic and comprehensive framework to assist practitioners in better understanding SRDM in both theory and practice, as well as directing how to apply these emerging techniques to facilitate SRDM at the operational level. This study is the first effort to address this gap by providing a state-of-art review of SRDM techniques. First, the paper discusses the SRDM enablers and highlights their contributions. The SRDM enablers include the information technique, smart equipment, service platform and closed-loop supply chains. Then the SRDM techniques are reviewed in four aspects: model input prediction, recovery option determination, process planning, and production scheduling and planning. Further, a generalized SRDM implementation framework with a methodology roadmap is proposed to assist practitioners in applying the framework to practice. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in SRDM, inherited, derived, and enabled by the ubiquitous information and computational intelligence technologies, are identified and discussed. This study shows that the research on SRDM remains at an early stage. With the roadmap and insights provided in this work, more research can potentially advance SRDM.

AB  - Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) involve synergies between multiple energy storage technologies with complementary operating features aimed at enhancing the reliability of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES). Nevertheless, coordinating HESS through optimized energy management strategies (EMS) introduces complexity. The latter has been previously addressed by the authors through a systems-level graphical EMS via Power Pinch Analysis (PoPA). Although of proven efficiency, accounting for uncertainty with PoPA has been an issue, due to the assumption of a perfect day ahead (DA) generation and load profiles forecast. This paper proposes three adaptive PoPA-based EMS, aimed at negating load demand and RES stochastic variability. Each method has its own merits such as; reduced computational complexity and improved accuracy depending on the probability density function of uncertainty. The first and simplest adaptive scheme is based on a receding horizon model predictive control framework. The second employs a Kalman filter, whereas the third is based on a machine learning algorithm. The three methods are assessed on a real isolated HESS microgrid built in Greece. In validating the proposed methods against the DA PoPA, the proposed methods all performed better with regards to violation of the energy storage operating constraints and plummeting carbon emission footprint.

AB  - Snow avalanches can destroy lives and infrastructure and are very important phenomena in some regions of the world. This study maps snow avalanche susceptibility in Sirvan Watershed, Iran, using a new approach. Two statistical models – belief function (Bel) and probability density (PD) – are combined with two learning models – multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and logistic regression (LR) – to predict avalanche susceptibility using remote sensing data in a geographic information system (GIS). A snow avalanche inventory map was generated from Google Earth imagery, regional documentation, and field surveys. Of 101 avalanche locations, 71 (70%) were used to train the models and 30 (30%) were used to validate the resulting models. Fourteen snow avalanche conditioning factors were used as independent variables in the predictive modeling process. First, the weight of Bel and PD techniques were applied to each class of factors. Then, they were combined with two MLP and LR learning models for snow avalanche susceptibility mapping (SASM). The results were validated using positive predictive values, negative predictive values, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, root-mean-square error, and area-under-the-curve (AUC) values. Thus, the AUCs for the PD-LR, Bel-LR, Bel-MLP, and PD-MLP hybrid models are 0.941, 0.936, 0.931 and 0.924, respectively. Based on the validation results, the PD-LR hybrid model achieved the best accuracy among the models. This hybrid modeling approach can provide accurate and reliable evaluations of snow avalanche-prone areas for management and decision making.

KW  - Healthcare industry
KW  - MCDM
AB  - Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods are very useful tools for daily decision-making in different fields. In addition, determining an acceptable solution with respect to different factors is certainly a very demanding and difficult task. In this paper, a new Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution (MARCOS) method for a sustainable supplier selection in the healthcare industry (in a polyclinic) in Bosnia and Herzegovina is developed. The advantages of the developed method are: the consideration of an anti-ideal and ideal solution at the very beginning of the formation of an initial matrix, closer determination of utility degree in relation to both solutions, the proposal of a new way to determine utility functions and their aggregation, the possibility to consider a large set of criteria and alternatives while maintaining the stability of the method. Supplier selection is very important for organizations in the medical industry. Sustainability in the supplier selection process in the medical industry is a strategically important issue, and poorly implemented in the private medical sector. Therefore, the example explains how to use the MARCOS method to select sustainable suppliers in the private medical sector. A case study of a sustainable supplier selection for the healthcare industry (a polyclinic) includes ranking of eight alternatives with regard to 21 criteria for all aspects of sustainability. The results and verification of the new method are carried out throughout a comprehensive sensitivity analysis. 21 scenarios with changes in the weight values of criteria were established, the measurement scale from 1 to 9 was changed to 1–5, a comparison with six other MCDM methods was performed, and it was verified in dynamic conditions which implied a change of the elements of the initial decision-making matrix. All phases of the sensitivity analysis showed the validity of MARCOS method. The obtained results and all scenarios in sensitivity analysis show that A2 remains the best alternative.

AB  - The convergence of SMAC technologies resulted in an unexpected upsurge of web services on the internet. The flexibility and rental approach of the cloud makes it an attractive option for the deployment of web services-based applications. Once a number of web services are available to gratify the similar functionalities, then the choice of the web service based on personalized quality of service (QoS) parameters plays an important role in deciding the selection of the web service. The role of time is rarely being discussed in deciding the QoS of web services. The delivery of QoS is not made as declared due to the correlated behavior of non-functional performance of web services with the invocation time. This happens because service status usually changes over time. These limitations have affected the performance of neighborhood-based collaborative filtering. Hence, the design of the time aware web service recommendation system based on the personalized QoS parameters is very crucial and turn out to be a challenging research issue. In the current work, various econometric models are used for experimentation with the input time series to find the best fit model for the prediction of personalized QoS based web services recommendation. The Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) value is used as an evaluation metric and their value for the prediction of Response time is found to be 1.7392e+04 and 1.7416e+04 respectively with the ARMA model. The AIC and BIC value for throughput (TP) is found to be 1.5249e+04 and 1.5334e+04 respectively with the ARIMA. The value of variance is 13.2437 and 6.8131 for RT and TP respectively which is also the lowest among other models with t-statistic greater than the p-value. Thus, the experimental results show that the ARMA and ARIMA model of Time Series Forecasting for Web Services Recommendation Framework is performing better in case of Response time and throughput respectively.

AB  - The revolutionary development and implementation of smart technologies have triggered the manufacturers’ servitization trend towards smart product service system (PSS). Accurate selection of smart product service (SPS) module is critical to successful planning and development of smart PSS concept. This study constructs a list of criteria for SPS module selection from the perspectives of service implementation, value symbiosis and smart capability. The selection can be deemed as a multi-criteria decision-making process including two parts: weight determination of criteria and module ranking, in which the intrapersonal linguistic ambiguousness and interpersonal preference randomness are involved. The best–worst method (BWM) is widely acknowledged as an efficient method for weight determination due to its superiority in quickly finding optimal weight with scant decision data. The data envelopment analysis (DEA) method is proven feasible to prioritize alternatives with cost-based and benefit-based criteria. However, these two methods cannot handle the uncertainties involved in the selection process which may lead to imprecise results. Moreover, the previous research rarely studies simultaneous handling of these two types of uncertainty in the realm of BWM and DEA. Therefore, the current study proposes a novel rough–fuzzy BWM-DEA approach to SPS module selection, with fully capturing both the intrapersonal and interpersonal uncertainties. The application of the proposed approach in the smart vehicle service module selection and the comparisons with other methods demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - The notion of circular economy (CE) has gained considerable attention recently among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers due to the enormous waste generation at all phases of a product life cycle. CE acts as alternative solutions to the dominant linear economic model of production and consumption. The incorporation of the CE into supply chain management is known as circular supply chain management (CSCM). The objective of this study is to conduct a state-of-art review of CSCM using content analysis methodology. This review covers the available circular supply chain literature, highlights the research trends, gaps and set up the potential research directions for future studies. Total 125 CSCM articles published in journals covering the span of last one decade (2010 to July 2019) are selected. The CSCM research articles are evaluated and segregated in 13 pre-defined structural dimensions and analytics. The result shows that there exist ample scope and open doors for the growth of CSCM which should be investigated with the help of advanced quantitative modeling approaches, highly developed optimization techniques, integrated multi-criteria decision making techniques, and proficient algorithms. Also, CSCM research needs to recognize enablers/drivers/critical success factors, barriers/obstacles, new circular business models and innovative frameworks. Therefore, this examination will prop up new opportunities for researchers to figure out the novel dimensions in the field of CSCM.

AB  - Combining wind power with pumped-storage systems is trustworthy for reducing the unreliability of wind energy, caused by the variable nature of the wind for contributing to the grid's peak shaving. Locating suitable sites for constructing both wind parks and pumped-storage systems for peak shaving is a delicate problem-solving. For solving such problems, a wide range of technical, financial, and environmental criteria should be taken into account. A two-step decision framework combining GIS, Analytic Network Process (ANP) and fuzzy VIKOR are proposed in this paper to solve the problem for locating the suitable sites for constructing a wind-powered pump storage plant. In the first step, a GIS database is developed to locate a handful potential sites within the study area. As there are different and even conflicting criteria involved with site selection problem. In the second step, we used an MCDM approach of fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) and fuzzy VIKOR to rank these potential sites. To establish an evaluation system, four major clusters of criteria are introduced (wind farm, water reservoir, water pump and power production) with more addition related sub-criteria. Comprehensive guidelines are formulated through a hierarchical procedure so a data-driven, multi-aspect decision framework could be presented with the goal of improving the benefits of integrated renewable energies. The results show that, the Gilane-Gharb dam is the most promising site within the study area. This site provides a net area of 13.2 km2 for constructing a wind farm with an approximate power capacity of 31 MW. The proposed procedure in this is a framework that are provide a theoretical reference for resolving any multicriteria decision-making problem by introducing the appropriate criteria.

This paper contributes three things previously lacking in CEM literature: a systematic review and content analysis of published articles related to NFS topics in CEM research; identification of criteria to evaluate different NFS; and recommendations to researchers and industry practitioners in choosing a suitable subset of NFS techniques for solving different types of CEM problems. The literature review reveals that NFS classification methods are based on NFS architecture, learning algorithm, fuzzy method, and application area. This paper systematically categorizes CEM application domains (decision making, prediction/forecasting, evaluation/assessment, system modeling and analysis, simulation, and optimization) and maps them to NFS based on their suitability, which is determined using the performance evaluation criteria of convergence speed, computational complexity, interpretability, accuracy, and local minima trapping.

Here intuitionistic fuzzy logic helps in considering cognitive properties of attributes, so that the legitimate transactions are not treated as frauds and fraudulent transactions are not treated as legitimate. For optimality of detection process we have considered both the derived attributes and normal attributes. The result obtained here shows that detection rate is high and efficient, compared to the other recent works.

AB  - Assessment of ecosystem health (EH) in Indian megacities is urgently required where ineffective environmental protection policies turned them into hotspots of a bundle of eco-environmental problems. In this study, the classic Vigor-Organization-Resilience (VOR) framework was employed to devise the ecosystem health index (EHI) of Kolkata megacity which is similar to the work of Peng et. al. (2015). Results show that EH of this megacity city region was rapidly deteriorating trend, from 0.627 to 0.377 with strong spatial heterogeneity. In 2000, areal coverage of EH status of relatively well was 73.10% reduced to 52.00% and areal coverage of weak EH status increased to 21.80% in 2019. The relatively weak and weak status of EH are concentrated in Kolkata, Howrah and its adjacent areas. The study proposed a new improvement and deterioration index to track the changes of EH at the city scale to overcome the limitation of the percentage change method. Ultimately the outcome of the study provides a better understanding of EH in Kolkata megacity region that is helpful for policymakers in developing measures for eco-environmental management.

AB  - Active modes of transport i.e. cycling and walking leave positive and progressive impacts on health, environment, and society. Despite these positive impacts, the developing, as well as many developed economies of the world, sees limited use of active modes of transport. The limited use can be attributed to active transport, being influenced by various social, cultural, and behavioral traits. Through this research, the influence of various social, cultural, behavioral traits on cycling and walking is to be studied. The paper utilizes Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) for exploring the link between social, behavioral, cultural traits, and active transport in Pakistan. Findings of the research suggest that from considered social parameters, cycling and walking's image as a socially responsible investment and their role in health and safety influence the use of active transport. Exploiting these two social parameters, the use of cycling and walking can be increased. In addition, from amongst the behavioral parameters considered, economic trends and pace of life have the greatest influence on the adoption of active transport as the main mode of transport. Similarly, from considered cultural parameters, the distribution of masses in rural and urban areas, laws and policies, and spending trends motivate the most in shifting towards active modes of transport.

AB  - Evidently, online voice of customers (VoC) expressed in social media has emerged as quality data for researchers who are willing to conduct customer-driven business intelligence (BI) research. Nevertheless, to the best of authors’ knowledge, there is still a dearth of studies that deal with such remarkable research stream and address various open data (e.g., social media, intellectual property) from a BI research perspective. Therefore, this study has attempted to evaluate the applicability of social media data in BI research and provide a systematic review on the primary research articles in the domain. This study compared social media data with the other open data (e.g., gray literature, public government data) in terms of data content, collection, updatability and structure, which are determined through a thorough discussion with experts. Next, this study selected 57 social media-based BI research articles from the Web of Science (WoS) database and analyzed them with three research questions about the data, methodologies, and results to understand this research domain. Our findings are expected to inform the existing researchers in the research domain about the future research directions, enable newcomers to understand the overall process of analyzing social media data, and provide the practitioners with social media analysis approaches suitable for their environment.

AB  - The effects of geothermal brine salinity on optimal operating parameters of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power plant are investigated. For a more comprehensive understanding of the problem, a multi-objective optimization study is conducted aiming at minimizing the total heat transfer area while maximizing the exergy efficiency of the ORC. The optimization problem is solved using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II. The multi-criteria decision making results show that an increase in the salinity (from 0.00 kgkg−1 to 0.12 kgkg−1) lowers the total heat transfer area and exergy efficiency by 4.39% (from 82.0 m2 to 78.4 m2) and 7.72% (from 28.5% to 26.3%), respectively. An adverse impact of the salinity on the exergy efficiency is dominant resulting in higher system size (reaching 8.00%) for obtaining the same exergy efficiency. For the same reason, a lower exergy efficiency (up to 5.00%) is reported for a system with the predefined heat exchangers size. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the salinity influence on the heat transfer area and exergy efficiency is mainly associated with a decrease in the mass flow rate of the working fluid. Moreover, salinity can increase the exergy flow rate of the brine thereby impacting the exergy efficiency. It is concluded that the salinity of the geothermal water should be considered in designing the ORC for a geothermal power plant because of its significant impact on the performance of the system.

KW  - Water supply systems
AB  - Pipelines are urban infrastructure used as a means of transporting water (in small or large volume) across cities. One of the major challenges facing the transportation of water through pipeline infrastructure is the water lost through leaks caused by pipeline crack, corrosion, and third-party interference. Water loss through leaking pipes is recognized as a costly problem worldwide, strongly linked with a waste of precious natural resource, environmental pollution and financial loss. The water loss occurs in all distribution systems even though the volume of the losses differs. In severe cases, water loss level as high as 60% of the total input volume may occur. It, therefore, constitutes a major threat to the operation of municipal water services. Owing to its consequential effect, controlling water losses through pipe leakage detection and localisation is a major priority of municipal water service. Therefore, effective control of water losses is highly essential. This requires good leakage detection and localisation methodology as well as active decision making. To achieve this, decision support systems (DSS) have been utilised to detect and control leaks in water distribution systems. To this end, this paper presents a literature synopsis on the DSS utilised for leak detection and control in water supply systems. Research works in this domain are investigated. Finally, future studies are discussed.

AB  - In recent years, the application of flax fiber reinforced composites has attracted much attention from the automobile and construction industries. From the composites reinforcement point of view, the flax fiber is an efficient alternative to the glass fiber in terms of the cost, mechanical properties and environmental effects. The current study investigates the multi-objective optimization of hybrid laminated composite plates with objective functions of minimizing the cost and maximizing frequency gaps. In order to assess the capabilities of the flax fibers in reinforcing composites, a set of multi-objective design optimization problems of hybrid composite plates with discrete design variables of material types and fiber orientations are investigated. Numerical results obtained from the hybrid graphite-glass/epoxy and graphite-flax/epoxy composite plates with different aspect ratios demonstrate that the application of flax fibers can not only reduce the cost and increase the fundamental frequency, but also provide the optimum designs with bigger gaps between two consecutive natural frequencies.

In parallel, digitalization and servitization research streams are merging and paving the way for the Smart Product-Service System (Smart PSS). By analyzing the concept of Smart PSS, this paper questions the convergence between digital and service orientations and considers how digital technologies are used to enable decisions along the PSS lifecycle and/or at different planning levels. Applying topic modeling, a semi-systematic literature review on the combination of digital technologies with PSS has highlighted five main research streams: PSS design, digital servitization, assessing tool for PSS decisions, knowledge management along the lifecycle, sustainability business models. The development over time of these research streams has been tracked leading to the definition of a new research agenda on Smart PSS.

AB  - Effective and efficient personalized search is one of the most pursued objectives in the era of big data. The challenge of this problem lies in its complex quantifying evaluations and dynamic user preferences. A user-involved interactive evolutionary algorithm is a good choice if it has reliable preference surrogate and powerful evolutionary strategies. A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) assisted Interactive Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (IEDA) is presented to enhance the IEDA in solving the personalized search. Specifically, a dual-RBM module is developed to simultaneously provide a preference surrogate and a probability model for conducting the individual selection and generation of the IEDA. Firstly, the positive and negative preferences of the currently involved user in IEDA are distinguished and combined to achieve a dual-RBM, and then the weighted energy functions of the RBM model together with social group information from users with similar preferences are designed as the preference surrogate. The probability of the trained positive RBM on the visible units is fetched as the reproduction model of EDA since it reflects the attribute distributions of more preferred items. Some benchmarks from the Movielens and Amazon datasets are applied to experimentally demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the interactive evolutionary computations served personalized search.

AB  - With rapid economic development and urbanization, there has been an increased generation and discharge of municipal sewage in China, ultimately increasing the amount of sewage sludge entering the treatment facilities. Given this rising problem, finding environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and socially acceptable disposal options for the municipal sewage sludge is crucial for sustainable development. This study evaluated various sludge disposal and treatment technologies for their environmental, economic, and social sustainability and developed an assessment model using multi-criteria decision-making methods. A combined Analytic Hierarchy Process and Vlsekriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje approach was used for sequencing of the alternatives and evaluation of the most sustainable disposal system based on a set of sustainability indicators. The model results were validated using the Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution method. Six typical municipal sewage sludge disposal technologies in China were selected for evaluation. The results showed that municipal sewage sludge disposal through land application revealed the best performance (Q = 0.000), and proved to be the ideal choice for sustainable sludge treatment. This was followed by building materials application (Q = 0.207) and disposal through pyrolysis (Q = 0.362), while landfill showed the highest environmental impact and least overall benefit (Q = 1.000). Then, a sensitivity analysis showed that the results obtained are robust and effective, and weight changes of more than 80% indicated land application to have the best performance. Finally, the predicaments and suggestions of municipal sewage sludge land application was analyzed in China from the aspects of standard and sludge quality.

AB  - The burnishing process is an efficient finishing operation which is widely used to enhance the surface properties of the machined components. The published works mainly focused on the parameters optimization of the burnishing process in which objective functions are relative to burnished surface qualities. Because of natural resource exhaustion and the rising energy prices, the reduction in energy consumption is an urgent demand in the manufacturing industry. This paper presented an efficient optimization to simultaneously decrease energy consumption as well as the mean roughness depth and improve the Brinell hardness for the burnished surface of H13 steel. The burnishing speed, feed rate, depth of penetration, and the number of rollers were the input parameters. The burnishing processes were carried out on a CNC milling machine. The mathematical relations between inputs and outputs were developed using the radius basis function models. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution were used to generate the Pareto fronts and to determine the best solution. The results show that energy consumption and surface roughness are reduced by 39.50% and 7.83%, respectively. The Brinell hardness is improved by 29.61% compared to the initial values. The radial basis function models can be effectively used to render the approximations and to predict the response’s values. The proposed method can be considered as a sufficient approach for modeling and optimizing the burnishing process.

AB  - The replacement of natural coarse aggregate (NCA) with recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) in concrete mixtures offers various advantages, including conservation of natural resources, reduction of CO2 emissions, and cost reduction. However, multiple related variables and objectives (e.g., mechanical, economic, and environmental objectives) need to be considered when optimizing mixtures of recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). This cannot be achieved through traditional laboratory- or statistics-based methods. This study proposes a hybrid intelligent system based on artificial intelligence (AI) and metaheuristic algorithms for designing optimal mixtures of RAC. To verify the proposed model, a data set containing 344 different RAC mixtures was collected from previous literature. A semi-supervised cotraining algorithm using two k-nearest neighbor (kNN) regressors with different distance metrics is developed to label the unlabeled data in the collected dataset. Different AI models are incorporated into the system for modeling the relationship between RAC strength and its influencing variables. A multi-objective optimization (MOO) model based on AI algorithms and on a multi-objective firefly algorithm is used to search for optimal mixtures of RAC. The results show that kNN-based semi-supervised cotraining can effectively exploit unlabeled data to improve the regression estimates. In the test set, A Random Forest and Backpropagation Neural Network achieve the best prediction accuracy for predicting, respectively, uniaxial compressive strength and splitting tensile strength of RAC, indicated by the highest correlation coefficients (0.9064 and 0.8387, respectively) and lowest root-mean-square errors (6.639 MPa and 0.5119 MPa, respectively). The Pareto fronts of the multi-objective mixture optimization problem are successfully obtained by the MOO model. The proposed system can also be used to optimize mixture proportions of other cementitious materials in civil engineering.

AB  - Human factors/errors (such as inappropriate actions by operators and unsafe supervision by organizations) are a primary cause of oil spill incidents. To investigate the influences of active operational failures and unsafe latent factors in offshore oil spill accidents, an integrated human factor analysis and decision support process has been developed. The system is comprised of a Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) framework to qualitatively evaluate the influence of various factors and errors associated with the multiple operational stages considered for oil spill preparedness and response (e.g., oil spill occurrence, spill monitoring, decision making/contingency planning, and spill response); coupled with quantitative data analysis by Fuzzy Set Theory and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy-TOPSIS) to enhance decision making during response operations. The efficiency of the integrated human factor analysis and decision support system is tested with data from a case study to generate a comprehensive priority rank, a robust sensitivity analysis, and other theoretical/practical insights. The proposed approach improves our knowledge on the significance of human factors/errors on oil spill accidents and response operations; and provides an improved support tool for decision making.
