AB  - Pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones, and other chemicals lacking water quality standards are frequently found in surface water. While evidence is growing that these contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) – those previously unknown, unrecognized, or unregulated – can affect the behavior and reproduction of fish and wildlife, little is known about the distribution of these chemicals in rural, tribal areas. Therefore, we surveyed the presence of CECs in water, sediment, and subsistence fish species across various waterbodies, categorized as undeveloped (i.e., no human development along shorelines), developed (i.e., human development along shorelines), and wastewater effluent-impacted (i.e., contain effluence from wastewater treatment plants), within the Grand Portage Indian Reservation and 1854 Ceded Territory in northeastern Minnesota, U.S.A. Overall, in 28 sites across three years (2016–2018), 117 of the 158 compounds tested were detected in at least one form of medium (i.e., water, sediment, or fish). CECs were detected most frequently at wastewater effluent-impacted sites, with up to 83 chemicals detected in one such lake, while as many as 17 were detected in an undeveloped lake. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the number of CECs present in developed versus undeveloped lakes, a range of 3–17 CECs were detected across these locations. Twenty-two CECs were detected in developed and undeveloped sites that were not detected in wastewater effluent-impacted sites. The detection of CECs in remote, undeveloped locations, where subsistence fish are harvested, raises scientific questions about the safety and security of subsistence foods for indigenous communities. Further investigation is warranted so that science-based solutions to reduce chemical risks to aquatic life and people can be developed locally and be informative for indigenous communities elsewhere.

AB  - As one of the devastating natural disasters, landslide may induce significant losses of properties and lives area-wide, and generate dramatic damages to transportation network infrastructure. Accessing the impacts of landslide-induced disruptions to roadway infrastructure can be extremely difficult due to the complexity of involved impact factors and uncertainties of vulnerability related events. In this study, a data-driven approach is developed to assess landslide-induced transportation roadway network vulnerability and accessibility. The vulnerability analysis is conducted by integrating a series of static and dynamic factors to reflect the landslide likelihood and the consequences of network accessibility disruptions. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model was developed to assess and map the landslide likelihood. A generic vulnerability index (VI) was calculated for each roadway link in the network to identify critical links. Spatial distributions of landslide likelihood, consequences of network disruptions, and network vulnerability degrees were fused and analyzed. The roadway network on Oahu Island in Hawaii is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with all the geo-coded information for its network vulnerability analysis induced by area-wide landslides. Specifically, the study area was classified into five categories of landslide likelihood: very high, high, moderate, low, and stable. About 34% of the study area was assigned as the high or very high categories. The results of network vulnerability analyses highlighted the importance of three highway segments tunnel through the Ko‘olau Range from leeward to windward, connecting Honolulu to the windward coast including the Pali highway segment, Likelike highway segment, and Interstate H-3 highway segment. The proposed network vulnerability analysis method provides a new perspective to examine the vulnerability and accessibility of the roadway network impacted by landslides.

AB  - Industrial systems usually draw huge energy to run various machines. The amount of energy requirement has again increased due to the automation of the industrial plants to make them Industry 4.0 compliant. As a result, demand of energy is on the rise in almost all manufacturing and industrial plants. The necessity of critical and smart manufacturing processes in Industry 4.0 and its increased energy requirements force us to look for energy efficient techniques for running the deployed computing systems, which are often embedded and integrated within larger machines and have to function under time constraints. Computational efficiency of these real-time embedded systems (RTESs) depends solely on the timely completion of tasks. Task execution with less energy consumption within critical timing constraints is a challenging issue for the designers of RTESs. Thus, task scheduling in these systems require sophisticated energy efficient mechanisms. However, energy efficiency and timeliness are two mutually contradictory objectives, since the former is achieved only with a significant compromise of the later. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, based on the popular multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, to solve this problem. Moreover, in RTESs, precise prediction of timing constraints is difficult before runtime which causes a form of imprecision or uncertainty in the system. Therefore, we use type-2 fuzzy sets (T2 FSs) to model the timing constraints in RTESs and introduce novel algorithms for membership function generation and calculation of fuzzy earliness. Numerical as well as real-life examples are included to demonstrate our proposed technique.

AB  - Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA), which aims to identify and assess potential failure modes in a system, has been widely utilized in diverse areas for improving and enhancing the performance of systems due to it is a powerful and useful risk and reliability assessment instrument. However, the conventional FMEA approach has been suffered several criticisms for it has some shortcomings, such as unable to handle ambiguous and uncertain information, neglect the relative weights of risk criteria, and without considering the psychological behaviors of decision-makers. To ameliorate these limitations, this paper aims at establishing a hybrid risk ranking model of FMEA via combing linguistic neutrosophic numbers, regret theory, and PROMETHEE (Preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation) approach. In the presented model, linguistic neutrosophic numbers are adopted to capture decision-makers’ evaluation regarding the failure modes on each risk criterion. A modified PROMETHEE approach based on regret theory is presented to obtain the risk priority of failure modes considering the psychological behaviors of decision-makers. Moreover, a maximizing deviation model and TOPSIS (Technique for order preference similar to ideal solution) are separately applied to derive the weights of risk criteria and decision-makers. Finally, a numerical example relating to the supercritical water gasification system is employed to implement the presented method, and the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model are validated by the results derived from a sensitivity and comparison analysis.

AB  - Hospital performance evaluation (HPE) has a major role in improving the quality, safety, and effectiveness of health care services, so it is indispensable for proper and continuous operation of hospitals. Although several studies have been performed on HPE, few have used group decision-making (GDM). This study presents a comprehensive multi-criteria GDM model for HPE under uncertain conditions. In this model, we have combined the group best–worst​ method (GBWM) and fuzzy preference programming (FPP) method to create an applicable framework for GDM in which members of a decision-making group including decision-makers (DMs) have different expertise and the importance of criteria and DMs opinions are determined by a supervisor. The advantages of the proposed method include the integration of the GDM process in the form of a single model and there is no need to calculate separately the consistency of the decisions of the decision-making team members. Finally, a case study conducted on 5 hospitals in Tehran is presented to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that Sina Hospital, Baharloo Hospital, and Tehran Heart Center were ranked first to third, respectively. Also, we can conclude from this study that the proposed integrated framework is capable to address the HPE problem by using a GDM and considering the uncertainty of the comparisons made by decision-making team members.

AB  - In 2013, Barrenechea et al. used the Choquet integral as an aggregation function in the fuzzy reasoning method (FRM) of fuzzy rule-based classification systems. After that, starting from 2016, new aggregation-like functions generalizing the Choquet integral have appeared in the literature, in particular in the works by Lucca et al. Those generalizations of the Choquet integral, namely CT-integrals (by t-norm T), CF-integrals (by a fusion function F satisfying some specific properties), CC-integrals (by a copula C), CF1F2-integrals (by a pair of fusion functions (F1, F2) under some specific constraints) and their generalization gCF1F2-integrals, achieved excellent results in classification problems. The works by Lucca et al. showed that the aggregation task in a FRM may be performed by either aggregation, pre-aggregation or just ordered directional monotonic functions satisfying some boundary conditions, that is, it is not necessary to have an aggregation function to obtain competitive results in classification. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss such generalizations of the Choquet integral, offering a general panorama of the state of the art, showing the relations and intersections among such five classes of generalizations. First, we present them from a theoretical point of view. Then, we also summarize some applications found in the literature.

AB  - The mass roll out of solar PV across the Global South has enabled electricity access for millions of people. In the right context, Small Wind Turbines (SWTs) can be complementary, offering the potential to generate at times of low solar resource (night, monsoon season, winter, etc.) and increasing the proportion of the total energy system that can be manufactured locally. However, many contextual factors critically affect the viability of the technology, such as the extreme variability in the wind resource itself and the local availability of technical support. Therefore, performing a detailed market analysis in each new context is much more important. The Wind Empowerment Market Assessment Methodology (WEMAM) is a multi-scalar, transdisciplinary methodology for identifying the niche contexts where small wind can make a valuable contribution to rural electrification. This paper aims to inform the development of WEMAM with a critical review of existing market assessment methodologies. By breaking down WEMAM into its component parts, reflecting upon its practical applications to date and drawing upon insights from the literature, opportunities where it could continue to evolve are highlighted. Key opportunities include shifting the focus towards development outcomes; creating community archetypes; localised studies in high potential regions; scenario modelling and MCDA ranking of proposed interventions; participatory market mapping; and applying socio-technical transitions theory to understand how the small wind niche can break through into the mainstream.

AB  - Recommender system has been emerged as a personalization tool to solve the issue of information overload in an e-commerce environment. Traditional collaborative filtering (CF) based recommender systems (RSs) suggest items to users based on their overall ratings which are used to find out similar users. Multi-criteria ratings are used to capture user preferences efficiently in multi-criteria recommender systems (MCRS), and incorporation of various criteria ratings can lead to higher performance in MCRS. Usually, user relies on the credibility of an item provided through his/her social circle or similar users, which is called a personal view on items from their close ones. However, it is not generally sufficient to depend exclusively on the personal view of the user. Therefore, public view that includes whole community can play a key role in the credibility of an item. In this paper, we propose a MCRS based on the credibility score of an item, which is an aggregated value of credibility scores on various criteria of an item. These credibility scores are computed based on personal and public views. However, different users have different priorities to various criteria of an item. Therefore, we use genetic algorithm (GA) to learn appropriate weights in the aggregation task of credibility score. The experiment results on Yahoo! Movies and modified MovieLens dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed credibility score based MCRS in terms of coverage, recall, precision, and f-measure.

AB  - Thermal hazards of reactive chemicals have been a major concern due to the unceasing occurrences of fire and explosion accidents in industry. Understanding thermal threats of these chemicals not only contributes to the process safety and sustainability in the research and development (R&D) level, but promotes the efficiency of loss prevention, firefighting and emergency responses. Numerous studies have been conducted towards the comprehensive assessment of thermal hazards of reactive chemicals. The chemicals and methods varied in these studies, and yet some topics were commonly concerned by researchers in relevant fields. Further to say, these topics should also be targeted at when dealing with thermal hazards of new chemicals in future. This article provides an up-to-date overview of the common ground regarding the comprehensive understanding of thermal hazards of reactive chemicals in industry level; whereby, the main limitations and challenges to be faced are explored. The discussed key points include, the classification and reactivity of typical reactive chemicals, the fundamental steps towards the comprehensive understanding of their thermal hazards (including the identification of reaction mechanisms, the calculation of reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, and the characterization of thermal safety properties), and the applicable theoretical, experimental and engineering approaches in each step. The primary goal of this review is to lay out the essential basics that should be focused in every trial to comprehensively understand the thermal hazards of reactive chemicals. The further research directions are also presented based on the current research gaps and the context of Industry 4.0.

AB  - The greater parts of Iranian roads are of the asphaltic kind. The real reason behind making this type of road lies in the abundance of bitumen and the cheaper price of the substance in past years. The upward spiraling price of oil at the global level and the liberalization of subsidies were responsible for rocketing prices of asphalt pavement. As a result, a motivation was created to investigate an alternative method called concrete pavements. The construction cost of concrete and asphalt pavement hinges on specifications of the project, but one of the main concerns was about the likelihood of fluctuations in spending during the construction phase. According to the importance of price changes, this paper intends to find which type of concrete and asphalt pavements have lower price changes in Iran. To answer this question, the Monte Carlo simulation is applied. Since the Monte Carlo simulation needs a prediction model and the data used for developing the model hinges on historical data, the authors applied regression and time series methods. The results show that firstly, the regression method has better performance than the time series model and the second, the implementation of concrete pavement has less economic risks in Iranian freeways and highways.

AB  - The traditional assessment method of system reliability is based on unit reliability and probability theory, but the rationale behind this method of assessment does not consider resources and economy. Unit reliability tests tend to consume resources and economy, and consequently, reliability assessment of large systems tends to consume a large amount of resources and economy. Taking the series system and parallel system as examples, this study proves that the traditional assessment method of system reliability is unreasonable, especially from the perspective of resources and economy, as it does not meet green economy and sustainable development goals. The system life cycle diagram model is established on the unit life cycle. A green assessment method of system reliability is proposed from the resources and economy perspectives. This proposed method does not depend on the number of units and does not require the consumption of a large amount of resources and economy. This study promotes sustainable and cleaner production. The green assessment method of system reliability is applied to the series system and parallel system to assess system reliability.

AB  - The window-to-wall ratio (WWR), or the proportion of glazing in a building's envelope, influences many design and performance aspects of a building across its life cycle, including aesthetics, material use, daylighting, HVAC size and operating energy consumption, view, and human satisfaction. Prior work argued for reducing WWR to reduce operating energy consumption. The objective of this study is to comprehensively assess the environmental, economic, and social effects of various WWR levels using a triple-bottom line approach. A building information model of the US DOE's large office (12 story) prototype building was developed using Autodesk Revit®. The Tally® Revit application and DOE's EnergyPlus™ were used to perform life cycle assessment (LCA) and assess implications on HVAC equipment sizing, embodied energy of materials, and distribution of operational energy. Designs altering WWR from a baseline of 40% were compared in three different climate zones of the United States. Results showed that increasing the WWR in large office buildings leads to increases in environmental impacts, occupant dissatisfaction, and the life cycle cost for the three different climate zones studied. Most reductions in energy use and environmental impacts were approximately 1% from the baseline scenario for the office building under study. The results imply that while reductions in the WWR do result in improvements across the suite of metrics assessed, other design strategies need to be employed either in conjunction with, or separate from, in order to meet target energy consumption and environmental impact reduction goals within this building program, such as Architecture 2030 Challenges.

AB  - Many researchers have realized the importance of contextual information and focused on designing systems that predict user’s contextual preferences. In this respect, several researches have been devoted to Context-Aware Recommender Systems (CARS). One of the remaining issues in these systems especially the collaborative filtering based ones, is determining which contextual information can be adopted to make effective rating prediction. In fact, many contextual dimensions (e.g., location, time, mood etc.) may affect the user’s preferences, but not all of these dimensions are equally important for the rating prediction effectiveness. Many existing CARS approaches cannot fully capture the influence of relevant contextual dimensions and their interaction on the rating, and furthermore cannot obtain a better recommendation performance. To address these issues, we highlight contextual dimensions weighting, study the correlation between them to elicit the most useful ones, and propose two improved rating prediction methods based on collaborative filtering techniques, involving relevant and dependent contextual dimensions. Experimental results, with respect to rating prediction quality and recommendation performance on both public available and large created contextual datasets, show that our proposal outperforms the existing recommender systems especially on the created datasets.

It also performs the appropriate conversion of these intentions into real physical vehicle maneuvers based on ROS. The proposed architecture offers gradually 4 levels of reactivity, from arch-reflex to the deep modification of the previously built symbolic execution plan. The presented use-case, the daily delivery of a network of pharmacy offices by an autonomous vehicle taking into account contextual (spatio-temporal) traffic features, shows the efficiency and the modularity of the architecture, as well as the scalability of the reaction levels.

AB  - The advantages of logistics centers for companies, cities, and countries have been discussed in the literature and generally mathematical model-based evaluations besides multi-criteria approaches are proposed for site selection processes. However, since mathematical modeling of multiple site selection often turns out to be NP-hard problem structure, it is not always possible to obtain an optimal solution by the solvers. For this reason, various meta-heuristic approaches have emerged to solve these complex models. In this context, the aim of this study is to propose an integrated methodology which seeks an optimum result efficiently regarding a logistics center location selection problem. Thus, the optimal clustering of logistics mobility in a metropolitan area was carried out with GIS and a meta-heuristic approach. GIS produced the spatial information needed by p-median model, then the meta-heuristic approach determined the optimal result that considers the logistics costs. BPSO algorithm has employed as the meta-heuristic and it is observed that the algorithm can reach the optimum results within superior times for the problem sizes tested where binary integer programming verified the optimums and the algorithm continued to reach improved solutions where the exact algorithms failed for larger instances. The integrated solution methodology is applied to a large metropolitan region and it is found that it can be used properly by the urban city planners and supply chain managers to analyze critical nodes of transportation networks of megacities.

AB  - Rockburst hazards are generally recognized as one of the main types of geological hazards that affect the construction safety of underground engineering in areas with high ground stress. As such, rockburst prediction has become a common challenge for engineers worldwide. This paper presents a pioneering rockburst prediction method, referred to as the two-step comprehensive evaluation model, based on multiple empirical criteria. Five empirical criteria – the elastic energy index criterion, the Russenes criterion, the Tao criterion, the rock brittleness coefficient criterion, and the rock mass intact coefficient criterion were adopted to construct the primary evaluation model. The weight coefficients were subsequently assigned to the five empirical criteria according to the rough set theory. Finally, the two-step comprehensive evaluation model was constructed using the obtained weight coefficient and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS). Twenty rockburst samples were collected to assess the validity of the two-step model. The results indicated that the lowest error rate decreased significantly from 45% (calculated with the primary evaluation model) to 25% (derived from the two-step model). The two-step model was compared with existing artificial intelligence methods and the results showed that the two-step model had better prediction performance in this study of rockburst cases. Thus, the presented model offers guidance for predicting underground rockburst hazards.

AB  - Design for Remanufacturing (DfRem) plays an important role in remanufacturing, which promotes the product remanufacturability, and enhance the efficiency of remanufacturing processes. However, due to the large and fuzzy demand data, it is difficult to accurately extract DfRem targets from the customer demand data. Moreover, the process of DfRem scheme generation includes conceptual design, general design and detailed design. The remanufacturability of products needs be considered at the design process, which makes the DfRem scheme solution process very complicated. For the purpose of accurately extracting DfRem targets and shortening design cycle, it is necessary to apply intelligent technology for customer demand analysis and DfRem solution. To address this, an intelligent DfRem method based on vector space model (VSM) and case-based reasoning (CBR) is proposed. Firstly, for accurate extraction of DfRem targets, VSM is employed to extract customer demand data features from the mass customer demand data embedded with remanufacturing information, and K-means technique is applied to classify customer demand data features thus to extract DfRem targets. After extraction of DfRem targets, CBR is utilized to retrieve the case that is most similar to the DfRem targets from DfRem and remanufacturing process knowledge bases. In order to improve the accuracy of the retrieval, ontology is used to construct standard knowledge expression. Finally, this method has been evaluated utilizing the DfRem of clutch remanufacturing as case studies. The results show that the method can accurately generate design scheme to satisfy the customer demands. In this paper, the intelligent DfRem method has been developed by Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL Server, which can quickly generate the most suitable solution.

AB  - In the present research, the reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) of labyrinth weirs has been investigated. The optimization problem is formulated such that the optimal shape of trapezoidal labyrinth weir described by a number of variables is found by minimizing the volume of the trapezoidal labyrinth weir and maximizing the reliability index. The constraint conditions are the weir geometric shape and its different ratios. In order to achieve this purpose, a framework is presented whereby non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is integrated with monte carlo simulation (MCS) method to solve the RBDO approach of trapezoidal labyrinth weirs. The proposed method is applied to UTE Dam labyrinth weir, and the results are compared with the real one. The results show the need for design based on reliability in the labyrinth weirs that propose using RBDO for weir design. The results showed that RBDO approach can achieve a more reliable design in addition to reducing the volume of the trapezoidal labyrinth weir. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the parameters effective on the reliability index revealed that three design variables of weir width, total upstream head and discharge coefficient are the main parameters affecting weir RBDO solution.

Intelligent buildings are expected to provide benefits such as high efficiency, energy-savings and smart services. IoT-oriented management systems play an important role in providing for the operational optimization of intelligent buildings. The main objective of the present study is to find the key determinants that provide an optimal portfolio of IoT-oriented Intelligent Building Management System (IBMS) adoptive strategies for decision-makers. In an IoT-oriented decision-making model, the IoT characteristics’ measurement for the evaluation and determination of management systems for intelligent building are incorporated through the MCDM method, and incorporates an Activity-Based Costing evaluation and resource constraints into Zero-One Goal Programming in the optimal portfolio selection process. The main results indicate that Disaster Prevention System and Energy Management System would be selected for the office building and Factory Environment Monitoring and Factory Energy Monitoring for the smart factory through the integrated decision model. Simultaneously, the result underlines the significant interrelation between Acts and Regulations and Ecosystem Value Chain to provide government policy making. The main contribution of this study is to provide a new decision model integrating activity-based costing and resource constraints into IBMS optimal portfolio selection.

AB  - With the recent emphasis on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) by both companies, consumers and governments, selecting eco-economic partners is more important than ever. Multiple aspects play critical roles in partner selection, including so many social, environmental, and economic attributes, but considering all of them simultaneously has proved impossible due to limitations in terms of evaluating resources and efficient decision making. Hence, a crucial first step of partner selection in an SSCM context is to decide which criteria to focus on and which to disregard. However, previous literature on partner selection usually treat the establishment of criteria as a given, and also neglect the interrelationships between them. To bridge this research gap, the present study develops a systematic four-stage optimization model for constructing partner selection criteria, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, the improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Our model integrates quantitative and qualitative methodologies to identify, group, filter, and analyze potential alternative criteria for partner selection in sustainable supply chains. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach with a case study of a Chinese electronic and equipment manufacturer.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to analyze flooding hazard and risk from Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based multicriteria perspective in Ambo town and its watershed and proposes strategic measures for sustainable flooding disaster risk management in urban watershed. Land use/land cover, elevation, slope, drainage density, soil, and rainfall were considered as important flooding hazard factors. Analysis of flooding risk was undertaken for Ambo town’s watershed using flooding hazard layer and the two elements at risk, namely human population and land use. Weighted linear combination (WLC) method was used in the process of criteria map aggregation for both flooding hazard and flooding risk. The result of the flooding hazard in the watershed reveals that more proportion of the watershed is high and very high flooding hazard area (60.58%). Moreover, more proportion of the town is high and very high flooding hazard area (66.87%). The result of the flooding risk in the watershed reveals that more proportion of the watershed is high and very high flooding risk area (41.76%). Moreover, half of the town is high and very high flooding risk area (50.09%). An integrated basin wide approach to flood management should be practiced as it is essential to address multiple water related issues at watershed level. Moreover, environmental education should be emphasized to build civic responsibility among the citizens.

AB  - Existing cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tools were designed based on the policies and standards defined by organizations such as the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Frameworks such as the cybersecurity capability maturity model (C2M2) and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) are often used by the critical infrastructure owners and operators to determine the cybersecurity maturity of their facility. Although these frameworks are exceptional at performing qualitative cybersecurity analysis and identifying vulnerabilities, they do not provide a means to perform prioritized mitigation of those vulnerabilities in order to achieve a desired cybersecurity maturity. To address that challenge, we developed a framework and software application called the cybersecurity vulnerability mitigation framework through empirical paradigm (CyFEr). This paper presents the detailed architecture of CyFEr’s enhanced prioritized gap analysis (EPGA) methodology and its application to CSF. The efficacy of the presented framework is demonstrated by comparing against existing similar models and testing against the cyber injects from a real-world cyber-attack that targeted industrial control systems (ICS) in critical infrastructures.

AB  - Question
From the perspective of intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians, what are the barriers to and facilitators of implementing early mobilisation?
Design
A qualitative study using focus groups, with analysis using the Theoretical Domains Framework.
Participants
Physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists and physiotherapists from the ICUs of three university-affiliated hospitals in Montreal, Canada.
Methods
Four focus group meetings were conducted with 33 participating ICU clinicians. Two researchers independently performed thematic content analysis on verbatim transcriptions of the audio recordings using the Theoretical Domains Framework.
Results
Data saturation was reached after the third focus group. Thirty-six barriers were categorised in 13 domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework. The key barriers to early mobilisation were: lack of conviction and knowledge regarding the available evidence about early mobilisation; lack of attention to the provision of optimal care; poor communication; the unpredictable nature of the ICU; and limited staffing, equipment, time and clinical knowledge. Twenty-five facilitators categorised in ten TDF domains were also identified. These included individual-level facilitators (intrinsic motivation, positive outcome expectations, conscious effort to mobilise early, good planning/coordination, the presence of ICU champions, and expert support by a physiotherapist) and organisational-level facilitators (reminder system, pro-early mobilisation culture, implementation of an early mobilisation protocol, and improved ICU organisation).
Conclusions
A broad array of barriers to and facilitators of early mobilisation in the ICU were identified in this study. Clinicians can consider whether these barriers and facilitators are operating in their ICU. These may inform the design of tailored knowledge translation interventions to promote early mobilisation in the ICU.

AB  - In the field of safety science, we have stopped competing empirically. The theorists fight each other with keynotes and editorials, the empiricists tinker within the boundaries of existing theory, and the practitioners use neither theory nor evidence to determine their activities. As a result, safety science is advancing very slowly, despite a high and increasing volume of research activity and publication. The journal Safety Science alone has published over a thousand articles in the past five years and has rejected over five thousand. Some of those articles were the capstones of PhD projects. Some were the outputs of publicly or industry-funded research. Most represented hundreds of hours of intellectual labour, and substantial emotional commitment. Taken together, this is a massive program of work that has had a marginal impact on moving existing theory or improving safety practice. Whilst it is tempting to believe that this is just the normal grunt-work of science – small steps, dead ends, and occasional breakthroughs – a close examination of the work being produced makes clear that the unproductive effort is not necessary swarf from the machine-work of making knowledge, but waste caused by poorly directed or poorly designed research. Such squandering of energy, talent and resources makes us furious. This paper, targeted at the Special Issue on the Future of Safety Science, is a proposal for how we should frame our empirical contributions so that safety science (and the journal Safety Science) has a positive future. For a field of research to move forward, each new project or paper must strive to change what has come before – adding, synthesising, testing, tearing down or making anew. Not every piece of work will be successful in creating lasting change – but every piece of work must genuinely try to advance current theory. The paper frames and justifies a set of commitments by the authors in order to find a brighter future for safety science and invites readers to share those commitments.

AB  - This paper develops a systematic and practical construction methodology of a representative urban driving cycle for electric vehicles, taking Xi’an as a case study. The methodology tackles four major tasks: test route selection, vehicle operation data collection, data processing, and driving cycle construction. A qualitative and quantitative comprehensive analysis method is proposed based on a sampling survey and an analytic hierarchy process to design test routes. A hybrid method using a chase car and on-board measurement techniques is employed to collect data. For data processing, the principal component analysis algorithm is used to reduce the dimensions of motion characteristic parameters, and the K-means and support vector machine hybrid algorithm is used to classify the driving segments. The proposed driving cycle construction method is based on the Markov and Monte Carlo simulation method. In this study, relative error, performance value, and speed-acceleration probability distribution are used as decision criteria for selecting the most representative driving cycle. Finally, characteristic parameters, driving range, and energy consumption are compared under different driving cycles.

AB  - Prediction of structural complexity for geohazard and subsurface resource applications requires constraining and interpreting data that are often ambiguous or lack key information. Moreover, structural complexity is a subjective term, requiring context for quantification. Recognizing this, a new knowledge-data framework and a geospatial fuzzy logic method is developed to represent and predict structural complexity in the subsurface. A conceptual model for known structural complexity serves as a basis for associating geospatial representations with types of damage zones. A second conceptual model for zones of structural complexity facilitates its prediction, notably in areas with limited explicit structural data. For each conceptual model, a fuzzy logic inference model is developed to incorporate geospatial data and estimate structural complexity potential. This approach is demonstrated using several public geospatial datasets within the state of Oklahoma. Explicit fault and earthquake location data were integrated using a fuzzy model of known structural complexity to train topographic, lithologic, and geophysical proxy datasets, applied to a fuzzy model to predict structural complexity, and evaluated with Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses and error classification. The final model output, displayed in maps and cross sections, offers comparison with interpreted structural data for validation. Together, these results demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of the new approach as a screening tool for predicting structurally complex areas.

Based on Beetle Antennae Search (BAS) algorithm, radiation perceiving motion model and BAS-based radiation-avoiding algorithm are designed. In view of shortcomings of BAS for radiation avoiding, an improved radiation perceiving motion model and a local perceiving and target-attractive radiation avoiding path optimization algorithm are designed. The proposed algorithms have high computational efficiency and simple process. Besides, a graphical simulation program of the proposed algorithm is established. Comparison results of computer simulation prove effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithms. Experimental results obtained in a simulated environment show that the proposed algorithm could be useful to meet the challenges of radiation avoiding applications that can be described as optimization problems.

AB  - Green building (GB) incentives help address the barriers in GB development. After years of practice, the GB market is becoming mature; thus, these incentives should be adjusted to adapt to the market transformation. However, adjusting incentives can affect stakeholders' motives and concerns, which in turn influence stakeholders' attitudes towards green buildings. Therefore, going back to the basics and understanding how an incentive scheme works before implementing any adjustment are important for policymakers. This study aims to reveal how incentive mechanism design affects stakeholders’ choices of GB levels in tangible and intangible ways. The Gross Floor Area Concession Scheme implemented in Hong Kong is selected as a case study. Cost–benefit analysis, particularly transaction cost, and the analytical hierarchy process method are used to evaluate the costs and benefits in terms of monetary value and importance. Then, a causal loop diagram is constructed to explain the incentive mechanism. Results show that although actual costs and benefits are more important than hidden ones, transaction cost can be a decisive factor for selecting GB levels. Cost–benefit analysis with transaction cost considerations should be conducted to improve GB incentives. In addition, fast sales of high levels of GB can be a critical compensation for extra costs. Alternatives for improving incentives are also provided based on the findings. This study helps enrich the incentive mechanism for promoting high levels of GB. It provides empirical evidence on the magnitude of transaction cost and proves the soundness of conducting a holistic cost–benefit analysis by incorporating transaction cost.

AB  - The topological changes and re-configuration can be brought into an existing power network by operation of sectionalizing switches on the feeder lines. Distribution networks can be operated either in meshed or in radial configuration. While primary meshed distribution networks have advantages like lower short circuit current, reduced overall conductor length and increased reliability and fault tolerance, the radial networks on the other hand stand-out on their merits of simple installation and easier relay coordination. An optimal radial network can operate at higher efficiency owing to its reduced power losses and can offer higher voltage stability. Transformation of a primary meshed network to a radially reconfigured optimal network requires selection of the “best” set of switches on the feeders that are to be opened or closed so that each feeder can be operated close to its maximum loadability limit and the resulting optimal network operates at its lowest feasible value of power loss and highest voltage stability index. This theoretical concept of optimal power network radialization is however difficult to implement in practice due to the heavy computational burden and unacceptably long searching time as the number of feasible alternative configurations is usually massive for large power networks. Given the extent of the search space, the heuristic search approaches are usually more practical and common in power network reconfiguration. This paper presents a novel guided search approach based on Edmond’s Maximal Spanning Tree Algorithm to achieve the optimal radial configuration for an arbitrary power network rapidly and efficiently. Efficacy of the proposed method has been tested on 30-node and 57-node mesh distribution networks with encouraging results.

KW  - Repair Effectiveness Index
AB  - Imperfect maintenance modeling and analysis of repairable systems involves an additional parameter called repair effectiveness index (REI) ‘q’, along with shape and scale parameters in generalized renewal process (GRP), which is a measure of the quality of repair or repair effectiveness (RE). The quantitative measure of this parameter as proposed by Kijima through his virtual age models attracted enough attention and is extensively used by the researchers. But, RE could be dependent on many subjective factors and also requires qualitative analysis as well for better understanding of repair effects and performance. Quantitative assessment of RE is necessary but not sufficient to analyze it completely. The paper brings out the limitations of the quantitative assessment of RE and highlights the need for further examining it qualitatively. This paper conducts an extensive study with the help of field experts on selection and analysis of various factors affecting RE and proposes eleven primary factors and their sub-factors (total 55 factors/sub-factors) which affect it the most. After due selection of the factors and sub-factors, the paper then proposes a Bayesian network (BN) to model their dependency on each other and with RE. As a result, the proposed BN model provides the measurable effect of all the selected factors and sub factors on RE in percentage form. The results are demonstrated with the help of two examples inspired by practical industrial applications. The presented work could be extremely useful for industries in undertaking reliability improvement of repairable systems by analyzing their repair quality in detail. The proposed methodology can also be used as fundamental guidelines to develop basic understanding of the repair effectiveness and how it can be improved for a particular system leading to an overall improvement in the reliability of the system.

AB  - Software bugs are inevitable. Large software projects often use bug tracking systems in order to collect, organize and keep track of reported bugs. The primary objective of using these bug tracking systems is to expedite the bug fix process which further improves the overall quality of software product. However, managing bug tracking systems incurs additional cost and efforts. Hence, it is important to monitor the performance of the bug fix process which is followed in bug tracking systems. The aim of this paper is to identify the performance characteristics of the bug fixing process in open source bug repositories. Various performance metrics have been investigated which measures the bug fix process quality. For experimental evaluation, bug reports are collected from Bugzilla repository of Mozilla Firefox, Eclipse, NetBeans and Open Office projects. It has been found that overall 45.67% of bug reports are closed with fixed resolution. Rest 54.33% bug reports keep lying in bug repository unresolved thereby creating an extra backlog of work for software developers. Further, the root causes have been determined which keeps these large portions of bug reports lying in bug repositories opened and found that Non-Reproducible bugs are the most deteriorating factor in bug fix process and affects the fix process performance negatively.

AB  - Cool skin technologies, including high-reflective coating and vertical greening, are beneficial for passive energy-saving in buildings and are particularly useful in the renovation of existing buildings. Based on a numerical heat transfer model, a technology framework combining a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and a multiple criteria decision-making method, is proposed. The proposed method can rapidly determine the optimal application solution of cool skin technologies on a building’s exterior walls. The optimal solution considers cost, energy-savings, and the environmental benefits. The technology framework has been explored in four typical cities in China using an office building as the prototype. The results demonstrate that, when comparing the performance of cool skin technologies, the differences in the wall orientations and the climate zones should be considered. Except for the buildings with winter heating demands in northern China, which should keep a bare wall in the south orientation, the prefabricated greening technology outperforms the climbing greening technology and the high-reflective coating technology in reducing the building cooling or heating load. With the geographical latitude decreases, the technical advantages of vertical greening become more significant.

AB  - Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), in the most recent technology, is used for tracking and detecting the objects, remote monitoring and so on. The requirements of QoS, mainly for consumption of energy, at application layer is very critical issue in WSN. Wastage of energy is a considerable factor when many number of attempts for transmission is made, whenever failure occurs, due to interference and dynamics of channels. As WSN is comprised of autonomous devices and are also resource-limited, the devices need to be monitored depending on many physical phenomena in specific field of interest. Most of the time, because of uncertainty in monitored environments, WSNs function as stochastic systems which leads to some critical challenges faced by the sensor network. The major objective is to maintain low cost and efficient service time using few adaptive methods for the formation of topology, resource and power optimization, exchange of data, object detection, coverage of sensing, and security. To achieve such design goals and to reduce energy consumption, the sensor nodes have to make optimized decision from different accessible strategies. In this work, survey on applications of Markov Decision Process (MDP) is presented by designing the MDP framework which is a powerful tool for decision making and further providing solutions to obtain energy efficient sensor network. This framework includes the development of protocols and adaptive algorithms in WSN. Also various methods for solution are discussed and the methods are compared to assist as a guide for using MDPs in Wireless Sensor Network.

AB  - This paper aims to investigate how the sustainable development is pursued by manufacturing companies according to the extant literature, especially by focusing on Circular Economy (CE) paradigm that is considered one of the major drivers for sustainability. Indeed, this research aims to study how CE principles have been adopted in the manufacturing sector leading towards the creation of Circular Manufacturing (CM) strategies. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review has been conducted. Scopus and Web of Science are the scientific databases used for the review process. The 215 papers selected for the review were analysed through a theoretical framework developed by the authors. This framework enabled to individualize the research streams and the perspectives through which CE strategies adopted by manufacturers have been studied in the extant scientific literature. These research streams are technologies, and evaluation methods and models. Besides, both of these two are studied under two different lenses since they both are mutually considered supportive tools to shift or to maintain a circular system. To conclude, one of the major contributions of this literature review is to provide a clearer definition of CM and to figure out how CM strategies have been addressed by academics in the scientific literature, with the final aim to reduce the confusion emerged in the extant literature around this concept. Last, this review elucidates some scientific literature gaps and suggests future research directions.

AB  - Disasters are usually managed through a four-phase cycle including mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. The first two phases happen before a disaster and the last two after it. This survey focuses on casualty management (CM), which is one of the actions taken in the response phase of a disaster. Right after a severe disaster strikes, we may be confronted with a large number of casualties in a very short period of time. These casualties are in need of urgent treatment and their survival depends on a rapid response. Therefore, managing resources in the first few hours after a disaster is critical and efficient CM can significantly increase the survival rate of casualties. Uncertainty in the location of a disaster, disruption to transportation networks, scarcity of resources and possible deaths of rescue and medical teams due to the disaster in such situations make it hard to manage casualties. In this survey, we focus on CM for disasters where the following five steps are taken, respectively: (i) Resource dispatching/search and rescue, (ii) on-site triage, (iii) on-site medical assistance, (iv) transportation to hospitals and (v) triage and comprehensive treatment. With a special focus on Operations Research (OR) techniques, we categorize the existing research papers and case studies in each of these steps. Then, by critically observing and investigating gaps, trends and the practicality of the extant research studies, we suggest future directions for academics and practitioners.

AB  - Advance guide signs for exit ramps along urban expressways are increasingly critical, enhancing safety and mobility by improving the flow of vehicles exiting urban expressways. However, research has devoted scant attention to advance guide signs for exit ramps. This study aimed to identify and propose optimal design alternatives for exit ramp advance guide signs for different types of exit spacing. This study conducted a driving simulation experiment consisting of five design alternatives of advance guide signs and two exit ramp spacing variation. Eight indicators were measured. The repeated-measure analysis of variances (ANOVA) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) were performed for the influence analysis and efficiency evaluation of different schemes. Influence analysis results showed better design alternatives in five schemes of advance guide signs, enabling drivers to more easily locate destination exits and change lanes fewer times, in addition to reducing drivers’ need to decelerate, and improving traffic flow in the key influence range of destination exit ramps. The percentage of drivers successfully locating the destination exits also increased with optimal design alternatives of advance guide signs. When the exit ramp spacing tightened, on the other hand, drivers had to make more lane changes and accelerate and decelerate more frequently in the key influence range. As a result, a lower percentage of drivers successfully located destination exits. Efficiency evaluation results were also obtained. In tight spacing, three advance guide signs are recommended to be placed at 1 km, 0.5 km and 0 km prior to the beginning of the tapered deceleration lane. If conditions are limited, at least two advance guide signs should be used. With greater spacing, four advance guide signs are recommended, located at 2 km, 1 km, 0.5 km, and 0 km prior to the beginning of the tapered deceleration lane. If road conditions are limited, three advance guide signs should be used.

The results showed that the Port Elizabeth station, had the lowest levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) with the value of -0.363 $/kWh when using the EOLO wind turbine, and the Bloemfontein station had the highest LCOE with the value of 1.601 $/kWh when using the Turby wind turbine. The results from the step-wise assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) weighting method demonstrated the wind penetration, total production, and capital cost as the most important sub-indices with the weights of 0.106, 0.095, and 0.091, respectively. Using the additive ratio assessment (ARAS), weighted sum method (WSM), and weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) techniques, the cities under study were ranked, and the cities of East London and Bloemfontein were identified as the most suitable and the most unsuitable stations for the use of household-scale wind turbines, respectively.

Multi-objective optimization algorithms are needed in order to simultaneously optimize the dynamic aperture and the momentum aperture. In this study we demonstrate the application of a highly efficient stochastic optimization algorithm, the multi-generation Gaussian process optimizer (MG-GPO), to storage ring nonlinear dynamics optimization by successfully applying the method to the SPEAR3 upgrade lattice. It is shown that the new method, owing to its capability of selecting high rank candidates from a large number of trial solutions, converges significantly faster than the commonly used traditional algorithms, multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO).

AB  - As a response to emergency events occurred frequently around the world, energy emergency supply chain collaboration has becomes a business imperative with multiple energy trading organizations to respond it by group consensus. However, managing agile energy emergency supply chain collaboration, with the minimum energy recovery time regarding energy supply shortage driven by urgent events such as earthquake, is confronted with a difficult task: govern non-cooperative behaviours of energy emergency supply chain collaboration that identifies the irrational causes underlying deviations from neoclassical utility-maximizing economic decisions. In this paper, develop a smart model for energy emergency supply chain collaboration that the work bridges the divide between emergency supply chain collaboration optimization with group consensus and reinforcement learning. It sets up collaboration consensus with scenarios learning algorithm driven by the satisfaction-level combination of generalising past experience and future scenarios to new local energy supply shortage emergency situations to govern non-cooperative irrational behaviours, resulting in the response process with the minimum energy recovery time, cost and CO2 emissions. Simulations results show that proposed model has a significantly lower running time by 40%, and reduces minimisation of cost for energy restoration by 7% and minimisation of CO2 emissions by 10.8% on average.

AB  - This paper presents the optimal dynamic investment allocation on intelligent transportation infrastructure construction and road maintenance with considering environmental costs. We propose a stochastic optimal control problem with uncertain traffic volume, aiming to minimize the expected system total cost, which consists of the fixed travel cost, the congestion delay cost, the congestion environmental cost and the road maintenance environmental cost. By adopting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, we propose the optimal dynamic strategy for investment allocation, which is a feedback control and determined by two observable variables, i.e., traffic volume and road network capacity. We also conduct a case study of Beijing, China, for the proposed dynamic strategy. The numerical results demonstrate that our strategy can lower the congestion delay and related environmental cost significantly, which is enough to remedy the possible increase in the road maintenance environmental cost. Comparing with traditional strategies, the new dynamic strategy provides closely 100% of the benefit cases.

AB  - In actual operation, solid oxide fuel cells are vulnerable to performance degradation. Predicting degradation trends and taking appropriate measures to reduce voltage degradation can prolong the lifetime of fuel cells. In addition, because the influence of related factors on the voltage degradation and efficiency are mutually coupled, it is necessary to take into account the efficiency when decreasing the voltage degradation. Therefore, in this study a prognostic-based dynamic optimization strategy is proposed to quantitatively extend the fuel cell’s life without significantly compromising on the generating efficiency. For the lack of learning samples, a prognostic method based on the similarity of phase space trajectory is utilized to estimate the remaining useful life of the fuel cell, and it is compared with a traditional data-driven prognostic method. A multi-objective dynamic optimization method is employed to determine the optimal efficiency-voltage degradation solution through the predicted operating lifetime. Using the proposed prognostic-based dynamic optimization strategy, the results show that the lifetime of the fuel cell can be effectively extended without significant reduction in the generating efficiency for three test degradation trajectories.

AB  - The evaluation of the intelligent logistics eco-index (ILEI) can comprehensively and objectively reflect the development status and the potential problems of the intelligent logistics ecological chain (ILEC). It can provide a reference for the optimization and improvement of the ecological chain. By analyzing and summarizing the relevant literature of the ILEC from 2010 to 2019, this paper constructs an evaluation system that consists of 3 level-1 indicators, 10 level-2 indicators and 24 level-3 indicators. Using the method based on hybrid numerical decision-making to evaluate the ILEI, it takes into account the situation in which the original data contain both interval and fixed-value data, objectively obtains the weight vector by using the improved interval deviation degree and scheme attribute deviation maximization thought, and finally establishes the possibility decision matrix and calculates the ILEI based on the sorting theory of fuzzy complementary judgment matrix. This method has significant advantages over the traditional TOPSIS method. Based on the real case from Qingdao Goodaymart Logistics Company (Goodaymart Logistics), this paper compares the ILEI values among three months in 2019, summarizes the development status, and offers suggestions to Goodaymart Logistics. This study provides an approach for constructing the ILEI to realize an objective evaluation of the development of the ILEC, so as to facilitate the intelligent logistics enterprises in improving the level of ecological development and promoting the healthy development of the ecological chain.

AB  - Foodborne parasites with zoonotic potential are of particular concern for human health, being responsible for serious and potentially life threatening diseases. In the last decades, the development of molecular biology techniques have been successfully implemented for clinical diagnosis of FBPs in animal or human samples providing cheaper, less labor intensive, reliable and more sensitive tests. It is apparent from recent publications that unsubstantiated molecular methods for parasite detection that have undergone scant evaluation for sensitivity and specificity are becoming increasingly common. The aim of the organized Training Schools was to transfer knowledge on application, optimization and troubleshooting for methods used to extract, amplify, and sequence nucleic acids from contaminated matrices and isolated FBPs. The organized Training Schools fulfilled the trainees’ expectations, whom acquired useful knowledge for their research activities.

AB  - Fire station plays an important role in ensuring the safety of people, property and environment. In order to improve the emergency rescue capability of the fire station, its influence factors are distinguished and a capability evaluation system is established in the present paper. The system is composed of goal layer, criteria layer and sub-criteria layer. The goal layer is the evaluation objective, namely, the emergency rescue capability of urban fire station. The criteria layer and sub-criteria layer contain five indexes and 25 indexes, respectively. Within the established evaluation system, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method is chosen to analyze the decision problem. The weight of each index included in the system is determined based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. Thus, the level of the emergency rescue capability of the fire station can be evaluated quantitatively. At last, a fire station in Zhengzhou city is taken as an example to verify the effectiveness of the established system. The results reveal that the emergency rescue capability of the fire station is in general level. Accordingly, the measures to strengthen the rescue capacity of the referred fire station are put forward.

AB  - Nowadays, to achieve sustainability and reliability in the electrical energy production sector, the utilization of flexible technologies, such as the power plants with multiple fuel options, and proper management of hydropower resources are substantial. In this paper, integrated scheduling for fuel dispatching and the generation planning of the power system comprising multi-fuel-fired thermal power plants and hydro units is presented considering a competitive environment of the fuel market. The main focus of this study is on the supply management of the primary energy sources including storable fuel and water resources for the generation of electrical power. The proposed model is given as a multi-objective optimization problem with different objective functions such as fuel consumption cost, fuel transportation cost, penalty cost of hydropower station disposable water, and valve point effect losses. The fuelling network limitations, including natural gas network as well as liquid fuel dispatch network constraints, and power system limitations, including power transmission and power generation constraints, are considered in the proposed model with the aim of achieving appropriate planning for simultaneous fuel dispatching and power generation scheduling. The problem is solved by the augmented e-constraint method and then an analytical hierarchy process technique is employed to select the best possible solution. Finally, the proposed algorithm is performed on the two test systems including the modified IEEE 30-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system integrated with a gas network and a fuelling network for liquid fuel. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed scheme.

AB  - Cities are particularly vulnerable to meteorological hazards because of the concentration of population, goods, capital stock and infrastructure. Urban climate services require multi-disciplinary and multi-sectorial approaches and new paradigms in urban climate modelling. This paper classifies the required urban input data for both mesoscale state-of-the-art Urban Canopy Models (UCMs) and microscale Obstacle Resolving Models (ORM) into five categories and reviews the ways in which they can be obtained. The first two categories are (1) land cover, and (2) building morphology. These govern the main interactions between the city and the urban climate and the Urban Heat Island. Interdependence between morphological parameters and UCM geometric hypotheses are discussed. Building height, plan and wall area densities are recommended as the main input variables for UCMs, whereas ORMs require 3D building data. Recently, three other categories of urban data became relevant for finer urban studies and adaptation to climate change: (3) building design and architecture, (4) building use, anthropogenic heat and socio-economic data, and (5) urban vegetation data. Several methods for acquiring spatial information are reviewed, including remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) processing from administrative cadasters, expert knowledge and crowdsourcing. Data availability, data harmonization, costs/efficiency trade-offs and future challenges are then discussed.

AB  - This work deals with the sorting of the suitability of the roofs for the integration of PV systems, implementable as a GIS (Geographical Information System). Such sorting can provide relevant information to help and guide urban actors further develop solar energy, and therefore contribute to the acceleration of the deployment of this source of energy in cities. Three scenarios of sorting are considered: the energetic, the economic and the multicriteria sorting. The energetic and economic sorting scenarios are actually similar to the great majority of the currently proposed sorting in publicly available solar GIS tools (solar cadastre), which consider only one attribute such as the solar irradiation or the payback period. Knowing the limits of these sorting scenarios, a multicriteria approach is adopted and takes into account more impactful attributes in the urban actors’ choices. The ELECTRE TRI methodology is used for this sorting problem. Different decisional criteria related to energy, economy, historic buildings and heritage, the structure and superstructure states of the roof are identified and detailed. The method is then applied to a set of alternatives (roofs) in a district of Geneva. The sorting results show that the proposed multicriteria scenario better integrates the complexity of the urban environment and provides a more relevant information regarding the suitability of the roofs for PV integration.

AB  - Research on sustainability or sustainable development has emerged significantly over the past two decades, evidenced by an increasing interest and publication momentum by academic scholars. Given the importance of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), that constitute ∼99% of all firms, this paper adopts a three-stage systematic review protocol to present a state of art literature review on sustainable development in SMEs. Four different analysis-synthesis approaches (bibliometric analysis, methodological analysis, qualitative content analysis, and logical reasoning of authors) were used on the literature data of 117 relevant papers (from 37 journals) identified from mainstream academic databases. This review provides insights not previously fully captured or evaluated by other reviews on this topic. The findings provide several implications on the current state of literature on sustainable development in SMEs, leading to research gaps and directions for future research. The findings provide a robust roadmap for further investigation in this field.

AB  - Efficient resource management in a Cloud data center relies on minimizing energy consumption and utilizing physical resource efficiently while maintaining the service-level agreement (SLA) at its highest level. To achieve this goal, dynamically consolidating virtual machines (VMs) is considered a promising method, because it eliminates the hotspots resulting from overloaded hosts and switches the underloaded hosts to sleep mode through the live migration of VMs. However, during the consolidation, each VM migration consumes additional resource, leading to performance degradation and SLA violation. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel adaptive performance-to-power-ratio (PPR)-aware dynamic VM consolidation framework based on both the predicted resource utilization and PPR of the heterogeneous hosts to resolve the trade-off of performance and energy. The proposed framework consists of four stages: (1) host overload detection based on residual available computing capacity; (2) selection of the appropriate VMs for migration from the overloaded hosts based on minimum data transfer; (3) host underload detection based on multi-criteria Z-score approach; (4) allocating the VMs selected for migration from the overloaded and underloaded hosts based on the modified power-aware best-fit decreasing algorithm. To validate the reliability and scalability of the proposed method, we performed experimental evaluation in both real and simulated environments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can reduce the energy consumption effectively and ensure maximal conformity to the quality of service (QoS) requirements across heterogeneous infrastructures, in comparison with the existing competitive approaches.

AB  - The light rail is gaining relevance within cities’ transportation networks due to its adequate balance among sustainability, economic and safety factors. Nevertheless, there is still a gap for improvement in those factors through the optimisation of rolling stock maintenance strategies. The development of new and more flexible maintenance strategies at proper indenture levels will aid to improve the reliability and availability of the light rail during the operation phase, as well as to reduce its life cycle cost. Accordingly, the present research develops a multi-objective maintenance model that adopts a novel reliability-based advanced maintenance policy; whose aim is to consistently evaluate short-term information to enhance both traditional maintenance and organisational key performance indicators. The proposed multi-objective mathematical model is solved through a simulation-based optimisation (SBO), which by means of iteration evaluates different maintenance strategies according to the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II). Empirical results, based on real data obtained from a light rail fleet operating in Spain, demonstrate that the proposed maintenance model for the rolling stock can significantly improve the light rail performance regarding both maintenance and organisational objectives.

AB  - Although scenario planning and the Delphi survey are widely used in long-term strategy planning, their combinations have not received enough attention, especially in the improvement of efficacy in scenario planning. The crucial step of scenario planning is the effective identification of the uncertain and most influential drivers and key factors. This paper integrates the Delphi survey into scenario planning. It proposes a four-step analytical procedure of Delphi survey-based scenario planning: identifying the key ingredients from Delphi results, establishing the causal relationships among key ingredients, scenario development, and scenario description. The integrated method has been adopted in the planning practice for the renewable energy development strategy towards 2030 in China. Based on the three uncertain and most influential drivers, “technology development,” “ecological awareness,” and “national energy pricing,” most possibly influencing the renewable energy development towards 2030 in China, a novel three-dimensional scenario analytical framework composed of eight future scenarios is constructed. Considering the possibility in China's practice, five scenarios are selected as possible development scenarios of China's renewable energy towards 2030. This paper develops possible policy choices for each selected scenario.

AB  - There remains a lack of applied research on risk assessment technology in the safety analysis of the railway signaling system, and the research method in the existing literature mostly is the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). This paper synthetically analyzes and evaluates the merits and demerits of the traditional AHP, the Maximum Absolute Weighted Residual (MAWR), and the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM), finally proposes a comprehensive weighting algorithm organically combining above methods. This algorithm applies to the weighting process under different evaluation matrix conditions. It neutralizes the excessive deviation caused by the human factors in the subjective weighting method and the data factors in the objective weighting method, so it makes the weighting result more reasonable. In addition, based on the comprehensive weighting algorithm, three kinds of typical railway signaling equipment are selected as calculation cases, and the weighting results can be applied in calculating the equipment dangerous failure rate, assessing the equipment safety level, and other risk management processes. This algorithm has practical application value for the risk assessment of the railway signaling system and its apparatus.

AB  - One of the most influential measures of multidimensional well-being, the Better Life Index, launched by OECD in 2011, contains a detailed overview of the social, economic, and environmental performances of different countries. Since its launch, a relevant number of empirical studies have been proposed on these data, but the role played by the distance between societal priorities and country-level performance in Better Life Index as well as in multidimensional well-being remains underexplored. We propose to address this issue by means of a multidimensional spatial model. We position the countries in the Euclidean K-dimensional space in which each dimension is a specific aspect of well-being, and we consider each individual's opinion on the same dimensions to calculate the personal optimal point. The distance between the optimal point of well-being and the actual observed point at individual level is the individuals' loss in well-being. We show that the societal loss at country-level is negatively related to the overall well-being and the main indices of quality of democracy. Based on the above evidence, we would argue that a multidimensional spatial framework represents a promising tool for the analysis of the whole class of multidimensional measures of well-being in which a group of individuals expresses the weights individually assigned to a set of dimensions within a pre-established range.

AB  - Global climate change is a critical issue that everyone will eventually face; for this reason, countries are paying greater attention to sustainable development. It is therefore important to achieve a win-win situation for the environment and economics. The green supply chain focuses on reducing environmental impact during product delivery and satisfying customer service level. However, such situations make the supplier selection problem more complex. Decision-makers need to balance between suppliers’ green levels and consumers’ aspiration levels. The supplier selection problem is a typical multiple criteria decision-making problem. In the green supplier selection problem, only a few studies consider the market segmentation of green consumers. However, the decision environment comprises supplier’s dynamic risk and goals with different importance is not considered. In the green supplier selection problem, to overcome key limitations of previous literature, this study includes several contributions. First, this study constructs a fuzzy goal programming model focusing on the importance of a supplier portfolio and order allocation. To improve satisfaction degree of the green goals, this study proposes a fuzzy goal programming model incorporating multiple importance function. The functions provide adequate satisfaction levels for goals with a lower priority. Second, this study pioneers the integration of a supplier’s dynamic risk and green market segmentation in supplier selection problems. Third, this study analyzes how different ratios of green consumers affect the satisfaction degree of the green goals. Green consumers are willing to convert green consciousness into actual consumption, and the proposed decision problem considers the market bonus by green consumers. The illustrative example, unlike previous studies, shows that the proposed model will not excessively compromised green goals with lower priority for certain decision situations.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the suitable areas for maize (Zea mays L) in semi-arid ecosystem of Mysuru district of Karnataka, Southern India using integrated Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographic Information System (GIS) approach. In the present study, the parameters of soil depth, length of growing period (LGP), soil surface texture, soil drainage, organic carbon (OC), soil pH, slope and elevation were used. AHP method was used to determine the weights of the parameters and scores of the sub-parameters in the study. The modeling capabilities of GIS were used in weighted overlay analysis of input parameters in assessment of land suitability for maize cultivation. The analysis indicates that about 29.9% (188439.4 ha) of the study area is highly suitable, 15.3% (96213.3 ha) is moderately suitable and 18.5% (116671.7 ha) is marginally suitable for maize cultivation. The study demonstrates that the integrated AHP and GIS approach found to be very effective to increase the accuracy in land suitability assessment. The gap analysis between the suitable areas derived from the study and actual mean maize growing area during 2015–16 to 2017–18, shows that about 23.2% (146370.4 ha) of highly suitable and 38.4% (242556.7 ha) of highly and moderately suitable areas together are available to expand the maize cultivation in the district.

AB  - Electric vehicles have significantly contributed to the sustainability of world economic growth. It is of critical importance to understand and examine the factors impacting the consumers’ attitude toward the adoption of electric vehicles. However, limited study investigated the effect of altruism on electric vehicles adoption from a pro-environmental behaviour perspective. Therefore, the present work aimed at identifying the influencing factors on consumers’ intention to use electric vehicles. To this end, a model has been developed based on two theoretical models called the Norm Activation Model and the Theory of Planned Behaviour. The potential consumers in Malaysia were selected to answer questionnaires. Accordingly, 177 valid questionnaires were collected and the influencing factors on the electric vehicles purchase intention were empirically analyzed using a structural equation model. According to the results, perceived value, attitude, the ascription of responsibility, subjective norms, personal norms, perceived consumer effectiveness, and awareness of consequences affected the consumers’ electric vehicles’ purchase intention significantly and positively. Consumers’ behaviour regarding the adoption of electric vehicles can be understood better through the findings of this study, while electric vehicle development can be promoted as well.

AB  - Web services are a popular technology for deploying applications on the Web. They are supported by frameworks, the middleware that handles most communication aspects. Security in the Web is a key concern as the exposure to attacks is high and may result in catastrophic consequences for the deployed services. Selecting the most secure framework is challenging, especially considering their diversity and the complexity involved in any security assessment. This paper is an initial contribution aiming at the definition of a security benchmark for assessing and comparing the security of web service frameworks. The proposed benchmark is based on two phases: Security Qualification and Trustworthiness Assessment. In the first phase, state-of-the-art techniques are used to detect vulnerabilities in the frameworks. If vulnerabilities are found, the framework is disqualified. In the second phase, the qualified frameworks are analyzed for evidences of potentially unsecure aspects, being the observed behavior used to compute a score using the Logic Score of Preferences technique. Such score allows comparing frameworks from a trustworthiness perspective. We applied our approach for the case of DoS Attacks and benchmarked ten frameworks. Results show that six frameworks fail in qualifying for the second phase and that the remaining ones can be ranked using the computed score, allowing developers to make informed decisions about their deployments.

AB  - Scarce resources in a developing country like India calls for the optimal use of the road infrastructure using scientific pavement management tools. In the process of finding ways for modifying the traditional methods of making bituminous roads, the use of waste plastic as a substitute to a certain percentage of bitumen is a promising alternative. Gradual deterioration of road infrastructure is a major concern. A vast amount of condition assessment data must be collected to identify the major defects and their causes, to plan for an optimum maintenance alternative. This study evaluates the deterioration rates of waste plastic modified bituminous roads (also called plastic roads) as compared to normal bituminous roads in the metro city of Pune, India. Measurement of deterioration is done with field tests and distress surveys. Ranking of distress parameters was done using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) where the relative importance (on Saaty’s scale) assigned to each parameter in the hierarchy was given by the experts (transportation professionals). AHP was implemented using the MATLAB package. The study reveals that the deterioration rate for plastic roads is slower as compared to conventional bituminous roads.

AB  - In this study, the main objective was to implement an integrative modelling framework in order to support the prioritization and screening of chemicals present in personal care products (PCPs) regarding their potential to expose users across multiple possible pathways. Here, we implemented an exposure-based framework based on product intake fractions (PiFs) calculated using a two-compartment model reproducing the skin uptake and the competing volatilization of chemicals applied on skin during PCP use. The implemented framework enabled to simultaneously and comprehensively accommodate coupled chemical specific parameters (i.e. physical and chemical properties of the candidate chemicals), exposure information specific for product-chemical combinations, and survey data informing on consumer behavior. A case-study, based on the usage pattern data of 22 PCPs investigated among Swiss individuals (Garcia-Hidalgo et al., 2017a) and 113 candidate chemicals chosen for their suspected presence in the PCP categories of interest was defined to evaluate the applicability of the framework. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and hierarchical clustering were subsequently applied to identify chemicals with the highest exposure potential and to highlight most relevant mixtures of chemicals on the basis of the specific usage patterns of the considered survey individuals.

AB  - Inventory classification is a managerial method utilized to group items that share predetermined characteristics, with the intent of assigning group-specific controls and monitoring mechanisms to each established item group. In this paper, we develop a performance-based inventory classification (PBIC) method that finds a grouping solution for a multi-item, multi-echelon inventory system controlled by continuous review. We argue that instead of grouping items based on similarities in unit cost, demand rate, or leadtime, the most effective strategy is to group items based on the information contained in their control policy values and their performance-related parameter values. We introduce a new policy-driven approach for establishing the classification criteria used to group items. We also adopt a ranking method to control the multi-dimensionality of multi-echelon systems in order to determine a one-dimension score. To group items, we improve the Pareto-based (ABC) solution by developing a search-based partitioning solution, utilizing a novel aggregation process. Our findings indicate that the PBIC method significantly outperforms alternative classification methods. Also, the empirical results show that there is a negligible gap between the performance of the PBIC and the optimal (complete enumeration) grouping solution. Finally, we discuss our work in the context of managerial implications highlighting the use of classification for problem aggregation and size reduction, when managers need to perform efficient, yet extensive, and dependable what-if analyses related to inventory management.

AB  - Hedonic valuation models enable us to make relevant decisions concerning the equipage of the built environment amenities and to establish more correct price zoning and land use management. These studies examining the utilitarian and hedonic aspects of property often face issues: how can we measure and assess multisensory experiences of property buyers (their affective attitudes, emotional states and physiological parameters) in an integrated manner and make a decision? This fact was a vital goal of the integrated Neutrosophic Degree of Project Utility and Investment Value Assessments along with Recommendation Provisions (INVAR) method. About 200 million multisensory data points have been collected so far and, as a result of their correlation analysis, several tens of thousands of average and robust correlations were determined. The new Neutrosophic INVAR method offers a bigger, more detailed picture of the hedonic-utilitarian value of the property. Another benefit of the Neutrosophic INVAR method is its ability to assist in assessing any project, determining its integrated hedonic-utilitarian value and offering tips on ways to make the project better. The Neutrosophic INVAR method can also optimise any criterion of your choice to make a specific project as competitive in the market and can determine the value that would propel the project to the top among the projects discussed. The analysis performed in this research is the basis for asserting that a sustainable development policy for housing and a surrounding environment is only possible by analysing the two-way process of interactions between a built environment and its neighbourhood residents in an integrated manner.

AB  - An effective hybrid optimization method is proposed by integrating an adaptive Kriging (A-Kriging) into an improved partial swarm optimization algorithm (IPSO) to give a so-called A-Kriging-IPSO for maximizing the buckling load of laminated composite plates (LCPs) under uniaxial and biaxial compressions. In this method, a novel iterative adaptive Kriging model, which is structured using two training sample sets as active and adaptive points, is utilized to directly predict the buckling load of the LCPs and to improve the efficiency of the optimization process. The active points are selected from the initial data set while the adaptive points are generated using the radial random-based convex samples. The cell-based smoothed discrete shear gap method (CS-DSG3) is employed to analyze the buckling behavior of the LCPs to provide the response of adaptive and input data sets. The buckling load of the LCPs is maximized by utilizing the IPSO algorithm. To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed methodology, the LCPs with different layers (2, 3, 4, and 10 layers), boundary conditions, aspect ratios and load patterns (biaxial and uniaxial loads) are investigated. The results obtained by proposed method are in good agreement with the literature results, but with less computational burden. By applying adaptive radial Kriging model, the accurate optimal results–based predictions of the buckling load are obtained for the studied LCPs.

AB  - In this study, three different tool pin geometries were studied for friction stir welding (FSW) of AA 6061-T6 to identify the best tool geometry in terms of the final weld properties. In this regard, tool rotational speed and tool traverse speed was assumed as input process parameters. In order to obtain the optimal values of process parameters that simultaneously optimize the ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, elongation and hardness, hybrid approach combining TOPSIS (Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) with PCA (principal component analysis) method is proposed. An analysis of these optimized results for each tool geometries shows the taper threaded tool provides the highest properties. A confirmation test was also carried out to verify the optimized parameter for all the tools and they are found to be within an acceptable limit. Further, more efficient torque and force behavior were obtained for the taper threaded tool.

Hereby, an intelligent access network selection algorithm based on multiple attribute decision making (MADM) is proposed in this paper. First, considering the special characteristics of cognitive wireless networks, a cross-layer network framework based on cognitive cycle was proposed. Secondly, according to network condition and QoE of users, we used the cross-layer multiple attributes to make decision for network selection. Lastly, simulation experiments were carried out using MATLAB. The simulation results show that the network selection algorithm was effective. The number of handoffs and sorting anomaly ratios were reduced. The quality of network service, user experience and network resource utilization were improved. Mobile users can access the most suitable network according to different traffic type requirements.

AB  - Dust storms are considered as one of the most important environmental challenges in the West Asia region. In addition to the harmful impacts of dust storms on human health, they also have particular effects on socioeconomic and agroecological domains of human communities. Identify the sources of dust storms is the first step to combat against these devastating phenomena. Accordingly, the present study was conducted to determine dust sources of the Tigris and Euphrates basin using satellite and climatic data. Monthly LST and NDVI of MODIS, monthly wind speed, soil moisture, and absolute air humidity data from GLDAS, monthly TRMM precipitation, and soil texture data of FAO were used. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model was applied to determine the weights of the collected data (i.e. criteria or drivers for dust storms formation). Susceptible Areas to Dust Storm Formation (SADSF) were determined using the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) model for months of June, July, and August from 2000 to 2017. After performing SADSF analysis, five main dust sources were identified in the whole basin. To evaluate the accuracy of the results, the number of real Observed Dust Storms (ODS) in each source was compared to the repetition of allocation in SADSF for each pixel over the 18-year period of this study from 2000 to 2017. Results indicated that the area of SADSF has significantly grown for all three months since 2008. The areas of SADSF in June and July were almost the same, while they were significantly bigger than August. Among identified dust sources, the highest SADSF repetition was in the northwest of Iraq followed by eastern Syria, southern Iraq, southeast border of Iraq, and east border of Iraq, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the SADSF repetition with the number of ODS events in those recognized dust sources was equal to 0.88, 0.76, and 0.74 for June, July, and August, respectively, that shows the accuracy of our results in comparison to actual data.

AB  - In the recent years, data-intensive applications have been growing at an increasing rate and there is a critical need to solve the high-performance and scalability issues. Hybrid Cloud Computing paradigm provides a promising solution to harness local infrastructure and remote resources and provide high Quality of Service (QoS) for time sensitive and data-intensive applications. Generally, hybrid cloud deployments have a heterogeneous pool of resources and it becomes a challenging task to efficiently utilize resources to provide optimum results. In modern data hungry applications, it is crucial to optimize bandwidth consumption, latency and networking overheads. Moreover, most of them have large extent of file sharing capability. The existing algorithms do not explicitly consider file sharing scenarios that leads large data transmission times and has severe effects on latency. In this direction, this paper focuses on building upon existing dynamic resource provisioning and task scheduling algorithms to provide better QoS in hybrid cloud environments for data intensive applications in a shared file task environment. The efficiency of proposed algorithms is demonstrated by deploying them on Microsoft Azure using Aneka, a platform for developing scalable applications on the Cloud. Experiments using real-world applications and datasets show that proposed algorithms are able to allocate tasks and extend to public cloud resources more efficiently, reducing deadline violations and improving response times to give response time reduction of upto 40.12% for a sample local alignment search application on genome sequences.

AB  - The shock wave/boundary-layer interaction is a common phenomenon, and it occurs in the internal and external flow fields of the hypersonic vehicle. Then, the separation, the oscillatory flow structures, the heat transfer localization and the pressure loads would be induced accordingly. In this survey, recent advances on the shock wave/boundary-layer interaction and its control in the internal and external flow fields were summarized, and it is obvious that the micro-vortex generator has been widely used in both the internal and external flow fields to suppress the separation induced by the shock wave/boundary-layer interaction, and the quantitative measurement and assessment approaches should be developed. At the same time, the intelligent control approach should be combined with the flexible surface to fit the variation of the incoming boundary conditions. With the development of the hypersonic flight technique, the requirement of the wind tunnel with high Mach number is urgent, as well as its test time. At the same time, the Monte Carlo method is required to obtain the shock wave/boundary-layer interaction properties in the high Mach number.

AB  - In order to identify and eliminate known or potential failures from the process of product design, development and production, failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) have been widely used in a variety of industries as a useful tool in prognostics and health management, safety and reliability analysis. The traditional FMEA shows two significant flaws while calculating the risk priority number (RPN). First, recovery time that considerably affects the safety, cost, and sustainability of the system is not considered in the RPN calculation. Second, in order to capture different conflicting experts’ views, especially when the obtained data are fuzzy, there is no mechanism. In order to overcome these issues, this paper presents a resilience-based risk priority number for considering the recovery and repair time of each failure mode, then a risk-based fuzzy information processing and decision-making is developed by modifying the R-numbers methodology and on the basis of simultaneous evaluation of criteria and alternatives (SECA) approach which is so-called R-SECA method. The capability of proposed models is tested by a case study of a centrifugal air compressor in a steel manufacturing company. Results show the robustness of proposed R-SECA model in dealing with different scenarios of risky information.

AB  - This study presents an improvement to the mean-variance portfolio optimization model, by considering both the integer transaction lots and a robust estimator of the covariance matrices. Four robust estimators were tested, namely the Minimum Covariance Determinant, the S, the MM, and the Orthogonalized Gnanadesikan–Kettenring estimator. These integer optimization problems were solved using genetic algorithms. We introduce the lot turnover measure, a modified portfolio turnover, and the Robust Sharpe Ratio as the measure of portfolio performance. Based on the simulation studies and the empirical results, this study shows that the robust estimators outperform the classical MLE when data contain outliers and when the lots have moderate sizes, e.g. 500 shares or less per lot.

AB  - Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has become a popular research topic among scholars as evidence suggests it has significantly contributed to achieve more environmentally conscious and socially responsible supply chains. Operational excellence (OE), on the other hand, can be achieved by incorporating SSCM practices within existing supply chain operations. However, due to human expertise, involvement and commitment towards excelling at sustainable and operational performance, the effective deployment of SSCM practices now depends on various human-based behavioral factors (BFs). Human behavior is dynamic in nature and hence has an effect on the implementation of SSCM practices. Nevertheless, research on BFs in view of SSCM practices is limited. To fill this knowledge gap, this study examines the nature of BFs for SSCM practices towards OE in supply chains, particularly within the context of the footwear industry of Bangladesh. In the first phase, the BFs were identified and determined through a literature review and empirical investigation. In the second phase, the Hesitant Fuzzy DEMATEL method was used to establish the cause-effect relationships among the factors. The influence of group validation by experts and a literature survey, along with managerial implications, was discussed and explained in the third phase of the study. The results suggest that the factor, ‘organization culture’ is the most influencing behavioral factor, followed by ‘commitment from higher authority’. Both theoretical and practical contributions of the study are drawn from its findings, helping footwear industry managers to more effectively adopt SSCM practices in the supply chain operations of their organizations to achieve OE.

AB  - Wireless communication on the Internet of Things (IoT) requires context-aware data transmission protocols. Developing an energy-efficient clustering mechanism is the primary challenge in data transmission over IoT. The existing approaches struggle with the short lifetime of IoT, imbalance load distribution, and high transmission delay. This paper proposes a novel cluster-head selection and clustering mechanism on IoT. It is composed of two main phases. The first phase selects the near-optimal cluster-heads using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. Performance criteria include the residual energy of the devices, the number of neighbors, Euclidean distance between devices and the sink, and Euclidean distance between each device and its neighbors. The principal objective of the second phase is to group devices into some clusters based on Euclidean distance between each cluster-head and its members, and the data volume generated by clusters. Simulation results verify that our mechanism improves energy consumption, lifetime, and transmission delay.

AB  - Research attention on decentralized autonomous energy systems has increased exponentially in the past three decades, as demonstrated by the absolute number of publications and the share of these studies in the corpus of energy system modelling literature. This paper shows the status quo and future modelling needs for research on local autonomous energy systems. A total of 359 studies are investigated, of which a subset of 123 in detail. The studies are assessed with respect to the characteristics of their methodology and applications, in order to derive common trends and insights. Most case studies apply to middle-income countries and only focus on the supply of electricity in the residential sector. Furthermore, many of the studies are comparable regarding objectives and applied methods. Local energy autonomy is associated with high costs, leading to levelized costs of electricity of 0.41 $/kWh on average. By analysing the studies, many improvements for future studies could be identified: the studies lack an analysis of the impact of autonomous energy systems on surrounding energy systems. In addition, the robust design of autonomous energy systems requires higher time resolutions and extreme conditions. Future research should also develop methodologies to consider local stakeholders and their preferences for energy systems.

KW  - Preference learning
KW  - Preference inference
AB  - One natural way to express preferences over items is to represent them in the form of pairwise comparisons, from which a model is learned in order to predict further preferences. In this setting, if an item a is preferred to the item b, then it is natural to consider that the preference still holds after multiplying both vectors by a positive scalar (e.g., 2a≻2b). Such invariance to scaling is satisfied in maximum margin learning approaches for pairs of test vectors, but not for the preference input pairs, i.e., scaling the inputs in a different way could result in a different preference relation being learned. In addition to the scaling of preference inputs, maximum margin methods are also sensitive to the way used for normalizing (scaling) the features, which is an essential pre-processing phase for these methods. In this paper, we define and analyse more cautious preference relations that are invariant to the scaling of features, or preference inputs, or both simultaneously; this leads to computational methods for testing dominance with respect to the induced relations, and for generating optimal solutions (i.e., best items) among a set of alternatives. In our experiments, we compare the relations and their associated optimality sets based on their decisiveness, computation time and cardinality of the optimal set.

AB  - This review on current US municipal solid waste-to-energy trends highlighted regional contrasts on technology adoption, unique challenges of each technology, commonly used decision support tools, and major operators. In US only 13% of MSW is used for energy recovery and 53% is landfilled. There are 86 WTE facilities that mostly use Mass-Burn and Refuse-Derived Fuel technologies and are concentrated in densely populated northeast (predominantly in New York) and the State of Florida. For the rest of the country most of the MSW ends up in landfills equipped with gas recovery, which is supplied to homes or used for electricity generation. However, there are many pilot and experimental systems based on advanced gasification and pyrolysis processes, which are viewed as potential technologies to respond to an issue of landfills nearing full capacity in various US states. These systems are viewed as “cleaner” (65% less toxic residue) than established mass burn technologies but not matured to commercialization due technical and cost hurdles. Operation and maintenance costs between $40-$100 per ton of MSW were reported for gasification systems. The heterogeneous nature of MSW, gas cleaning and air pollution controls are the main disadvantages. Key design and decision support tools used by the scientific community and major operators in US include: Techno-economic analysis, Life cycle sustainability assessment, and Reverse logistics modeling. A conclusion drawn from reviewed studies is that adoption of thermal WTE technologies in US could continue to increase, albeit slowly, in coastal and urban areas lacking suitable lands for new landfills.

AB  - This paper examines barriers to the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies in the manufacturing sector in the context of both developed and developing economies. A comprehensive literature review, followed by discussions with industry experts, identifies 15 barriers, which are analyzed by means of a Grey Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach. The ‘lack of a digital strategy alongside resource scarcity’ emerges as the most prominent barrier in both developed and developing economies. The influencing barriers identified suggest that improvements in standards and government regulation could facilitate the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in developing country case, whereas technological infrastructure is needed to promote the adoption of these technologies in developed country case. This study is one of the first to examine the implementation of Industry 4.0 in both developing and developed economies. This article highlights the difficulties in the diffusion of technological innovation resulting from a lack of coordinated national policies on Industry 4.0 in developing countries, which may prevent firms from fully experiencing the Industry 4.0 revolution. The results of this study may help decision makers and practitioners to address the barriers highlighted, paving the way for successful implementation of Industry 4.0 across the manufacturing sector.

AB  - Due to numerous uncertainties such as bad weather conditions, frequent changes in the schedules of vessels, breakdowns of equipment, port managers are aiming at providing adaptive and flexible strategic planning of their facilities, especially intermodal terminals. In this research, we investigate a two-stage optimization of intermodal terminals main parameters via using AnyLogic simulation platform. We have developed a set of hybrid simulation models to optimize the main parameters of intermodal terminals which are also called dry ports. To make an express evaluation of the preliminary implementation of dry ports, we have developed an agent-based system dynamics simulation model to achieve the stable state of the main parameters of intermodal terminals. To clarify the obtained averaged benefits of the main dry ports parameters while the port managers make key decisions on the investments into implementation of intermodal terminals, we have developed an agent-based discrete-event simulation model of a seaport – a dry port system. We show that the combination of the agent-based modeling with other simulation approaches simplifies the process of designing simulation models and increases their visibility. The developed set of models allows us to compute the balanced values of the parameters, while an effective operation of a seaport – intermodal terminal system is achieved. On the basis of the provided case study on one of the busiest ports in China, we prove the adequacy and validity of the developed simulation models. Due to the lack of systematic approach to optimization of the main parameters of intermodal terminals in logistic industry, our findings set herein could improve the decision-making process related to the selection of strategic facility planning in the field of intermodal terminals.

AB  - Historically performance of city services has mostly been evaluated from a performability perspective based on what is commonly understood as a quality of service (QoS) analysis. High values of QoS are generally perceived by systems owners as reflective of a high quality of experience (QoE) by the system users. Unfortunately, such a statement is many times untrue. There is a lack of connection between the user experience and the system performance. As such, and given the availability of social media data regarding the usage of services and experiences, this work presents a novel framework to bring together QoS and QoE analyses, to integrate performance metrics with user expectations of services. This framework is illustrated via the bicycle sharing program of New York City, Citibike, where the combination of both QoS and QoE provides insights into a variety of issues related to the city and the service itself.

AB  - This paper applies resilience theory in safety management to three subway construction sites: the Shuangzhai, the Sports Centre and the Sanyizhuang stations on the Xi'an Metro Line 14. It analyses the resilience connotation and evaluates the system resilience using the resilience index. The Delphi method determined the resilience indices. The ANP extension cloud synthesis was constructed combining the cloud and matter-element extension theories to address the randomness and ambiguity of the resilience assessment process for subway construction sites. This study reveals that the resilience level was consistent with actual engineering project assessment at all stations. The resilience assessment of the Shuangzhai Station project ranks first followed by that of Sanyizhuang and then the Sports Centre station. The findings of this study argue for strengthening the resilience management, taking measures to optimise and improve the security system, enhancing the defence ability and anti-risk mechanism at the construction sites of the sports centre and the Sanyizhuang stations.

AB  - Sustainable cities are widely adopting the standards of the Internet of Things (IoT) in almost every domain, e.g., smart grids (SG) to provide services to a sustainable community. It enables two-way communication to manage the energy resources, where routing protocol has a significant role in communication. The diversification of IoT networks arises many challenges for the routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL). The dynamic and lossy environment is one of the key challenges in various IoT networks, specifically SG. RPL does not able to adjust its link metric efficiently against the dynamic and lossy environment, which have a great impact on the performance metrics. To address this issue, we have introduced cognition in RPL by integrating learning automata with the objective function (LA-OF). Learning automata (LA) is applied to expected transmission count (ETX) to tune it according to the environment. LA learns through interacting with the environment and yields the best ETX values, afterwards the environment is monitored to trace down the instability in the environment. The proposed LA-OF is compared with standardized techniques MRHOF and OF0. The simulation results show a significant improvement with overall 7.04% in PRR, 17.52% in energy consumption, and 18.72% in overhead.

AB  - Growing awareness about the environmental and social issues and pressure from all stakeholders has forced industries to adopt sustainability practices in their supply chains. Suppliers contribute significantly to establishing an effective sustainable supply chain. Hence industries need to evaluate its potential suppliers precisely on sustainability criteria. In this work, a two-phase decision model using Fuzzy Interference System (FIS) along with Fuzzy Kano philosophy for the sustainable environment has been proposed to select sustainable suppliers for a large scale industry. In the first phase, sustainability criteria clustering using fuzzy Kano model has been performed for the identification of ‘Must-be’ criteria in economic, environmental and social dimensions. Further, sub-criteria with quantified evaluation levels for Must-be criteria have been established. In the second phase, the three distinct Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) has been developed for evaluating the Sustainability Performance Index (SPI) values of each supplier in three sustainability dimensions. In FIS, the architecture of each model is modified in such a way that each FIS engine have to compute the minimum number of rules. Finally, weights are assigned to SPI in each dimension, and suppliers are ranked for final selection. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed decision framework. A sustainable supplier selection problem of the iron and steel industry of India has been investigated to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed decision framework.

The number of published papers within the domain of sustainable supplier selection has grown considerably in recent years. Up until now, there has been no attempt quantitatively analyze the content of these published papers using bibliometric and network analysis software. Thus, this paper utilizes Gephi and Bibexcel software to conduct a quantitative review. In total, 4,882 documents were reviewed based on 336 combinations searched in Scopus and the Web of Science from 1990 to March 2018. Bibliometric, co-word and co-citation analysis are applied to quantitatively extract and analyze the content of these papers. The analysis reveals that: 1) There is a gap between industry and academia that needs to be bridged; 2) More studies in the area of global sourcing are needed; 3) Comparing the outcomes of different supplier evaluation methods is required; 4) There has been no major shift or change in the traditional supplier selection practices; 5) The ratio of the applied social criteria is relatively low compared to the total number of criteria; 6) The innovation capability of suppliers needs to be further considered; 7) More studies of sustainable supplier selection are needed in the e-procurement arena, as well as service-based industries such as healthcare, and 8) Evaluating the sustainability of suppliers in a dynamic environment needs to be further studied. The conclusion also reveals that only a limited number of journals exhibit a specific focus on the sustainable supplier selection arena; analytical and mathematical-based methods are the most applied supplier selection tools and there is a misalignment between the applied criteria in the triple bottom line.

AB  - An existing industrial building ubicated in South Italy is investigated by applying a tailored approach to optimize energy retrofit. The baseline provides high energy consumption, which needs to be tackled to promote the transition towards more sustainable buildings. Accordingly, after a detailed energy audit, the building is modeled and simulated under EnergyPlus environment using DesignBuilder® to characterize geometry and HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) systems. The model is calibrated against metered data as concerns the trends of indoor temperatures. Different retrofit measures are investigated, i.e., replacement of windows, implementation of solar screens, use of heat recovery, optimization of HVAC operation and installation of photovoltaics of different sizes. Thus, a large domain of solutions is explored by conducting an exhaustive research through the coupling between EnergyPlus and MATLAB®. The research provides the Pareto optimization of building retrofit minimizing primary energy consumption and global cost for two different scenarios as regards the access to public incentives. The utopia point criterion is used to pick a solution from the Pareto front. Such solution can yield energy and global cost savings up to 81% and 45%, respectively, ensuring the same comfort level compared to the baseline. The primary energy consumption of the whole facility can be reduced up to 40.1 kWhp/m2a. The outcomes can give precious guidelines to refurbish industrial and office buildings in Mediterranean areas with a view to energy-efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

AB  - Quality assurance and evaluation has always been a key cause of concern for software developers. This problem has been further aggravated by the complete dependence of business enterprises, financial institutions and stock markets on computer hardware and software. It is therefore needed to propose and develop such software evaluation and quality assurance techniques that can fit into the business model’s domain and satisfy the customer needs and aspirations. Autonomic computation is an artificial intelligent based approach used to design and develop software systems which can fit into business model and also satisfy customer needs. These systems are built with self-managed policy system. To guarantee their customers a Total Quality Assurance on the business applications being developed, the paper presents some key aspects of domain-specific software and its quality estimation parameter. In this paper, the authors have analyzed the various aspects of quality metrics of autonomic computation suggested by enhanced ISO 9126 quality model. A universally acceptable approach to assure quality for autonomic computing system would be to measure the Autonomicity of a system to determine whether it is autonomic or not. If it is autonomic then “to what extent” is the next question? Autonomicity is an excellent indicator to assure quality of the autonomic software. The approach taken to measure the subjective attribute of Autonomicity is fuzzy theory with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) integrated in it. Human assessment is qualitative and fuzzy technique is best candidate to quantify their opinions. For empirical analysis, three different query optimizers are examined to measure autonomicity. The result of the empirical analysis will be validated using the already proposed results of the research studies. The present study will provide a base for further research in terms of development of applications with autonomic features. It will also help in proposing new metrics for quality characteristics to estimate the overall quality of such application.

AB  - Mapping and managing groundwater resources are essential for socio-economic and sustainable development. Analysis of hydrogeochemical parameters of the groundwater for the Lower Ganga basin is presented to identify the contamination zones and also to understand the groundwater quality in this region. Drainage pattern analysis identifies five sub-basins in the region. Shannon’s entropy information theory has been performed to compute the water quality index (WQI) without having any subjective bias in the analysis. The analysis of the WQI shows that sub-basin 2 (WQI = 38.35) has excellent quality of groundwater, whereas sub-basin 1 (WQI = 52.43), 3 (WQI = 63.94), and 5 (WQI = 82.79) are having good groundwater quality. On the other hand, sub-basin 4 (WQI = 102.99), which covers mostly the central part of the main stream, is found to be most contaminated and having a medium quality of the groundwater. Analysis of the groundwater parameters using the PCA indicates that the quality of groundwater in the study area is controlled mainly by three main factors, which are geogenic process (weathering and leaching of rocks), seawater intrusion (natural process), and anthropogenic activities. Furthermore, hydrometeorological analysis shows a gradual drop in precipitation, water level depth, and the percolation index (PI). This indicates an over exploitation of groundwater resources in the study region under the present circumstances of climate variability, population and industrialization. The results obtained in this paper are useful for identifying suitable sites for tube-wells and bore-wells for drinking and agricultural purposes, and also for developing an effective strategy to avoid further contamination of groundwater aquifers in the region. Results are extremely useful for government agencies and policymakers in achieving the United Nations (SDG-6) goals of suitable planning and sustainable development of groundwater resources by 2030.

AB  - Smart farming is the evolution of precision agriculture, it is based on Internet of Things (IoT), this term was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 and it represents data collected from objects or ‘things’, (e.g., devices, implements, sensors) and processed individually or together with algorithms that correlate the information to help the users to take decisions not based only on position, as is in precision agriculture, but also on data ‘enhanced by context and situation awareness, triggered by real-time events’ (Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart farming in Africa was hindered by development of ICT systems around the region. Recent initiatives such as Last Mile Project and other projects that connect sub-Saharan Africa to the world Internet have sparked researchers and other stakeholders in agriculture to make a move on digital agriculture and smart farming in general. These efforts will go so high when Internet costs goes down and becomes accessible to most of the farmers. Farmers in Africa are willing to adopt any technology that would simplify their daily economic activities. That is why mobile money using phones is so popular in Africa and very useful among farming communities.

AB  - Managing ecotourism through appropriate zoning is critical for land use planning. This study is the first to integrate a geographic information system (GIS) with a Fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) to evaluate the relative importance of physical, natural, environmental, and socio-economic factors for determining the suitability of ecotourism sites. Eleven factors were selected through questionnaire-based surveying of 35 ecotourism and land management experts. F-AHP was applied to weight these factors in order to index and map the suitability of an Iranian case study area for ecotourism using GIS data. A reliable model for the identification of zone suitability was developed which revealed that landform and distance to stream, followed by temperature and elevation were the most important factors for calculating the suitability index. This paper provides useful insights into this novel application of a GIS-based F-AHP for ecotourism planning relevant for policy-makers, planners and practitioners.

AB  - Penetration rates of intermittent renewables increase in smart grid due to environmental issues. As a significant part of smart grid, distributed microgrids (DMGs) have huge application prospects for its flexibility, high efficiency and fast recovery ability. In order to improve the effective penetration of renewable energy in distributed microgrids at low cost, we proposed a dynamic model-based configuration and scheduling coupling optimization method in this study. We established the multi-domain joint simulation model for DMGs based on the Modelica acausal modeling language to realize the coupling of distributed generation (DG), energy conversion/storage components and user loads with multiscale time-varying characteristics, and validated its accuracy by using the measured data. On the basis of the model established above, branch and bound method and meta-heuristic algorithm are used to optimize the double layer configuration and scheduling of microgrids in four typical scenarios. Moreover, a novel evaluating indicator, the effective penetration of renewable energy (EPRE), is proposed to improve the system self-utilization rate of renewable energy. Study results show that by using the newly developed model-based optimization method with the new indicator, the self-utilization rate in DMGs can be increased up to 58.05% and the average daily interactive power of electricity fed back to the regional grid is reduced significantly.

AB  - Choosing a suitable supplier is one of the crucial issues in supply chain management, gaining much attention in the light of disrupted balances between cost-time-quality interactions in developed/developing countries in these past years. In the meantime, the supplier selection with considering resilient criteria is the new topic in this area. Resilient may be defined as sufficient flexibility in counteracting fluctuations. This study presents a new integrated efficiency measurement model combining statistical techniques, decision making, and mathematical programming for resilient supplier analysis. Also, a new combination of two methods of first aggregation and last aggregation is developed to take advantage of both. Methodologically, this paper applies principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions and the correlation between the criteria. The PCA method is utilized to decrease the dimensions and the correlation between the criteria. Besides, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is employed to determine the weights of the criteria and ranking the suppliers. Weights of the criteria are established using the DEA method, the entropy, and judgments of decision-makers (DMs) simultaneously. A case study of resilient supplier selection problems is resolved and compared with existing methods to prove the performance of the proposed model. As a way of calculating the weight of the criteria, this study analyzes the performance of the proposed method and compare it with the first and last aggregation approaches. Then, the results of the study are reported.

AB  - Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is one of the important modalities of the next generation of new energy vehicles. As the basic infrastructure of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) have drawn attention from all social circles. However, hindered by various barriers, the development of HRSs is much slower than the Chinese government's expectation. Hence, this study aims to explore critical barriers of the HRS development in China based on a modified fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Firstly, a barrier list is identified through a literature survey and expert consultation, which consists of four categories (economic, technological, social and political-regulatory aspect) and 12 potential barriers. Later, considering the subjectivity of threshold setting in the traditional fuzzy DEMATEL method, the K-means clustering algorithm is utilized to optimize the threshold value, and thus a modified fuzzy DEMATEL approach is proposed to investigate the prominence of these barriers and the cause-effect relationships among them. The results show that six barriers are regarded as key barriers to China's HRS development, and corresponding policy measures are formulated to mitigate or eliminate these critical barriers.

AB  - The development of sustainable products and processes has recently gained wide interest in the chemical industry. Here, we review the application of the life cycle optimization framework to chemical systems, where the key idea is to combine life cycle assessment (LCA) with multiobjective optimization (MOO) so as to identify solutions attaining simultaneously economic and environmental benefits. We introduce the fundamentals of this method and highlight its capabilities in three examples at various spatial and temporal scales, i.e., the sustainable design of hydrogen supply chains and process flowsheets and the environmental assessment of chemicals. We argue that the combined use of MOO and LCA will play a key role in the transition to a more sustainable chemical industry, yet we identify methodological and practical issues that still need to be resolved for its widespread use in industry.

AB  - Monitoring agricultural land cover is highly relevant for global early warning systems such as ASAP (Anomaly hot Spots of Agricultural Production), because it represents the basis for detecting production deficits in food security assessment. Given the significant inconsistencies among existing land cover datasets, there is a need to obtain a more accurate representation of the spatial distribution and extent of agricultural area in Africa. In this research, we explore a fusion approach that combines the strength of individual datasets and minimises their limitations. Specifically, a semi-automatic method is developed, relying on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) complemented with manual fine-tuning using the best-rated datasets, to generate two hybrid and static agricultural masks – one for cropland and another for grassland. Following a comprehensive selection of land cover maps, each dataset is evaluated at country level according to five criteria: timeliness, spatial resolution, comparison with FAO statistics, accuracy assessment and expert evaluation. A sensitivity analysis is performed, based on an evaluation of the impact of weight settings on the resulting land cover. The proposed methodology is capable of improving agricultural characterisation in Africa. As a result, two static masks at 250 m spatial resolution for the nominal year 2016 are provided.
