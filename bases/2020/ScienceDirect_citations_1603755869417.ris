AB  - The diagnosed features (samples) with multiple attributes of medical images always demand experts to reveal insight. Up to today, machine learning often cannot be a helpful expert. The reason lies in lacking evidential granules carrying knowledge and evidence for inferential learning. The shortage slows down representation learning which aims at discovering expressions for featuring concepts. Therefore, this paper proposes evidential memberships carrying preferential relevance to build a heuristic representation learning. Empirically, it solves local features and global representations with maximum coverage under challenges of shallow bury. For illustration, it is implemented on the testing data set of UCI-SPECTF.

AB  - Urban planners, local authorities, and energy policymakers often develop strategic sustainable energy plans for the urban building stock in order to minimize overall energy consumption and emissions. Planning at such scales could be informed by building stock modeling using existing building data and Geographic Information System-based mapping. However, implementing these processes involves several issues, namely, data availability, data inconsistency, data scalability, data integration, geocoding, and data privacy. This research addresses the aforementioned information challenges by proposing a generalized integrated methodology that implements bottom-up, data-driven, and spatial modeling approaches for multi-scale Geographic Information System mapping of building energy modeling. This study uses the Irish building stock to map building energy performance at multiple scales. The generalized data-driven methodology uses approximately 650,000 Irish Energy Performance Certificates buildings data to predict more than 2 million buildings’ energy performance. In this case, the approach delivers a prediction accuracy of 88% using deep learning algorithms. These prediction results are then used for spatial modeling at multiple scales from the individual building level to a national level. Furthermore, these maps are coupled with available spatial resources (social, economic, or environmental data) for energy planning, analysis, and support decision-making. The modeling results identify clusters of buildings that have a significant potential for energy savings within any specific region. Geographic Information System-based modeling aids stakeholders in identifying priority areas for implementing energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, the stakeholders could target local communities for retrofit campaigns, which would enhance the implementation of sustainable energy policy decisions.

AB  - Check dams are considered to be one of the most effective measures for conservation of the soil and water resources. However, identifying the most suitable sites for the installation of check dams remain quite demanding. This research investigates and compares five machine learning algorithms (MLAs) – boosted regression trees (BRT), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), mixture discriminant analysis (MDA), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) – for generating check-dam site-suitability maps (CDSSMs) and assessing them in Firuzkuh County, Iran. First, the locations of 475 existing check dams were monitored, registered, and divided into calibration (70%) and testing datasets (30%) for training and validation of the models. Fourteen check-dam conditioning factors (CDCFs) were selected and checked for multicollinearity. The relative importance of the CDCFs assessed using the elastic net (ENET) algorithm. Results demonstrated that distance from river (DFR) and drainage density (DD) to be the most significant factors for mapping the suitable sites for the erection of check dams. This research revealed that all of five MLAs had excellent accuracy for predicting the check-dam site-suitability with high AUC values: RF (0.966), SVM (0.878), MARS (0.878), MDA (0.844), and BRT (0.843). The most accurate model (RF) showed that 16.95%, 35.55%, 31.08%, and 16.42% of study area comes under low, moderate, high, and very high suitability classes. The outcome achieved by this research will be helpful to sustainability planners and managers in constructing check dams at suitable sites for better conservation of soil and water resources.

AB  - Soil is a key component of Earth's critical zone. It provides essential services for agricultural production, plant growth, animal habitation, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and environmental quality, which are crucial for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, soil degradation has occurred in many places throughout the world due to factors such as soil pollution, erosion, salinization, and acidification. In order to achieve the SDGs by the target date of 2030, soils may need to be used and managed in a manner that is more sustainable than is currently practiced. Here we show that research in the field of sustainable soil use and management should prioritize the multifunctional value of soil health and address interdisciplinary linkages with major issues such as biodiversity and climate change. As soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, as well as a significant contributor of greenhouse gases, much progress can be made toward curtailing the climate crisis by sustainable soil management practices. One identified option is to increase soil organic carbon levels, especially with recalcitrant forms of carbon (e.g., biochar application). In general, soil health is primarily determined by the actions of the farming community. Therefore, information management and knowledge sharing are necessary to improve the sustainable behavior of practitioners and end-users. Scientists and policy makers are important actors in this social learning process, not only to disseminate evidence-based scientific knowledge, but also in generating new knowledge in close collaboration with farmers. While governmental funding for soil data collection has been generally decreasing, newly available 5G telecommunications, big data and machine learning based data collection and analytical tools are maturing. Interdisciplinary studies that incorporate such advances may lead to the formation of innovative sustainable soil use and management strategies that are aimed toward optimizing soil health and achieving the SDGs.

AB  - East Kolkata Wetland (EKW) is a Ramsar site located adjacent to the Kolkata megacity. EKW is one of the resourceful wetland ecosystems of the world which offers a bundle of direct and indirect ecosystem services to the Kolkata megacity region. The rapid expansion of built-up in the surrounding urban agglomeration of the EKW is putting immense pressure on the EKW and the rate of wetland loss has been highest in recent decades. To ensure that this distinct ecosystem is conserved, an efficient means of identifying wetland conversion risk is needed. This study aims to assess the risk of EKW conversion using two advanced data-driven Machine Learning (ML) models, viz, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The novelty of the paper is in the fact that ML models have been widely applied to groundwater potential, flood susceptibility, and landslide susceptibility, their applicability to wetland conversion risk assessment has not yet been explored. The advantage of RF and SVM is that both of the ML models can overcome the limitations of pre-assumption based conventional methods of wetland risk assessment. A total of eight factors are selected which can be categorized into ecological, bio-physical, demographic, and physical infrastructure groups. Both results indicate that around 60% area under medium to very high-risk zones. A comparison is also made between these two methods to identify the most precise prediction method for this study area. The results of the models are quantitatively validated applying the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) method, where both of this method identifies SVM as a more precise predictive model for this study with 91.12% accuracy. The spatial pattern of encroachment and shrinkage of EKW triggered by urban expansion is successfully captured by RF and ME. Policy analysts and land-use planners can use the outcome derived from RF and SVM models and associated maps to identify the risk zones, assess the effectiveness of wetland conservation programs, design effective policies to stop further degradation of the wetlands, and adopt long-term sustainable planning for this precious ecosystem.

AB  - Realistic performance predictions are required for efficient operation strategy of air conditioners. In this study, the application of a cost effective and non-intrusive black box model utilizing artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the cooling capacity of air conditioning systems is investigated, while considering the effect of fouling and leakage that may occur after prolonged operation. The effect of various leakage and fouling combinations on the output cooling capacity were numerically simulated. The training data set is first generated for a system that is ideally operating without any fouling or leakage. The developed ANN model is tested to predict cooling capacity in “faulty” systems. The results indicated that, as long as leakage and fouling are limited below 10% and 4% respectively, the ANN model trained by the data generated with the ideal system, can predict cooling capacity with a relative averaged cooling capacity difference (ΔQ-e,rel) of approximately 13%. Moreover, the inclusion of data with different leakage and fouling combinations in the training set enables accurate predictions of the cooling capacity of the air conditioning system during the entire timespan of its operation. It suggests that cooling capacity under the fouling and leakage phenomena can be predicted using limited input information.

AB  - The Dolatabad chromite district, a well-endowed mineralized tract located in SE Iran, hosts numerous podiform chromite deposits. Its favorable geological setting and known chromite endowment suggest that the district has good potential for the discovery of additional chromite mineralization. However, the processes that controlled the development and preservation of the chromite ores are poorly known. As such, a better understanding of the ore-forming processes will be critical for the success of future exploration activities in the Dolatabad chromite district. Recognition of these critical genetic processes and the mapping of their spatial expressions are the precursors to mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) as well as any mineral exploration activities on the ground. This study adopted a mineral systems approach to MPM, which entailed the formulation of a probabilistic framework to the recognition of the critical genetic processes and translation of these processes to mappable evidence maps. Here, we developed three proxies, representing trap, deposition, and preservation processes, that were subjected to a range of weighting procedures, including continuous (i.e., fuzzy gamma, geometric average, and data-driven index overlay) and data-driven machine-learning (i.e., multilayer perceptron neural network and random forests) methods. The machine-learning procedures outperformed the continuous procedures, suggesting that the former approaches are more reliable in targeting mineralized zones. The targets delineated by random forest algorithm, the superior model generated in this study, predicted c. 71% of the known chromite mineralization in c. 6% of the study area.

AB  - In-situ measurements of the viscosity and density of small volumes of liquids are required in several industrial applications. MEMS sensors deploying vibrating microstructures constitute an attractive alternative given the significant impact of the surrounding liquid on their dynamic behavior. In this work, we combine physics-based modeling approaches and deep learning techniques to simultaneously estimate the density and viscosity of liquids from the resonance frequencies and quality factors of immersed microcantilevers. The physics-based model is first validated by comparing the simulated resonance frequencies and quality factors of immersed microcantilevers to those obtained from experiments conducted on a large variety of liquids. Then, we use the simulations results to train deep neutral networks to learn the mapping from the data space to the parameter space. The deep learning method shows high prediction accuracy provided that there is enough independent input data, shows no bias in the predicted values, and provides the results instantaneously. The optimal accuracy in the estimation of the liquid viscosity and density is achieved when the first resonance frequency and corresponding quality factor are used as inputs.

Joining is a key manufacturing process and historically was a paper-based process with incomplete variety documentation. Nowadays, digital joining element design is a substitution of paper for 3D space. Nonetheless, it remains an ambiguous manual task with limited automation, resulting in time-consuming iterative error-prone development trajectories and costly reworks. This contribution addresses the state of the art in joining element design in both research and industry practice. It reviews product variety and its impact on joining processes. The paper identifies a need for integrating product variety into joining element design and it proposes a solution pathway using artificial intelligence methods.

AB  - With the increasing demands on businesses to operate more sustainably, firms must ensure that the performance of their whole supply chain in sustainability is optimized. Because partner selection is critical to supply chain management, focal firms now need to select supply chains partners that can offer a high level of competence in sustainability. This paper proposes a novel multi-partner classification model for the partner qualification and classification process, combining ensemble learning technology and fuzzy set theory. The proposed model enables potential partners to be classified into one of four categories (strategic partner, preference partner, leverage partner and routine partner), thereby allowing distinctive partner management strategies to be applied for each category. The model provides for the simultaneous optimization of both efficiency in its use of multi-partner and multi-dimension evaluation data, and effectiveness in dealing with the vagueness and uncertainty of linguistic commentary data, in the partner evaluation process. Compared to more conventional methods, the proposed model has the advantage of offering a simple classification and a stable prediction performance. The practical efficacy of the model is illustrated by an application in a listed electronic equipment and instrument manufacturing company based in southeastern China.

The sustainability deviation in these renewable resources can be alarming not only for these financially weaker nations but also for the whole planet. In this study, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is presented for the sustainable performance improvement of the existing major hydropower station, generating forty eight percent of the hydroelectric power in a developing country. The problem is modeled using two different decision making tools to ensure the consistency and reliability of the results. ‘Predictive Maintenance’ has been identified as the most optimal alternative while ‘Training and Development’ has emerged as the second option. This clearly generates the need for adopting intelligent technologies coupled with the ‘State of the Art’ Trainings. Operational Agility and System Upgradation seem the least important options, mainly due to financial challenges faced by developing countries. The results, in terms of policy making, sustainability and future investments, are highly attractive for all the stakeholders including the plant crews, international investors, local government and international regulatory bodies.

In this study, we applied two novel deep learning algorithms, the recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), for national-scale landslide susceptibility mapping of Iran. We prepared a dataset comprising 4069 historical landslide locations and 11 conditioning factors (altitude, slope degree, profile curvature, distance to river, aspect, plan curvature, distance to road, distance to fault, rainfall, geology and land-sue) to construct a geospatial database and divided the data into the training and the testing dataset. We then developed RNN and CNN algorithms to generate landslide susceptibility maps of Iran using the training dataset. We calculated the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and used the area under the curve (AUC) for the quantitative evaluation of the landslide susceptibility maps using the testing dataset. Better performance in both the training and testing phases was provided by the RNN algorithm (AUC = 0.88) than by the CNN algorithm (AUC=0.85). Finally, we calculated areas of susceptibility for each province and found that 6% and 14% of the land area of Iran is very highly and highly susceptible to future landslide events, respectively, with the highest susceptibility in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province (33.8%). About 31% of cities of Iran are located in areas with high and very high landslide susceptibility. The results of the present study will be useful for the development of landslide hazard mitigation strategies.

AB  - The waste management processes typically involve numerous technical, climatic, environmental, demographic, socio-economic, and legislative parameters. Such complex nonlinear processes are challenging to model, predict and optimize using conventional methods. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have gained momentum in offering alternative computational approaches to solve solid waste management (SWM) problems. AI has been efficient at tackling ill-defined problems, learning from experience, and handling uncertainty and incomplete data. Although significant research was carried out in this domain, very few review studies have assessed the potential of AI in solving the diverse SWM problems. This systematic literature review compiled 85 research studies, published between 2004 and 2019, analyzing the application of AI in various SWM fields, including forecasting of waste characteristics, waste bin level detection, process parameters prediction, vehicle routing, and SWM planning. This review provides comprehensive analysis of the different AI models and techniques applied in SWM, application domains and reported performance parameters, as well as the software platforms used to implement such models. The challenges and insights of applying AI techniques in SWM are also discussed.

However, much attention of the use of operational research and analytical models in healthcare has been paid to the systematic level such as country or regional policy making or organisational issues. This paper proposes a model concerned with healthcare analytics at the individual level, which can predict human physical activity status from sequential lifelogging data collected from wearable sensors. The model has a two-stage hybrid structure (in short, MOGP-HMM) – a multi-objective genetic programming (MOGP) algorithm in the first stage to reduce the dimensions of lifelogging data and a hidden Markov model (HMM) in the second stage for activity status prediction over time. It can be used as a decision support tool to provide real-time monitoring, statistical analysis and personalized advice to individuals, encouraging positive attitudes towards healthy lifestyles. We validate the model with the real data collected from a group of participants in the UK, and compare it with other popular two-stage hybrid models. Our experimental results show that the MOGP-HMM can achieve comparable performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first study that uses the MOGP in the hybrid two-stage structure for individuals’ activity status prediction. It fits seamlessly with the current trend in the UK healthcare transformation of patient empowerment as well as contributing to a strategic development for more efficient and cost-effective provision of healthcare.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance has become one of the most important health problems and global action plans have been proposed globally. Prevention plays a key role in these actions plan and, in this context, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Time Series Forecasting techniques, for predicting future outbreaks of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Infection incidence forecasting is approached as a Feature Selection based Time Series Forecasting problem using multivariate time series composed of incidence of Staphylococcus aureus Methicillin-sensible and MRSA infections, influenza incidence and total days of therapy of both of Levofloxacin and Oseltamivir antimicrobials. Data were collected from the University Hospital of Getafe (Spain) from January 2009 to January 2018, using months as time granularity. The main contributions of the work are the following: the applications of wrapper feature selection methods where the search strategy is based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) along with evaluators based on the most powerful state-of-the-art regression algorithms. The performance of the feature selection methods has been measured using the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) performance metrics. A novel multi-criteria decision-making process is proposed in order to select the most satisfactory forecasting model, using the metrics previously mentioned, as well as the slopes of model prediction lines in the 1, 2 and 3 steps-ahead predictions. The multi-criteria decision-making process is applied to the best models resulting from a ranking of databases and regression algorithms obtained through multiple statistical tests. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a feature selection based multivariate time series methodology is proposed for antibiotic resistance forecasting. Final results show that the best model according to the proposed multi-criteria decision making process provides a RMSE = (0.1349, 0.1304, 0.1325) and a MAE = (0.1003, 0.096, 0.0987) for 1, 2, and 3 steps-ahead predictions.

AB  - Rotorcraft are commonly required to fly at low altitudes and this places them at a high risk of striking various types of obstacles. Wires, in particular, are very difficult to discern and easily blend in the background which explains why wire strikes are a major cause of helicopter accidents. In the context of helicopter operations, a wire hazard is any wire or structure supporting those wires that presents a danger to the aircraft. Data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) shows that wire strikes were responsible for 124 fatalities between 1994 and 2018. Data on civil helicopter wire strikes further show that the majority of helicopter models involved fall in the lightweight category. In this study, existing aircraft-mounted and ground-based wire strike prevention and protection technologies are reviewed, along with some other potential technologies that have not been specifically developed for use on helicopters but that might be able to prevent wire strikes. In particular, commercially available wire detection systems such as laser scanning systems, database-dependent warning systems, wire cutters, radar scanners and aerial markers are surveyed and evaluated against each other. Publicly available databases of transmission lines in the U.S. are identified and documented for the development of wire strike prevention technologies for lightweight helicopters. The feasibility of creating useful maps of wires from tabulated data or image data is discussed and various Electronic Flight Bag manufacturers are surveyed and compared to determine the feasibility of integrating and displaying such information in the cockpit. Challenges of implementing safety devices, in particular wire cutters, on lightweight helicopters are also discussed and recommendations are provided to improve helicopter wire strike safety. Finally, a multi-criteria decision-making analysis is carried out to rank wire strike safety devices and compare the robustness of their rankings with respect to various operator's preference scenarios. It is shown that the Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), the Wire Strike Protection System (WSPS), the Obstacle Collision Avoidance System (OCAS), and the wire markers perform best regardless of the scenario.

AB  - While the world has experience with many different types of infectious diseases, the current crisis related to the spread of COVID-19 has challenged epidemiologists and public health experts alike, leading to a rapid search for, and development of, new and innovative solutions to combat its spread. The transmission of this virus has infected more than 18.92 million people as of August 6, 2020, with over half a million deaths across the globe; the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared this a global pandemic. A multidisciplinary approach needs to be followed for diagnosis, treatment and tracking, especially between medical and computer sciences, so, a common ground is available to facilitate the research work at a faster pace. With this in mind, this survey paper aimed to explore and understand how and which different technological tools and techniques have been used within the context of COVID-19. The primary contribution of this paper is in its collation of the current state-of-the-art technological approaches applied to the context of COVID-19, and doing this in a holistic way, covering multiple disciplines and different perspectives. The analysis is widened by investigating Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches for the diagnosis, anticipate infection and mortality rate by tracing contacts and targeted drug designing. Moreover, the impact of different kinds of medical data used in diagnosis, prognosis and pandemic analysis is also provided. This review paper covers both medical and technological perspectives to facilitate the virologists, AI researchers and policymakers while in combating the COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - Context
People who have recently recovered from the threat of deteriorating coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have antibodies to the coronavirus circulating in their blood. Thus, the transfusion of these antibodies to deteriorating patients could theoretically help boost their immune system. Biologically, two challenges need to be surmounted to allow convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue the most severe COVID-19 patients. First, convalescent subjects must meet donor selection plasma criteria and comply with national health requirements and known standard routine procedures. Second, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems should be considered in the selection of the most suitable CP and the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19.
Objective
This paper presents a rescue framework for the transfusion of the best CP to the most critical patients with COVID-19 on the basis of biological requirements by using machine learning and novel MCDM methods.
Method
The proposed framework is illustrated on the basis of two distinct and consecutive phases (i.e. testing and development). In testing, ABO compatibility is assessed after classifying donors into the four blood types, namely, A, B, AB and O, to indicate the suitability and safety of plasma for administration in order to refine the CP tested list repository. The development phase includes patient and donor sides. In the patient side, prioritisation is performed using a contracted patient decision matrix constructed between ‘serological/protein biomarkers and the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fractional inspired oxygen criteria’ and ‘patient list based on novel MCDM method known as subjective and objective decision by opinion score method’. Then, the patients with the most urgent need are classified into the four blood types and matched with a tested CP list from the test phase in the donor side. Thereafter, the prioritisation of CP tested list is performed using the contracted CP decision matrix.
Result
An intelligence-integrated concept is proposed to identify the most appropriate CP for corresponding prioritised patients with COVID-19 to help doctors hasten treatments.
Discussion
The proposed framework implies the benefits of providing effective care and prevention of the extremely rapidly spreading COVID-19 from affecting patients and the medical sector.

AB  - To cope up with drastically increasing demand for radio resources lead to raise a challenge to the wireless community. The limited radio spectrum and fixed spectrum allocation strategy have become a bottleneck for various wireless communication. Cognitive Radio (CR) technology along with potential benefits of machine learning has attracted substantial research interest especially in the context of spectrum management. However, a variety of performance attributes as objectives draw attention during the technological preparations for spectrum management such as higher spectral efficiency, lower latency, higher network capacity, and better energy efficiency as these objectives are often conflicting with each other. Hence, this paper addresses the spectrum allocation problem concerning network capacity and spectrum efficiency as conflicting objectives and model the scenario as a multi-objective optimization problem in CR networks. An improved version of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) which combines the feature of evolutionary algorithm and machine learning called Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm based on Reinforcement Learning (NSGA-RL) is proposed which incorporates a self-tuning parameter approach to handle multiple conflicting objectives. The numerical findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through the Pareto optimal set and obtain optimal solution efficiently to satisfy various requirements of spectrum allocation in CR networks.

AB  - Present study has attempted to measure Water Richness (WR) and Wetland Habitat Suitability (WHS) in deltaic environment and assessed their spatial linkages. Water richness exhibits availability of water in wetland and its dynamicity, whereas wetland habitat suitability depicts physical habitat ambiance of a wetland toward vibrant ecosystem. Both the components are very essential and should be measured to explore ecosystem service and environmental heath of a region. For investigating water richness of the wetland six water availability indicating parameters have been chosen and for assessing wetland habitat suitability four additional parameters have been taken into consideration. Four widely used and recognised machine learning algorithms like Reduced Error Pruning (REP) tree, Random forest, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been employed here in order to develop suitable model at two phases. Results reveal that very high water rich zone is found over 200–215 km2 wetland area followed by high water rich zone over 125–140 km2 wetland area in both the phases. Wetland habitat suitability assessment shows only 100–150 km2 of the wetland having very high suitability and 110–120 km2 of wetland having high suitability. Field investigation and accuracy assessment support the validity and acceptability of the results. Spatial linkage between water richness and habitat suitability demonstrates that 30–40% very high water rich zone represents very high habitat suitability figuring out importance of both the models. Therefore, results recommend that only water richness of the wetlands of the wetlands is not enough to represent the habitat suitability in the densely populated riparian flood plain region.

AB  - Pedestrian crossings are sites in which vehicles and pedestrians can crash into each other, and are very important in terms of urban traffic. Drivers and pedestrians are more likely to violate traffic regulations, and thus adversely affect traffic safety and flow, in streets that have many such crossings. Careful planning of pedestrian crossing locations provides a solution to these problems. In this study, a corridor-based analysis of such sites is performed. Twenty-four criteria that are considered to affect pedestrian crossing locations and traffic flow aredetermined. Based on these criteria, the most suitable pedestrian crossing scenario is identified using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija I Komoromisno Resenje (VIKOR) from Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods are used to evaluate the pedestrian crossing locations, and PTV VISSIM is used to examine the impact of these sites on traffic. The proposed method is then applied to a case study of Erzurum, Turkey that involves determining the best pedestrian crossing scenario. The results show that the most suitable scenario is S.2. In terms of the evaluation criteria, this alternative scenario provides an improvement of up to 50 % over the current situation. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to reveal the effect of changing the criteria weights on the evaluation process.

Several cybersecurity vendors are offering a variety of CTI services and capabilities to their customers. The wide variety in the CTI service offerings by different providers makes it difficult for the security experts to decide which service provider is most suitable according to their security program requirements. Current approaches for ranking CTI service providers are based on a limited set of Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and do not consider the customer’s security program relevance and requirements. In this work, an extensive set of KPI to rank CTI service providers is defined. This paper proposes a framework, which is a first of its kind that assigns weights to KPI based on the customer’s requirements and ranks CTI service providers. This framework significantly helps the security program leaders in decision making for CTI service provider selection. It is designed to improve the quality of service offerings by promoting healthy competition among CTI service providers.

AB  - Sustainability has emerged as one of the most important issues in the international market. Ignorance of sustainability aspects has led many manufacturing organisations to face huge financial losses. It has been observed that developed nations have successfully achieved sustainability in their manufacturing sectors. However, the rate of sustainability adoption in developing nations is significantly poorer. The current business trend offers new technologies such as the Internet of Things, Big data analytics, Blockchain, Machine learning, etc. These technologies can be termed under the Industry 4.0 paradigm when considered within a manufacturing context. It is significant to notice that such new technologies directly or indirectly contribute to sustainability. So, it is necessary to explore the enablers that facilitate sustainability adoption. This study aims to develop a framework to improve sustainability adoption across manufacturing organisations of developing nations using Industry 4.0 technologies. Initially, the enablers that strongly influence sustainability adoption are identified through a literature review. Further, a large scale survey is conducted to finalise the Industry 4.0 technologies’ enablers to be included in the framework. Based on the empirical analysis, a framework is developed and tested across an Indian manufacturing case organisation. Finally, Robust Best Worst Method (RBWM) is utilised to identify the intensity of influence of each enabler included in the framework. The findings of the study reveal that managerial and economical, and environmental enablers possess a strong contribution toward sustainability adoption. The outcomes of the present study will be beneficial for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

AB  - Exploiting Content-Centric Networking (CCN) caching capabilities in which contents are cached on intermediate nodes can be beneficial in IoT as it can decrease the latency, reduce required transmission hops, limit traffic load on the content producer and improves availability. This article presents a new scheme for caching the contents in IoT environments. In the proposed method, devices are grouped into clusters where the cluster heads act as the cache controller. Additionally, we consider a global SDN/Cache controller (GSCC), which is responsible for orchestrating cache decisions in the whole IoT network. Such a centrally managed caching system increases the efficiency of resource usage in the IoT network. In the proposed scheme, the decision about caching the content is made in three steps: 1) determining the value of content and make decisions about caching it, 2) determining the candidate cluster, and 3) selecting candidate nodes for caching the content. In each step, several metrics are taken into account, and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approaches such as Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and TOPSIS are used to select the best option based on considered criteria. Simulation results show that our proposed caching method can achieve an average cache hit rate of 72% and decreases the average hop count of content retrievals by 42%. Moreover, our results confirm the superiority of our algorithm over some existing methods in terms of different evaluation metrics.

This framework integrates the key components of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) which include preference handling, Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) and a posteriori selection. To this end, three well-known MOEAs such as NSGA-II, SPEA-II and MOEA/D are thoroughly investigated to determine if there exists any significant difference in their search performance. The sensitivity of all these MOEAs to various qualitative and quantitative parameters, such as the choice of recombination mechanism, crossover and mutation probabilities, is also studied. These issues are critically analyzed considering seven discrete-time and a continuous-time benchmark nonlinear system as well as a practical case study of non-linear wave-force modeling. The results of this investigation demonstrate that MOEAs can be tailored to determine the correct structure of nonlinear systems. Further, it has been established through frequency domain analysis that it is possible to identify multiple valid discrete-time models for continuous-time systems. A rigorous statistical analysis of MOEAs via performance sweet spots in the parameter space convincingly demonstrates that these algorithms are robust over a wide range of control parameters.

AB  - Establishment of a maintenance service network has become increasingly urgent to ensure the safety and reliability of agricultural operation in busy farming seasons. This paper aims to design the maintenance service network in agriculture and focuses on the joint selection of service providers in network nodes. A novel intelligent decision-making approach is developed based on expert knowledge and machine learning techniques. First, a set of evaluation criteria for the group of service providers is defined from both qualitative and quantitative aspects. The adaptive fuzzy-neuro approach is proposed for selection of the group of service providers. Fuzzy rules designed by experts are applied for scheme classification and adaptive neural network is developed for the modification of memberships functions. Lastly, the proposed methodology is demonstrated by designing a real maintenance service network in Hunan, China. Experimental results in real application scenarios manifest that the proposed approach provides optimal solutions for decision making and providers’ selection in a maintenance service network.

AB  - The convergence of Social Mobility Analytics and Cloud (SMAC) technologies resulted in an unexpected upsurge of web services on the internet. The flexibility and rental approach of the cloud makes it an attractive option for the deployment of web services-based applications. Once a number of web services are available to gratify the similar functionalities, then the choice of the web service based on personalized quality of service (QoS) parameters plays an important role in deciding the selection of the web service. The role of time is rarely being discussed in deciding the QoS of web services. The delivery of QoS is not made as declared due to the correlated behavior of the non-functional performance of web services with the invocation time. This happens because service status usually changes over time. These limitations have affected the performance of neighborhood-based collaborative filtering. Hence, the design of the time aware web service recommendation system based on the personalized QoS parameters is very crucial and turns out to be a challenging research issue. In the current work, various neural network models like Levenberg Marquardt (LM), Bayesian-Regularization (BR) and Scaled-Conjugate-Gradient (SCG) are used for experimentation with the input time series to find the best fit model for the prediction of personalized QoS based web services recommendation. The Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient is used as an evaluation metric and their value for the prediction of Response time is found to be 0.84985 and for throughput (TP) is found to be 0.99082 with the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm. Thus, the experimental results show that the with the Levenberg Marquardt model of Time Series Forecasting for Web Services Recommendation Framework is performing better in case of Response time as well as throughput.

AB  - Fibre composites, and especially aligned discontinuous composites (ADCs), offer enormous versatility in composition, microstructure, and performance, but are difficult to optimise, due to their inherent variability and myriad permutations of microstructural design variables. This work combines an accurate yet efficient virtual testing framework (VTF) with a data-driven intelligent Bayesian optimisation routine, to maximise the mechanical performance of ADCs for a number of single- and multi-objective design cases. The use of a surrogate model helps to minimise the number of optimisation iterations, and provides a more accurate insight into the expected performance of materials which feature significant variability. Results from the single-objective optimisation study show that a wide range of structural properties can be achieved using ADCs, with a maximum stiffness of 505 GPa, maximum ultimate strain of 3.94%, or a maximum ultimate strength of 1.92 GPa all possible. A moderate trade-off in performance can be achieved when considering multi-objective optimisation design cases, such as an optimal ultimate strength & ultimate strain combination of 982 MPa and 3.27%, or an optimal combination of 720 MPa yield strength & 1.91% pseudo-ductile strain.

AB  - Geothermal energy is a type of renewable energy with high availability and independence from climatic and atmospheric conditions. It has been shown that geothermal energy is technically, economically and environmentally more suitable for hydrogen production than other renewable sources. Hydrogen has wide applications in many fields including cooling, oil, gas, petrochemical, nuclear, and energy industries. Afghanistan has significant potential in geothermal power generation and also several hydrogen-consuming industries that provide opportunities for geothermal-based hydrogen production. This study attempted to find suitable locations for the construction of geothermal power plant for hydrogen production in Afghanistan. Given the multitude of criteria involved in the choice of location, evaluations and comparisons were performed using multi-criteria decision-making methods. Nine criteria were used to evaluate 17 Afghanistan provinces in terms of suitability for geothermal-based hydrogen production. The SWARA (Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) method was used to weight the criteria and then the ARAS (Additive Ratio Assessment) method was used to rank the provinces. The results were validated. The results showed that Sari pul, Balkh and Herat are the most suitable Afghanistan provinces and Zabul, Ghor and Kandahar are the least suitable Afghanistan provinces for geothermal-based hydrogen production. The three methods produced almost identical rankings with only minor differences in the overall ranking of some provinces.

This is due to the diversity of operational and local parameters, as well as the multitude of stakeholders involved, who generally have conflicting interests. This sets up a challenging multi-criteria decision problem on the activities to be carried out during the decommissioning process. This paper aims to present an overview of decision-support tools applied to decommissioning, and covers many economic sectors, with a focus on the oil and gas sector and on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods. The paper delves deep into the aspects to be considered before reaching a decision, examining the experiences and methods found both in industrial reports and in academic papers.

AB  - Building data forecasting plays an increasingly important role in building energy savings. However, the one-fits-all model cannot satisfy all the requirements of multiple application scenarios and user preferences. Motivated by the need to bridge the research gap between different user preferences (application scenarios) and energy prediction model recommendation systems, this paper proposes a novel meta-learning strategy based on an artificial neural network recommendation system. This strategy is employed for real-time cooling loads, coefficients of performance prediction and optimal prediction model recommendations. The data set is composed of 40 cases from five factory buildings. After the predictions and recommendations are obtained for all cases, the two-stage user preferences are considered based on multi-objective decision-making algorithms. Then, a new model termed the “walking slide method”, is proposed to predict some special cases. This study shows that the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model and random forest model achieve the best prediction accuracy and the minimum computation cost separately for most cases, while the long short-term memory is the best model when considering the two criteria. The variances between the different cases lead to a lower cross-validation score (approximately 65%), but a higher success rate (over 99%) for the recommendation performance. In addition, in the more complex application scenarios, a lower prediction accuracy and recommendation success rate will be obtained. In most cases, the use of a prediction combined with a monitoring system is the best choice. Last, the reliability of the results is verified by application studies. This work provides a scientific basis for energy prediction applications based on user preferences.

AB  - The analysis and improvement of product quality for process industry is an increasing concern for academia and industry. As the outputs of a manufacturing system mainly depend on corresponding input conditions, so it is of high significance to develop an optimization scheme to actively and accurately determine operating parameters to obtain desired quality. However, the widely employed single-model modeling mode for whole production process neglects the natural characteristics within process manufacturing system such as multistage manufacturing and hysteresis. Additionally, the popular data-driven modeling techniques in current works, especially black-box machine learning models have been restricted to satisfying the requirements regarding excellent approximation capability and explicit mathematical expression simultaneously. To fill up above research gap, it is meaningful to develop a new data-driven optimization scheme in this work to effectively and accurately determine the optimum operating parameters considering the abovementioned characteristics and requirements. Firstly, two different connecting strategies are discussed to determine the more accurate and feasible quality propagation mode between adjacent stages. Then, two computational intelligence (CI) techniques, i.e., Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (MGGP) and Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm are exploited to construct correlation model with explicit mathematical expression and derive the optimal operating parameters, respectively. Afterwards, the fuzzy Multi-criteria Decision Making (FMCDM) method is further proposed to select the optimal solution from the obtained Pareto solutions sets. The application of the proposed scheme in a coal preparation process indicates that the proposed scheme is promising and competitive on prediction accuracy and optimization efficiency over baseline methods, and can significantly improve the final product quality comparing with initial parameters setting. Moreover, the feasible quality specification for intermediate product can also be obtained by our proposed scheme which is beneficial for early detection of quality abnormality and timely parameters adjustment.

In this study, Ponnaniyaru watershed of Cauvery basin was considered for this research. Geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) plays a vital role in preparing various thematic layers for targeting the groundwater potential zones (GWPZ). This study adopts the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Multi influence factor (MIF), multi-criteria decision-making approaches to determine the weights for the influencing factors. Weighted linear overlay analysis was carried out to determine the GWPZ. Further, the resultant GWPZ map has been reclassified into five different classes, namely Very good, Good, Moderate, Poor and Very poor. The results were validated with observed well-yield data, and the predictive precision for AHP and MIF was found to be 75%, and 71% respectively.

AB  - The lack of industrialization, inadequacy of the management, information inaccuracy, and inefficient supply chains are the significant issues in an agri-food supply chain. The proposed solutions to overcome these challenges should not only consider the way the food is produced but also take care of societal, environmental and economic concerns. There has been increasing use of emerging technologies in the agriculture supply chains. The internet of things, the blockchain, and big data technologies are potential enablers of sustainable agriculture supply chains. These technologies are driving the agricultural supply chain towards a digital supply chain environment that is data-driven. Realizing the significance of a data-driven sustainable agriculture supply chain we extracted and reviewed 84 academic journals from 2000 to 2017. The primary purpose of the review was to understand the level of analytics used (descriptive, predictive and prescriptive), sustainable agriculture supply chain objectives attained (social, environmental and economic), the supply chain processes from where the data is collected, and the supply chain resources deployed for the same. Based on the results of the review, we propose an application framework for the practitioners involved in the agri-food supply chain that identifies the supply chain visibility and supply chain resources as the main driving force for developing data analytics capability and achieving the sustainable performance. The framework will guide the practitioners to plan their investments to build a robust data-driven agri-food supply chain. Finally, we outline the future research directions and limitations of our study.

AB  - Replica selection in data grids aims to select the best replica location based on the quality-of-service parameters preferred by the user. This choice is important because of the limited number of available data resources in comparison with the large number of users. Typically, user requests are fulfilled in a first-in, first-out manner. This may satisfy the users at the beginning of the queue more than those at the end. Better results can be achieved by considering the requests of all users simultaneously, thereby leading to a higher level of overall satisfaction; however, this is a difficult task because it requires a vast order of magnitude to search through a huge set of users. Therefore, in this study, the proposed combination of hybrid of the genetic algorithm and user-preference algorithm is used to overcome this problem. The results overwhelmingly verify that the proposed hybrid approach outperformed previously known used methods significantly.

AB  - Fuzzy logic controllers are increasingly applied to control complex systems because they have several advantages. The objective of this work is to propose a new technique to optimize a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy logic controller with quality using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II by optimizing three objectives functions which are a cost function, the number of fuzzy inference rules, and the maximum instantaneous quadratic error. In this technique, the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making approach is used to choose one of the best controllers from the Pareto set of the last generation of the genetic algorithm. The proposed technique ensure: (i) that the output of the controlled system correctly follows the desired reference. (ii) the acceleration of the control process and (iii) avoid the existence of large overshoots; which are usually observed when applying commands to complex processes with variable behavior. At the end of the control process, a robustness test is performed to verify the efficiency of the proposed technique. It is shown here that the optimization of the third objective function, allows the improvement of the control quality. This new technique can be used to improve expert and intelligent systems based on fuzzy rules to control high complex systems with variable behavior which they have disturbing overshoots during their control. This technique; allows to accelerate the calculation of the control law of expert systems based on fuzzy rules; while ensuring that the quality of the control and the output signal are good.

This is especially true for complex models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which are the best-suited algorithms for modeling very complex and nonlinear relationships. But this need to understand has become a must since privacy regulations are hardening the industrial use of these models. There are different techniques to address the interpretability issues that Machine Learning models arises. This paper is focused on opening the so-called Deep Neural architectures black-box. This research extends the technique called Layer-wise Relevant Propagation (LRP) enhancing its properties to compute the most critical paths in different deep neural architectures using multicriteria analysis. We call this technique Ranked-LRP and it was tested on four different datasets and tasks, including classification and regression. The results show the worth of our proposal.

AB  - Numerous studies have focused on making telemedicine smart through the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. These works span a wide range of research areas to enhance telemedicine architecture such as network communications, artificial intelligence methods and techniques, IoT wearable sensors and hardware devices, smartphones and cloud computing. Accordingly, several telemedicine applications covering various human diseases have presented their works from a specific perspective and resulted in confusion regarding the IoT characteristics. Although such applications are useful and necessary for improving telemedicine contexts related to monitoring, detection and diagnostics, deriving an overall picture of how IoT characteristics are currently integrated with the telemedicine architecture is difficult. Accordingly, this study complements the academic literature with a systematic review covering all main aspects of advances in IoT-based telemedicine architecture. This study also provides a state-of-the-art telemedicine classification taxonomy under IoT and reviews works in different fields in relation to that classification. To this end, this study checked the ScienceDirect, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, and Web of Science databases. A total of 2121 papers were collected from 2014 to July 2020. The retrieved articles were filtered according to the defined inclusion criteria. A final set of 141 articles were selected and classified into two categories, each followed by subcategories and sections. The first category includes an IoT-based telemedicine network that accounts for 24.11% (n = 34/141). The second category includes IoT-based telemedicine healthcare services and applications that account for 75.89% (n = 107/141). This multi-field systematic review has exposed new research opportunities, motivations, recommendations and challenges that need attention for the synergistic integration of interdisciplinary works. This extensive study also lists a set of open issues and provides innovative key solutions along with a systematic review. The classification of diseases under IoT-based telemedicine is divided into 14 groups. Furthermore, the crossover in our taxonomy is demonstrated. The lifecycle of the context of IoT-based telemedicine healthcare applications is mapped for the first time, including the procedure sequencing and definition for each context. We believe that this study is a useful guide for researchers and practitioners in providing direction and valuable information for future research. This study can also address the ambiguity in the trends in IoT-based telemedicine.

AB  - Clustering is an important concept in vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) where several vehicles join to form a group based on common features. Mobility-based clustering strategies are the most common in VANET clustering; however, machine learning and fuzzy logic algorithms are also the basis of many VANET clustering algorithms. Some VANET clustering algorithms integrate machine learning and fuzzy logic algorithms to make the cluster more stable and efficient. Network mobility (NEMO) and multi-hop-based strategies are also used for VANET clustering. Mobility and some other clustering strategies are presented in the existing literature reviews; however, extensive study of intelligence-based, mobility-based, and multi-hop-based strategies still missing in the VANET clustering reviews. In this paper, we presented a classification of intelligence-based clustering algorithms, mobility-based algorithms, and multi-hop-based algorithms with an analysis on the mobility metrics, evaluation criteria, challenges, and future directions of machine learning, fuzzy logic, mobility, NEMO, and multi-hop clustering algorithms.

AB  - Food process modeling has matured with the development of multiscale, multiphase and multi-physics approaches. More comprehensive numerical tools and software platforms for improving insights and optimizing designs and processes have emerged. In the context of industrial digitalization and the advent of the Internet of Things, the concept of the digital twin has recently emerged as a means for more versatile process operational management. The digital twin is defined as a virtual replica of the real process operation, which is connected to the real world by sensor data and advanced big data analytical tools. While all elements are available for implementing digital twins, with the different types of models playing a central role, it will require a multidisciplinary approach for successful implementation and operation. The first agrofood applications still need to be demonstrated. This paper mainly focusses on the role more physics-based models can play, in addition to data-driven and hybrid models.

AB  - The role of reusability cannot be neglected in the software component selection since it determines the worth of a component for its potential (re)use. The reusability is a qualitative feature and it is arduous to measure it directly. Typically, it is assessed subjectively without paying much heed to the involvement of befitting stakeholders and the use of a quantitative approach. We aim to quantify the reusability of a software component based on its quality through multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) solution to rank alternatives. To do this, the quality preferences of stakeholders about the reuse of components are determined. The reusability is quantified using a hybrid fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and quality metrics approach. In this approach, the weights of both FAHP and quality metrics are integrated to get the final ranking. FAHP-Metrics approach is applied to payment gateway (software) components, and the ranking of given components is obtained based on their reusability value. Finally, the comparative analysis of our results with respect to other recent studies reveals that the Spearman rank correlation result is highly significant and acceptable, and the obtained weights have a good association with other studies.

AB  - Process planning for a computer numerical control (CNC) machining is a multi-objective decision-making activity. A process planner defines machining set-up along with operation-sequencing at macro-level and decides toolpath strategies with its cutting parameters at micro-level. This paper proposes a data driven model that enables consideration of energy consumption also as a decision-making criterion during process planning for five-axis machining. A two-stage predictive energy model with an intermediate stage of exact feed prediction is proposed for machining on a five-axis machine. A process planner can use this model to choose optimal machining conditions that minimizes energy consumption during five-axis machining.

AB  - Multi-criteria-based group decision-making methods are important in the area of data science. Many of such works are focused on multi criteria with crisp inputs. However, in practice approximate reasoning methodology is used to address multi criteria. In general decision-making problems are categorized as problems under uncertain environment where uncertainty is due to fuzziness of criteria for the set of substitutes. In order to select the best among the available feasible alternatives, it is mandatory to execute multi-criteria decision-making problem using soft computing approach. In this study, we have developed performance index algorithm to implement the methodology of fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methodologies. A fuzzy likeness between evaluation alternatives and extreme solutions of a decision matrix is the backbone of performance index algorithm. The computation steps of proposed fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making method are quite simple, efficient & it is also one of the goals of this paper to reduce computational loads for a multi-criteria decision-making problem under fuzzy environment. Proposed method is compared with a standard method for order preference through comparison to ideal outcomes.

AB  - This work deals with the optimization of the internal layout oil tankers under uncertainties, aiming at the robustness of ship safety and the improvement of economical functionality in the domain of environmental pollution prevention. The design variables are the positions of watertight members in the internal layout and the original merit functions are the maximization of cargo capacity and minimization of the longitudinal bending moment in sagging and hogging conditions. The constraints are the regulatory limits and the essential requirement of a proper design. The uncertainties of the prediction of bending moment and accidental consequences are incorporated into the objectives and constraints of the defined problem by a robust–based approach. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is applied to the converted problem under uncertainty to approach the Pareto solutions. Finally, the selection of final design among the Pareto frontier is defined as a post-optimization process by using a method of multi-criteria decision-making. The discussion of the final design is provided by a comparative study.

AB  - This study presents a systematic review of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques used in the detection and classification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) medical images in terms of evaluation and benchmarking. Five reliable databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus were used to obtain relevant studies of the given topic. Several filtering and scanning stages were performed according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria to screen the 36 studies obtained; however, only 11 studies met the criteria. Taxonomy was performed, and the 11 studies were classified on the basis of two categories, namely, review and research studies. Then, a deep analysis and critical review were performed to highlight the challenges and critical gaps outlined in the academic literature of the given subject. Results showed that no relevant study evaluated and benchmarked AI techniques utilised in classification tasks (i.e. binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical classifications) of COVID-19 medical images. In case evaluation and benchmarking will be conducted, three future challenges will be encountered, namely, multiple evaluation criteria within each classification task, trade-off amongst criteria and importance of these criteria. According to the discussed future challenges, the process of evaluation and benchmarking AI techniques used in the classification of COVID-19 medical images considered multi-complex attribute problems. Thus, adopting multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is an essential and effective approach to tackle the problem complexity. Moreover, this study proposes a detailed methodology for the evaluation and benchmarking of AI techniques used in all classification tasks of COVID-19 medical images as future directions; such methodology is presented on the basis of three sequential phases. Firstly, the identification procedure for the construction of four decision matrices, namely, binary, multi-class, multi-labelled and hierarchical, is presented on the basis of the intersection of evaluation criteria of each classification task and AI classification techniques. Secondly, the development of the MCDA approach for benchmarking AI classification techniques is provided on the basis of the integrated analytic hierarchy process and VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje methods. Lastly, objective and subjective validation procedures are described to validate the proposed benchmarking solutions.

AB  - The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in geohazard modelling has been rapidly growing in recent years, a trend that is observed in several research and application areas thanks to recent advances in AI. As a result, the increasing dependence on data driven studies has made its practical applications towards geohazards (landslides, debris flows, earthquakes, droughts, floods, glacier studies) an interesting prospect. These aforementioned geohazards were responsible for roughly 80% of the economic loss in the past two decades caused by all natural hazards. The present study analyses the various domains of geohazards which have benefited from classical machine learning approaches and highlights the future course of direction in this field. The emergence of deep learning has fulfilled several gaps in: i) classification; ii) seasonal forecasting as well as forecasting at longer lead times; iii) temporal based change detection. Apart from the usual challenges of dataset availability, climate change and anthropogenic activities, this review paper emphasizes that the future studies should focus on consecutive events along with integration of physical models. The recent catastrophe in Japan and Australia makes a compelling argument to focus towards consecutive events. The availability of higher temporal resolution and multi-hazard dataset will prove to be essential, but the key would be to integrate it with physical models which would improve our understanding of the mechanism involved both in single and consecutive hazard scenario. Geohazards would eventually be a data problem, like geosciences, and therefore it is essential to develop models that would be capable of handling large voluminous data. The future works should also revolve towards interpretable models with the hope of providing a reasonable explanation of the results, thereby achieving the ultimate goal of Explainable AI.

AB  - Smart grid is the new trend for clean, sustainable, efficient and reliable energy generation, delivery and use. To ensure stable and secure operation is essential for the smart grid, which needs effective stability analysis and control. As the smart grid has evolved through a growing scale of interconnection, increasing integration of renewable energy, widespread operation of direct current power transmission systems, and liberalization of electricity markets, the stability characteristics of it are much more complex than the past. Due to these changes, conventional stability analysis and control approaches have a series of drawbacks in terms of speed, effectiveness and economy. On the contrary, the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provide powerful and promising tools for stability analysis and control in smart grids and have attracted growing attention. This paper aims to give a comprehensive and clear picture of recent advances in this research area. First, we present a general overview of AI, including its definitions, history and state-of-the-art methodologies. And then, this paper gives a comprehensive review of its applications to security assessment, stability assessment, fault diagnosis, and stability control in smart grids. These applications have achieved impressive results. Nevertheless, we also identify some major challenges these applications face in practice: high requirements on data, imbalanced learning, interpretability of AI, difficulties in transfer learning, the robustness of AI to communication quality, and the robustness against attack or adversarial examples. Furthermore, we provide suggestions for potential important future investigation directions to overcome these challenges and bridge the gap between research and practice.

AB  - Trigeneration systems with Thermal storage (CCHP-TS) allow a distributed generation of energy. They also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by producing electricity, heating, and cooling from the same fuel. Current research targets their operational performance and feasibility. Nevertheless, expressing these concepts into standard criteria could foster their adoption by investors and policy-makers. This paper finds some rules of thumb for the technical and economic feasibility of CCHP-TS systems. The analysis comprises 600 scenarios, assessing the impact of different levels of spark spread (SS) rate and load size of Electricity, Heating, and Cooling. The methodology first optimizes the energy system with DER-CAM and after analyzes the output data through the clustering method k-means and the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making method ELECTRE 1S. Moreover, the paper proposes the dominance load rates to quantify the relative size of electricity, heating and cooling loads. The results show that for high SS rates, the percentage of savings improves with the dominance of electric loads. While for small SS rates, the improvement comes from the equilibrium of loads. Furthermore, for any SS, a high dominance of electricity promotes the use of Absorption and Cooling Storage, reducing the Heat Scrap.

AB  - This study solves the location problem for establishing a logistics hub that serves as a consolidation center to distribute urban freight in the North Western Region of Iran. A novel multi-method approach is developed to implement a two-stage research framework. GIS-embedded multi-criteria decision tools are applied to identify potential regions; a K-means based heuristic approach is developed to select five potential sites; and PROMETHEE, multi-criteria decision-making tool, is implemented to ascertain the best possible site for establishing logistics hub. “Višekriterijumska Optimizacija i kompromisno Rešenje” (VIKOR) method is applied on multiple region-specific criteria to identify potential regions suitable for the logistics hub. A novel clustering Mixed Integer Quadratic constrained Programming (MIQCP) is then applied for clustering the centriods representing the most suitable sites.A K-means heuristic approach is also implemented as an alternative clustering solution approach to improve computational time for data processing. Several criteria such as cost, profit, health effects, political matters and regulations are then used to identify the best site using PROMETHEE method. The outputs of this study may inform evidence based decision-making help to solve highly complex, multi-scaled, and multi-criteria location problems. Municipal authorities, in conjunction with industry, can apply this framework to identify the best compromised site for establishing a regional logistics hub, which in turn help reduce costs, improve logistic efficiency and enhance regional performance.

AB  - Manufacturing industries need to bring the balance among economical, environmental, and social aspects for sustaining the market existence. Sustainable Manufacturing is one of the recent beneficial areas which can bring the balance among economical, environmental, and social aspects. A comprehensive review study needs to be carried out for a better understanding of sustainable manufacturing. The prime objective of the present study is to explore different insights from the past literature which can assist the better adoption of sustainable manufacturing. To explore various insights and gaps in sustainable manufacturing, 541 articles are selected from SCOPUS database (January 2001 to March 2019). The selected articles are categorized based on year, publishers, journals, the status of the country, universities, citations, manufacturing industries, research design, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques, data analysis techniques, sustainable dimensions, and focused areas. The categorization of selected articles assists in exploring various gaps such as 70.43% of the studies in the literature are focused on qualitative aspects. Most of the studies in the literature are dominated by developed countries as 63.40% of the studies are carried out in developed countries. Looking at the significant contribution in the economical development of any country, the sustainable manufacturing adoption in food (2.96%), steel (2.77%) and chemical (2.77%) industries is recorded to be limited. More sustainable solutions must be identified which can reduce negative environmental impacts of the manufacturing processes. The selection of articles for the present study is limited to SCOPUS database which is a limitation of the present study.

AB  - One of the key challenges to improving the quality of service (QoS) in integrated heterogeneous mobile Internet protocol networks is the design of an intelligent decision engine for accessing various services anywhere and at any time. The multi-criteria decision making algorithm plays a significant role in ensuring universal and seamless connection. In this study, a multi-criteria vertical handoff decision algorithm plus dwell time is developed to achieve a satisfactory quality of service using the best access network selection in an integrated wireless local area network (WLAN), a worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), and a universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS). Handoffs are divided into two schemes: the UMTS originating handoff (downward) and the WLAN/WiMAX originating handoff (upward/intrasystem). The initial criteria for real-time and non-real-time services are presented. The metrics that are required to trigger a handoff are the predictive received signal strength (PRSS) of neighbor networks and the received signal strength obtained from the current network. The back propagation neural network is learned for the prediction. The dwell time is used as a counter to avoid the unnecessary handoffs that may occur in the overlapping areas. The quantitative network selection is the largest merit value and is based on the available bandwidth, cost, user preference, and the criteria to eliminate inappropriate candidate networks. The importance of using the PRSS, dwell time, and merit function is evaluated. To illustrate the QoS satisfaction, the multi-criteria vertical handoff decision algorithm outperforms the single-criteria using the hysteresis and Mamdani fuzzy method.

AB  - The term “Agri-Food 4.0” is an analogy to the term "Industry 4.0", coming from the concept “agriculture 4.0”. Since the origins of the industrial revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0 concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies, especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements. In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones, support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather, geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture 4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand the future paths of the Agri-Food domain.

AB  - The urban land use policy must pursue sustainable development goals. These objectives are not only economic but also social, cultural, and environmental. Therefore, the definition of investment programs for the city must take place by selecting the projects on the basis of multiple evaluation criteria. The aim of the work is to define a multi-criteria evaluation model capable of selecting the combination of the best combination of the projects that must make up an integrated urban regeneration program. The novelty of the research consists in combining the algorithms of the Analytical Network Process (ANP) with those of the Zero-One Goal Programming (ZOGP), where the ANP makes it possible to clarify the interdependence relations between the criteria, as well as between criteria and projects, while the ZOGP allows considering requirements and constraints of the reference system. The effectiveness of the analysis tool is verified in a case study. The results of the research show that the model is able to direct the decision-maker towards urban regeneration programs that, effectively, reach the maximization of the final benefits, both in financial and socio-environmental terms. The algorithms also reveal considerable flexibility of the instrument, so much that it can be easily applied also for the characterization of urban programs aimed at different territorial contexts. The effects that the application of the model may have on land use and on the processes of allocating public resources highlight the important implications of Economic Policy.

AB  - The publication indicator of the Finnish research funding system is based on a manual ranking of scholarly publication channels. These ranks, which represent the evaluated quality of the channels, are continuously kept up to date and thoroughly reevaluated every four years by groups of nominated scholars belonging to different disciplinary panels. This expert-based decision-making process is informed by available citation-based metrics and other relevant metadata characterizing the publication channels. The purpose of this paper is to introduce various approaches that can explain the basis and evolution of the quality of publication channels, i.e., ranks. This is important for the academic community, whose research work is being governed using the system. Data-based models that, with sufficient accuracy, explain the level of or changes in ranks provide assistance to the panels in their multi-objective decision making, thus suggesting and supporting the need to use more cost-effective, automated ranking mechanisms. The analysis relies on novel advances in machine learning systems for classification and predictive analysis, with special emphasis on local and global feature importance techniques.

AB  - Task of selecting the most suitable industrial steam boiler for a given process industry is a critical decision and becoming increasingly complex. That is why; the present research focuses on the use of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and TOPSIS in the selection of boiler for a soda ash industry. First the problem is prearranged in the typical AHP hierarchy, and then TOPSIS technique is employed. Soda ash industry experts are consulted to prioritize the parameters influencing in the selection of boilers. Boiler alternatives available in the market are evaluated for these parameters. TOPSIS method has been used on the bases of AHP pairwise comparison weights. The results indicates that experts looks more concerned about factors like steam capacity, working temperature and designed working pressure of boilers as compared to its cost. Final results also indicate that factors like weight and area of heating surfaces of boiler are very low on the priority list of industry experts. Moreover, it is concluded that the first, second and the fifth alternative ranks are the same in both methods. The way in which AHP and TOPSIS have been utilized will significantly help industrial managers involving in the selection process of a steam boiler.

To this end, a decision framework is proposed based on a multi-criteria decision structure that incorporates AHP into VIKOR under Intuitionistic Fuzzy Theory. This integration presents different solutions and rankings based on different decision-making strategies and also captures uncertainty in the evaluation process. While Intuitionistic Fuzzy AHP calculates the importance weights of the proposed criteria indicated as scalability, privacy, interoperability, audit, latency, visibility, trust, and security, Fuzzy VIKOR ranks the logistics operations demonstrated as materials handling, warehousing, order processing, transportation, packaging, fleet management, labeling, vehicle routing and product returns management. The proposed decision framework was applied in a large-scale logistics company located in Turkey. The findings of this study suggest that while the most important criteria are security, visibility and audit, the most feasible logistics operations proved to be transportation, materials handling, warehousing, order processing and fleet management in a possible blockchain implementation. The decision framework in this study may enable decision makers to evaluate the feasibility of blockchain in logistics operations, which is one of the main research gaps in the current blockchain research. Furthermore, this is the first study that integrates AHP and VIKOR methods under Intuitionistic Fuzzy Theory in the context of blockchain.

AB  - As a major priority to get better resource utilization and to ensure a high quality of life, research on smart disaster response systems (smart DRS) that based on information and communication technology (ICT) has been widespread. It’s imperative for smart cities to have smart disaster response systems so they can easily manage natural disasters efficiently such as tsunamis, earthquakes, and hurricanes. Lately, the Internet of Things (IoT) provided several solutions to confront the disaster concerns such as early cautions, remote controlling, data analysis and knowledge building. To evaluate the performance of the smart disaster response systems, there are a group of criteria that need to be measured. This study proposed an integrated framework to evaluate the performance of smart disaster response systems under uncertainty. Due to ensure a more accurate evaluation process, the proposed framework is based on plithogenic set theory that handles ambiguity and uncertainty in evaluation by considering the contradiction degree between the evaluation criteria. The problem of performance evaluation of the smart disaster response systems is formulated as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. The proposed framework is constructed using three common MCDM methods which is AHP, TOSIS, and VIKOR. Five smart disaster response systems will be evaluated in order to improve the reliability of the proposed framework.

AB  - The provision of clean and safe drinking water is a crucial task for water supply companies from all over the world. To this end, automatic anomaly detection plays a critical role in drinking water quality monitoring. Recent anomaly detection studies use techniques that focus on a single global objective. Yet, companies need solutions that better balance the trade-off between false positives (FPs), which lead to financial losses to water companies, and false negatives (FNs), which severely impact public health and damage the environment. This work proposes a novel dynamic multi-criteria ensemble selection mechanism to cope with both problems simultaneously: the non-dominated local class-specific accuracy (NLCA). Moreover, experiments rely on recent time series related classification metrics to assess the predictive performance. Results on data from a real-world water distribution system show that NLCA outperforms other ensemble learning and dynamic ensemble selection techniques by more than 15% in terms of time series related F1 scores. As a conclusion, NLCA enables the development of stronger anomaly detection systems for drinking water quality monitoring. The proposed technique also offers a new perspective on dynamic ensemble selection, which can be applied to different classification tasks to balance conflicting criteria.

AB  - Green supply chain management increasingly has emerged as an essential approach for many business enterprises and organizations to become environmentally sustainable. Suppliers play an important role in creating a sustainable supply chain. This study aims at selecting suppliers of Khouzestan Steel Company (KSC) based on their green innovation ability. In this research, the Company's alternative suppliers are identified and the most effective criteria for supplier selection based on the supplier's green innovation abilities is determined. The Best-Worst Method is used to rank the various criteria of green supplier selection in the multi-criteria decision-making problem. Then, the Fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is employed to rank the various suppliers based on weighted criteria for selecting the most effective suppliers among set of alternative suppliers. This study contributes to finding the key factors of selecting green suppliers for KSC. Analyzing the KSC supplier selection's key factors indicate that the green innovations criteria should be given more attention by KSC in the green supplier selection. The outcome of this research is helpful to rank the suppliers consequently based on their green innovation abilities. The organizations can replicate the proposed supplier selection framework for other suppliers such as spare parts, consumable materials and technical, design, and development services suppliers. Sensitivity analysis is also performed in order to check the robustness of the framework and eliminate the effect of biasness. Limitations of the study along with future research directions are also presented.

AB  - The world is rapidly urbanized in the recent decades and urban areas are dealing with enormous changes and demands in utilizing the land units. To prevent incongruous land development, a seamless land use control planning tool, impowered by a decision support system is an imperative part of development management. This study focuses on evaluating the suitability of existing land uses through a spatial decision support system. Although the problem involves various criteria as well as expert judgments, we dealt with a multi-criteria group decision making problem. The proposed methodology consists of two main sections: density-based induced ordered weighted averaging (D-IOWA) operator as a group decision making section to combine expert opinions on the problem, and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy resonance system (ANFIS) to define the compatibility of the land uses in their surrounding environment. Expert opinions were aggregated by the D-IOWA operator and the ANFIS model was trained and then applied to the rest of the data to generate the compatibility map of the residential areas. An accuracy of 81%, and a root mean square error of 0.44 were observed. Maximum 15% variation in the outputs was observed in the sensitivity analysis. In addition to the performance measurements of the model, some other models were implemented and compared with the ANFIS model. The comparisons concluded that most of the models provided acceptable accuracies while the ANFIS model acquired the best results and confirmed to be used in similar circumstances. This study confirmed that a multi-criteria decision-making system supported by an accurate classification system can provide a basis for a detailed and accurate distribution of land use across the land unit.

AB  - The ease of programmability in Software-Defined Networking has greatly facilitated SDN application development and deployment. Applications run simultaneously in the controller and generate policies to serve the network together. However, multiple applications may cause unintentionally harmful interferences even if each SDN application is properly programmed. Unfortunately, the existing SDN verification and test work have no consideration of application interferences. To solve this problem, we develop the mathematical models for applications and policies and elaborate the relationships of policies based on computational geometry. The application interference is formally defined according to policy conflict. To this end, we propose an efficient SDN Application Interference Detection and Elimination (SAIDE) scheme. Firstly, on the basis of designed policy refactor, we encode the matching fields of policies as bit vectors and design bit vectors AND operation to analyze the policy relationships. Then, we combine the action and refactor fields of policies to detect the application interferences (direct and indirect interferences). Finally, with multi-criteria decision making, we assign priorities to conflicting policies to eliminate the corresponding application interferences. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of SAIDE through a proof-of-concept prototype. Simulation results show that the SAIDE can effectively detect the application interferences with 98% accuracy at least and has reduced the detection time by 23.9% compared to the state-of-the-art work.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations generated dataset for training and testing by RVFL network, reducing processing time and assuring PFHE accuracy when applied in many-objective optimization based on Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III). Next, the NSGA-III was designed to achieve the maximum effectiveness, minimum volume, and pressure drop at the hot and cold sides in PFHE design. For experimental validation the Shear Stress Transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model was used to simulate the flow and heat transfer in PFHE showing 4.36% and 3.27% of error, respectively, to pressure drop and convective heat transfer coefficient measurements. The optimized results by NSGA-III indicated that the volume and effectiveness values are in agreement with the literature, decreasing approximately 55.4% and 72.3% of pressure drop at the hot and cold sides, respectively, which showed that the convective heat transfer was enhanced and the flow resistance was also significantly reduced.

AB  - Ship navigation safety is a growing concern in maritime transportation and shipping industry. Rescue ship patrol is an important operation for improving navigation safety in the marine environment. This paper proposes a patrol path support framework, which incorporates multiple criteria decision making, geographical information system (GIS), and linear programming, to determine optimal paths for rescue ships on routine patrols. The proposed framework comprises three steps. First, a navigation risk index is created to estimate the rescue demand by using GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis. Second, the patrol area of a rescue ship is identified based on a temporal accessibility model. Third, the optimal patrol path is determined by solving a linear programming problem. The northeastern South China Sea was taken as the area for a case study to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed framework, and the optimum patrol path was identified successfully. The findings of this study may help the concerned authorities to develop maritime patrol path planning.

AB  - This paper addresses the challenge of providing trustworthy recommendations on newly deployed cloud services/resources for which little or no evidence about their trustworthiness is available. We also provide a two-level dishonesty discouragement mechanism to fight against unfair recommendations at both the collection and aggregation levels. Our solution consists of a (1) mechanism to allow users to self-assess the accuracy of their recommendations and autonomously decide on whether to participate in the recommendation process or not, (2) machine learning technique that generates reliable endorsements on newcomer items through extracting hidden similarities among the specifications of new and existing ones, (3) dishonesty-aware aggregation technique for endorsements coming from multiple advisors, (4) credibility update mechanism that captures the dynamism in the endorsers’ credibility, and (5) incentive mechanism to motivate advisors to participate in the endorsement process. Experiments conducted on the CloudHarmony and Epinions datasets show that our solution improves the accuracy of classifying newly deployed cloud services and yields better performance in protecting the recommendation process against Sybil attacks, in comparison with four existing recommendation approaches.

AB  - The current study presents a novel combination of artificial neural network cross-validation (fourfold ANN-CV) with a hybrid analytic hierarchy process-Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (AHP-TOPSIS) method to improve the earthquake risk assessment (ERA) and applied it to Aceh, Indonesia, to test the model. Recent studies have suggested that neural networks improve probability mapping in a city scale. The network architecture design with probability index remains unexplored in earthquake-based probability studies. This study explored and specified the major indicators needed to improve the predictive accuracy in probability mapping. First, probability mapping was conducted and used for hazard assessment in the next step. Second, a vulnerability map was created based on social and structural factors. Finally, hazard and vulnerability indices were multiplied to produce the ERA, and the population and areas under risk were calculated. Results show that the proposed model achieves 85.4% accuracy, and its consistency ratio is 0.06. Risk varies from very high to high in the city center, approximately covering an area of 23% (14.82 km2) and a total population of 54,695. The model's performance changes on the basis of the input parameters, indicating the selection and importance of input layers on network architecture selection. The proposed model is found to generalize better results than traditional and some existing probabilistic models. The proposed model is simple and transferable to other regions by localizing the input parameters that contribute to earthquake risk mitigation and prevention planning.

AB  - Rapid developments in communication and information technologies in the world force local administrators to be more effective. For a local administrator to be elected again, satisfaction of citizens with the duties that need to be performed and the services provided is significant. In this study, citizen satisfaction with municipality services was measured using a questionnaire on a household level. It was aimed to develop a new approach in evaluation of municipal service quality. The data that were obtained were analyzed with fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making techniques. For determination of criterion weights, FDEMATEL was utilized, and for household-based ranking, the FTOPSIS technique was implemented. A raster map was created in the ArcGIS geostatistics module by applying IDW interpolation on the resulting values. The map that was produced visually revealed the satisfaction of citizens regarding the quality of municipality services based on location. When the map was analyzed, it was seen that the satisfaction levels in the study areas of two neighborhoods were high, while the levels in the study area of one neighborhood was low.

AB  - Industry 4.0 has brought forth many advantages and challenges for the industry players. Many organizations are strategizing to take advantage of this industrial paradigm shift, thus improving the sustainability of the enterprise. However, there are many factors such as talent development, machinery advancement and infrastructure development which involve huge investment that need to be considered. This paper presents an enhanced adaptive model for the implementation of the lean and green (L&G) strategy in processing sectors to solve dynamic industry problems associated with Industry 4.0. A feature of this enhanced adaptive model is that it combines experts’ experience and operational data as input in dealing with real industry application. A lean and green index is coupled in the model to serve as a benchmark and process improvement tracking indicator. This allows the industrialists to set a lean and green index (LGI) target for effective process improvement. From this integrated model, an ensemble of backpropagation optimizers is then used to identify the best-optimized strategy. This ensemble optimizer is formulated to perform operation improvement and update the targeted LGI automatically when a higher index is achieved for continuous improvement. A case study on a combined heat and power plant is performed and reflects an improvement of 18.25% on the LGI. This work serves as a practical transition strategy for the industrialist desiring to improve the sustainability of the facility with Industry 4.0 elements at minimum investment cost.

AB  - [Context and Motivation] Many requirements prioritization approaches have been proposed, however not all of them have been investigated empirically in real-life settings. As a result, our knowledge of their applicability and actual use is incomplete. [Question/problem] A 2007 systematic review on requirements prioritization mapped out the landscape of proposed prioritization approaches and their prioritization criteria. To understand how this sub-field of requirements engineering has developed since 2007 and what evidence has been accumulated through empirical evaluations, we carried out a literature review that takes as input publications published between 2007 and 2019. [Principle ideas/results] We evaluated 102 papers that proposed and/or evaluated requirements prioritization methods. Our results show that the newly proposed requirements prioritization methods tend to use as basis fuzzy logic and machine learning algorithms. We also concluded that the Analytical Hierarchy Process is the most accurate and extensively used requirement prioritization method in industry. However, scalability is still its major limitation when requirements are large in number. We have found that machine learning has shown potential to deal with this limitation. Last, we found that experiments were the most used research method to evaluate the various aspects of the proposed prioritization approaches. [Contribution] This paper identified and evaluated requirements prioritization techniques proposed between 2007 and 2019, and derived some trends. Limitations of the proposals and implications for research and practice are identified as well.

AB  - The car sharing is an effective supplement to public transportation systems. However, how to select an appropriate site for building a car sharing station is a big challenge. Therefore, in this paper, a novel picture fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model is proposed to solve the site selection problem for car sharing stations. To this end, the definition of picture fuzzy sets is adopted to accurately portray the voting information. Then, a concept of knowledge measure is defined for PFNs and an objective method based on knowledge measure is proposed to derive the weight information of criteria. To rank the candidate sites for car sharing stations, an extended MULTIMOORA method based on novel score function and Borda rule is devised. The proposed MCDM model is applied to solve the site selection for car sharing stations in Bejing. Finally, comparative analyses are given to verify the superiority of the proposed MCDM model.

AB  - The increasing global importance of climate change has been clearly recognised in the last few years. The building industry contributed to a large proportion of the global energy use and carbon emissions across material production, construction, operation and end-of-life. Utilizing computer simulation and optimisation to minimize the building life cycle environmental impacts has gained increasing attentions recently. There were researches on different kinds of computational optimisation in various contexts, but a critical review to identify and compare the optimisation approaches is still lacking and needed to demonstrate their strengths/weaknesses and to highlight the future research challenges. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to critically review the computer simulation and optimisation studies for minimizing the life cycle energy consumption and carbon emissions in buildings, with the aim of identifying the current practices and future research need in this field. The common research streams and methods (e.g., innovative structural systems and materials, energy retrofitting measures) were compared, with an in-depth analysis on the importance and benefits that come with their usages. Life cycle design optimisation with the consideration of production, operation and end-of-life of building systems has a growing importance for the sustainable development of the future towards resource-based circular economy. Moreover, emerging digital technologies (such as machine learning, data-driven design, and parametric 3D modelling) enable greater automation in early design exploration and advance decision marking in design optimisation. As human factors (e.g., energy-related occupant behaviours) become important metrics in the built environment, multi-disciplinary design should be adopted to generate social-technical solutions that encompass both environmental sustainability and human wellbeing.

AB  - Crisis management systems should be assessed and updated in petrochemical industries due to hazards, such as fire and explosion. Successful crisis management systems can protect both personnel and property in the petrochemical industries. The present study aimed to assess crisis management systems of five petrochemical plants in terms of three aspects, including organizational aspects, human aspects, and technical aspects. A questionnaire was designed, encompassing 34 items to cover all three aspects at both management and staff levels. A multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach, including the entropy method and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), was used to analyze the collected data. The outcomes of the entropy method indicated that organizational and human aspects had the greatest influence on crisis management systems of the plants with 58% and 49% importance at management and staff levels, respectively. The crisis management systems of the investigated plants were ranked and analyzed using the TOPSIS approach. The findings of this study could assist managers and other decision-makers to address the issues of crisis management systems in petrochemical industries.

AB  - In this study Response Surface Methodology (RSM), artificial neural network (ANN) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) were used for modeling and multi objective optimization of Al 6351/ Egg Shell Reinforced Composite. The properties of the composite optimized were toughness and hardness whose values vary in response to changes in production process variables namely: stirring speed, stirring time and preheat temperature. An experimental design using Box-Bernken Design was used to develop an RSM model for modeling the variations in the mechanical properties of the fiberboard in response to variations in process parameters. An ANN model was equally used to predict the properties of the composite. Subsequently the ANN was used as the fitness function for multi objective optimization of the produced composite using NSGA-II. The results of the study showed that RSM effectively modeled the properties of the composite. Also the correlation coefficient of the experimental responses and ANN predictions of the properties were excellent with the minimum value being 0.9982. The optimized Pareto front of the NSGA-II algorithm would be an excellent design guide for practical applications of Al 6351/ Egg Shell Reinforced composite in engineering design.

AB  - This study presents the development and evaluation of a novel shell-and-tube heat exchanger (STHX) design with segmental porous baffles. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in combination with machine learning tools are utilized to investigate the thermo-hydraulic impacts of segmental porous baffles on shell side flow of a STHX. Three geometric parameters (number of baffles, baffle angle, and baffle thickness) of these baffles, which are placed inside the STHX, are selected to perform the parametric study and multi-objective optimization. Higher number of baffles are beneficial to increase the rate of heat exchange; however, it would escalate the pressure drop considerably. Results also show that baffles angle plays a critical role on the performance of a STHX. An artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to predict the system’s performance. As lowering the pressure drop and increasing the heat transfer are the two main objectives in STHX, a multi-objective optimization study is conducted. Different decision-making algorithms are also applied to find the best alternative among the Pareto frontier points. Results of optimization show that a STHX with 10 porous baffles, baffle angle of 111.9, and baffle thickness of 16.69 mm would be the best geometrical configuration which results in a heat transfer rate of 523.81 kW while the pressure drop of the shell side flow would be 48.87 kPa. With this novel design, it is also possible to improve both pressure drop and heat transfer rate of STHX, simultaneously. A particular configuration of the introduced STHX could reduce the pressure drop by 61.3% while heat transfer enhances by 11.15% simultaneously.

KW  - Multi-criteria decision-making techniques
AB  - Due to the devastating ecological effects and constrained reserves of fossil fuels, renewable energies are now globally accepted as viable alternative sources of energy. Among renewable energy sources, wind energy has become globally popular, primarily because wind farms can be rapidly built and easily maintained at a relatively low cost. Wind-powered hydrogen production is an effective solution for storing the excess energy output of wind farms. The hydrogen produced in this way can be used not only in fuel cells but also in cooling, oil, gas, and petrochemical fields. As a country devastated by war and instability, Afghanistan has major energy generation challenges and a substantially large power supply deficiency. However, there are good wind energy potentials in several parts of this country. There are also several hydrogen-consuming fields in Afghanistan that can benefit from hydrogen production from wind energy. This paper endeavored to distinguish the appropriate areas in Afghanistan for harvesting wind energy for hydrogen production using multi-criteria decision-making techniques. Eleven criteria were utilized to prioritize 20 Afghan provinces with wind energy potential. The Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) was utilized to weight the criteria and Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) were utilized to prioritize the provinces. Then, ARAS, TOPSIS, and VIKOR methods were used to validate the resultants. For criteria weighting with SWARA, “wind speed”, “wind power density” and “area of windy regions” with weights of 0.1423, 0.1356, and 0.1221 were introduced as the most significant criteria for this ranking. In all the rankings, Herat, Farah, and Jowzjan were identified as the top three most suitable provinces for wind power generation. The power output and hydrogen output to be achieved in Herat province using a 900-kW turbine were estimated to 2558.4 MW per year and 41.4 tons per year, respectively.

AB  - Cloud service selection process is significantly challenging and complicated as there are various QoS factors to consider when selecting cloud services. This paper proposes a new QoS-aware selection model systematically and succinctly representing QoS attributes which cloud consumers can easily use and understand when selecting cloud services. In order to ensure the credibility of the cloud service selection, the proposed model collects QoS data from different sources including cloud providers, users’ reviews and cloud monitoring tools. It implements Multi-Criteria Decision Making models in order to rank services based on various QoS attributes. The proposed model is implemented as a simulation tool which is deployed on Amazon cloud platform. Using the simulation tool, the proposed model is rigorously evaluated through a number of experiments by taking into account data from widely used commercial cloud service providers. The experimental results show that the proposed model ranks and selects cloud services according to the QoS requirements of cloud service consumers. Unlike existing approaches the proposed model takes into account multi-level QoS attributes and data from real cloud providers when ranking cloud services.

AB  - Bio-medical waste (BMW) management is highly important precaution for human health and environmental concern. There are several disposal treatment followed by medical practitioners in medical waste management. Here, a few disposal treatment is considered to be an alternatives. When assessing, it is necessary to evaluate and assume that all disposal treatment methods are safe and hygienic. In this way, every alternative assessment is evaluated based on the social acceptance, technology and operation, environmental protection, cost, noise and health risk. Finally the best alternative is chosen. When BMW is disposed and we select the best treatment method in BMW management, it can lead to multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) processes related to uncertain critical assessments. When making a decision, the decision makers having some hesitation to give their suggestions. Therefore, here we use hesitant MCDM method. In today’s practice we have choose five methods of BMW disposal methods used in the medical world and we have its alternatives. One of these alternative is sorted by six criteria weights for selecting the best method. The main aim of this research paper is propose a new methodology of hesitant fuzzy weight finding technique, it is named as Hesitant Fuzzy Subjective and Objective Weight Integrated Approach (HF-SOWIA) and also propose a new hesitant fuzzy rank finding methodology, it is named as Hesitant Fuzzy Multi-Objective Optimization on the basis of Simple Ratio Analysis (HF-MOOSRA). After evaluation, the result shows that autoclaving is the best alternative for BMW disposal treatment methods. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is make in order to observe the difference of alternative ranking when the importance of subjective and objective weights changes.

AB  - In this paper, a two step multi-objective optimization framework of renewable energy planning is proposed for Turkey. In the first step, optimization process is performed and in the second step a multi-criteria decision making based selection strategy is applied to select a solution from non-dominated solution set. The objectives are selected as minimization of levelized cost of electricity plan and maximization of short term electricity generation from renewable energy resources. The optimization model considers different cases of renewable energy investment expenditures and the optimal use of resource availability according to renewable energy related targets of the country and estimated cost reduction due to technological learning. For optimization purposes, a state-of-the-art metaheuristic Competitive Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimizer (CMOPSO) is used. Results reveal that the 2023 targets of Turkey for hydroelectric, and biomass power plants are not optimal with any of the renewable energy investment case. In addition, solar photovoltaics and onshore wind energy should be the most preferred renewable resources. The findings of this paper can help decision makers not only to set optimized and reliable energy-related goals for Turkey but also to estimate the most suitable time for diffusion of offshore wind energy technology which is not currently under operation.

AB  - The growing demand and exigency for groundwater resources warrant the demarcation of groundwater spring potential zones (GSPZ) for effective sustainable strategy in groundwater identification, conservation, and management. Here we utilized a novel data mining (DM) ensemble to generate groundwater spring potential maps (GSPMs) by combining RF-BRT (random forest-boosted regression tree), MARS-SVM (multivariate adaptive regression spline-support vector machine) and, FDA-GLM-MDA (functional data analysis-generalized linear model-mixture discriminant analysis). Initially, an aggregate of 1726 groundwater spring locations was collected from the regional water company of Tehran Province and field investigation, in which 1208 springs (70%) were taken for training purposes and the remaining 518 (30%) springs were applied for the validation process. Twelve conditioning factors including DEM (digital elevation model)/elevation, fault density, aspect, rainfall, distance from rivers, distance from faults, slope, MRVBF (multiresolution index of valley bottom flatness), TWI (topographic wetness index), lithology, land use/land cover, and permeability were utilized for mapping process and their importance in predicting the groundwater spring potential. The variable importance (VI) analysis using SVM (support vector machine) reveals that the most significant conditioning factors in the prediction process are rainfall, TWI, DEM-elevation, distance from rivers, slope, distance from faults, and MRVBF. The GSPMs generated from novel data-mining (DM) ensembles were validated using the cut-off reliant (recall, fallout, F-measure, accuracy, precision, specificity, TSS: true skill statistic, Cohen’s kappa, fourfold plot, CCI: corrected classified instances) and cut-off independent (ROC-AUC: receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve) measures. The outcome of the validation measures shows that RF-BRT has the superior values of recall, F-measure, overall accuracy, precision, specificity, TSS, Cohen’s kappa, fourfold plot, CCI followed by MARS-SVM, and FDA-GLM-MDA whereas the AUC value of RF-BRT (0.955), MARS-SVM (0.934), and FDA-GLM-MDA (0.914) also display similar result. The GSPMs generated using the novel DM ensemble models in our study can be utilized by policymakers in implementing the strategies for effective land use planning and sustainable groundwater management.

AB  - Introduction
The concept of a smart city is fast becoming a key instrument in transforming living environments in a better way to enhance the operational efficiency of a transportation system. This paper presents a framework to assess transportation performance measures and smart-growth of cities around the U.S. by including physical activity as one of the main criteria.
Methods
This study employs Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) as a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method. The proposed assessment framework is comprised of the evaluation of an individual criterion and the assessment of comprehensive results. The criteria are categorized into four groups including network performance, traffic safety, environmental impact, and physical activity. As a case example, the proposed performance measures were examined for forty-six cities in the U.S., and the required data was gathered from multiple sources.
Results
The output of the framework contains sustainability and smart-growth rankings of the selected cities as well as uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis was utilized to determine the quantity that each performance measure or weighting factor requires to alter the smart-growth score. It has been illustrated that the dominancy between reversible pairs in the ranking is critically sensitive for almost 15% of cases.
Conclusion
The results of the proposed framework can be an effective decision supporting tool in analyzing traffic management strategies. Results from the score sensitivity calculation indicate that the proposed framework can be adopted in multifaceted transportation system performance in sustainability and smart-growth of cities.

AB  - Urban waterlogging is a hydrological cycle problem that seriously affects people's life and property. Characterizing waterlogging variation and explicit its driving factors are conducive to prevent the damage of such disasters. Conventional methods, because of the high spatial heterogeneity and the non-stationary complex mechanism of urban waterlogging, are not able to fully capture the urban waterlogging spatial variation and identify the waterlogging susceptibility areas. A more robust method is recommended to quantify the variation trend of urban waterlogging. Previous studies have simulated the waterlogging variation in relatively small areas. However, the relationship between variables is often ignored, which cannot comprehensively reveal the dominant drivers affecting urban waterlogging. Therefore, a novel approach is proposed that combined stepwise cluster analysis model (SCAM) and hierarchical partitioning analysis (HPA) within a general framework and verifies the applicability through logistic regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine. According to the dominant driving factors, different simulation scenarios are established to analyze waterlogging density variation. Results found that the SCAM provides accurate and detailed simulated results both in urban centers where waterlogging frequently occurs and urban fringe with few waterlogging events, which shows an excellent performance with a high classification accuracy and generalization capability. HPA detected that the impervious surface abundance (28.07%), vegetation abundance (20.80%), and cumulate precipitation (16.25%) are the dominant drivers of waterlogging. This result suggests that priority should be given to controlling these three factors to mitigate the risk of waterlogging. It is interesting to note that under different urbanization and rainfall scenarios, the urban waterlogging susceptibility has a considerable variation. The watershed spatial location and watershed characteristics are relevant aspects to be considered in identifying and assessing waterlogging susceptibility, which provides original insights that urban waterlogging mitigation strategies should be developed according to different local conditions and future scenarios.

AB  - Democratization of sensing devices in industrial systems has made it possible to collect a large amount of data of different types, which has led to the necessity of handling complex analyses for knowledge extraction. The field of water resources is of those areas which has drawn the attention of decision-makers seeking to preserve human health and safety. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in the domain of Machine Learning, have opened the potential to leverage massive data to better address the issue related to the relationship between water quality and human activities. However, high rate of missing data and heterogeneity of the measurements are scientific issues that cannot be solved by standard methods, especially when no prior knowledge on the label of each observation is provided. In this article, Prognostics and Health Management was implemented to detect and diagnose anomalies in water quality datasets, taking into account the uncertainties induced by the above-mentioned issues. Fuzzy c-means was used to identify the different water quality classes, while Random Forest was applied to determine the most influencing parameters, with respect to potential contamination of water resources in the southwest of France. The results suggest that multiple imputation methods can handle the missingness issue, while the use of decision rules based on well-known water quality standards can solve the problem regarding the lack of labelled observations. In addition, two potential sources of contamination (atrazine and nitrate) were identified and then validated by hydrogeology experts, prior to further online deployment of the proposed model.

AB  - The present research examines the landslide susceptibility in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, India using the conditional probability (CP) statistical technique, the boost regression tree (BRT) machine learning algorithm, and the CP-BRT ensemble approach to improve the accuracy of the BRT model. Using the four fold of data, the models' outcomes were cross-checked.The locations of existing landslides were detected by general field surveys and relevant records. 220 previous landslide locations were obtained, presented as an inventory map, and divided into four folds to calibrate and authenticate the models. For modelling the landslide susceptibility, twelve LCFs (landslide conditioning factors) were used. Two statistical methods, i.e. the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error ( RMSE), one statistical test, i.e. the Freidman rank test, as well as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), efficiency and precision were used for authenticating the produced landslide models. The results of the accuracy measures revealed that all models have good potential to recognize the landslide susceptibility in the Garhwal Himalayan region. Among these models, the ensemble model achieved a higher accuracy (precision: 0.829, efficiency: 0.833, AUC: 89.460, RMSE: 0.069 and MAE: 0.141) than the individual models. According to the outcome of the ensemble simulations, the BRT model’ predictive accuracy was enhancedby integrating it with the statistical model (CP). The study showed that the areas of fallow land, plantation fields, and roadsides with elevations of more than 1500 m. with steep slopes of 24° to 87 ° and eroding hills are highly susceptible to landslides. The findings of this work could help in minimizing the landslides’ risk in the Western Himalaya and its adjoining areas with similar landscapes and geological characteristics.

AB  - The hybrid of AHP and TOPSIS has led researchers to integrate the combination with different extensions of fuzzy sets. The recently developed three-dimensional spherical fuzzy set is an extension of the fuzzy set, which is effective in handling uncertainty and quantifying expert judgements. In this paper, a novel framework is elaborated which combines AHP and TOPSIS with a spherical fuzzy set. Spherical fuzzy AHP is used to calculate the spherical fuzzy weights of the criteria, while spherical fuzzy TOPSIS is used to find the final rank of the alternatives. A new spherical fuzzy geometric mean formula is proposed for calculating the spherical fuzzy criteria weights. A new eleven-point spherical fuzzy linguistic term scale is presented, which can be used by the experts to quantify the preference. The proposed framework is applied to an advanced manufacturing system selection problem with six evaluation criteria and four alternatives. It is found that spherical fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS is effective in handling uncertainty in decision making and leads to robust and competitive results compared with state-of-the-art multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches.

AB  - Natural hazards are often studied in isolation. However, there is a great need to examine hazards holistically to better manage the complex of threats found in any region. Many regions of the world have complex hazard landscapes wherein risk from individual and/or multiple extreme events is omnipresent. Extensive parts of Iran experience a complex array of natural hazards – floods, earthquakes, landslides, forest fires, subsidence, and drought. The effectiveness of risk mitigation is in part a function of whether the complex of hazards can be collectively considered, visualized, and evaluated. This study develops and tests individual and collective multi-hazard risk maps for floods, landslides, and forest fires to visualize the spatial distribution of risk in Fars Province, southern Iran. To do this, two well-known machine-learning algorithms – SVM and MARS – are used to predict the distribution of these events. Past floods, landslides, and forest fires were surveyed and mapped. The locations of occurrence of these events (individually and collectively) were randomly separated into training (70%) and testing (30%) data sets. The conditioning factors (for floods, landslides, and forest fires) employed to model the risk distributions are aspect, elevation, drainage density, distance from faults, geology, LULC, profile curvature, annual mean rainfall, plan curvature, distance from man-made residential structures, distance from nearest river, distance from nearest road, slope gradient, soil types, mean annual temperature, and TWI. The outputs of the two models were assessed using receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves, true-skill statistics (TSS), and the correlation and deviance values from each models for each hazard. The areas-under-the-curves (AUC) for the MARS model prediction were 76.0%, 91.2%, and 90.1% for floods, landslides, and forest fires, respectively. Similarly, the AUCs for the SVM model were 75.5%, 89.0%, and 91.5%. The TSS reveals that the MARS model was better able to predict landslide risk, but was less able to predict flood-risk patterns and forest-fire risk. Finally, the combination of flood, forest fire, and landslide risk maps yielded a multi-hazard susceptibility map for the province. The better predictive model indicated that 52.3% of the province was at-risk for at least one of these hazards. This multi-hazard map may yield valuable insight for land-use planning, sustainable development of infrastructure, and also integrated watershed management in Fars Province.

AB  - Observation of global smart city trends shows a shift in focus from sector-based interventions towards integrated decision-making informed by Big Data. This move towards integration is evident in the emergence of Integrated City Management Platforms (ICMPs). Despite the deluge of data generated by ICMPs and the accompanying growth in computing power, limited research has been conducted on exploring the use of this data to develop quantitative tools for integrated smart city planning and management. In this study, the Design Science Research process was followed to develop and evaluate a modelling framework aimed at exploring the use of ICMP data to identify synergies and dependencies across smart city sectors. This paper provides a summary of framework design and implementation and discusses the Design Science Knowledge gained from the exercise.

From there we follow the developments in the 1980s and the benchmarks in Europe in the 1990s revealing the large differences in outcomes when various teams work out the risks of a same plant. It showed the uncertainties intrinsic to the methodology of that time. The last 2 decades have seen various kinds of improvements but also awareness that other factors, such as human failure and organizational ones are important to include. The last subchapter is highlighting approaches partly based on machine learning and artificial intelligence that will make use of “big data,” even enabling dynamic operational risk assessment.

AB  - Optimization problems with improper expression of constraints exist widely in practical engineering. In order to achieve a reasonable degree of constraints satisfaction, this paper investigates a single-valued neutrosophic optimization method to deal with system uncertainty. Firstly, an equivalent model based on single-valued neutrosophic entropy is proposed to transform the original problem into a crisp multi-objective optimization problem. The Pareto-front of the optimization problem is then obtained by a multi-objective state transition algorithm. Finally, the best solution is determined by a multi-criteria decision making method. A practical example of a zinc electrowinning process is used to illustrate the effectiveness and advantage of the developed new optimization approach, which provides a more cost-effective solution to decrease the electricity utility charge and satisfy the daily output production requirements.

AB  - This numerical study covers the engine performance and emissions of a dual-fuel compression-ignition engine fueled by hydrogen/diesel mixtures. Advanced simulations of the combustion process were performed by focusing on simulating the engine performance and emissions at different hydrogen quantities. Different factors that have significant effects on engine performance and emissions, such as exhaust gas recirculation and modifying diesel injection timing (IT), were also considered in this study. The relationship between the performance, emissions, and the operating parameters considered in this work are investigated and explained. A significant reduction of soot emissions by approximately 32.5% has been achieved by increasing hydrogen levels up to 37.5%; however, this has led to an increase in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions by ~22%. To overcome this problem, the optimum operating parameters that will lead to minimum emissions and maximum efficiency were also sought. Hydrogen rates, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates, and diesel injection timing were the main operating conditions while the engine performance and NOx/soot emissions were the objectives. The best operating conditions for hydrogen/diesel engines were obtained by solving the multi-objective problem of maximizing the efficiency while minimizing the NOx and soot emissions. This multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) with conflicting objectives was solved by using different optimization techniques, including regression analysis, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms. By solving MOOP, the first preferred operating condition at ~13% hydrogen, 4% EGR, and 30 BTDC of diesel injection timing was obtained.

AB  - When manufacturing a product, companies must consider the specifications of its design and choose the manufacturing technology that matches them the best in terms of product quality, production time and costs. Since all these parameters can be represented by several different and conflicting indicators, the problem of technology selection can be defined as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Although several mathematical models have been developed to solve similar problems, recent literature still presents a lack of specific applications of renowned decision-making techniques to the technology matching problem in the manufacturing sector. This study attempts to fill this gap by proposing a manufacturing-oriented model of the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS), one of the most solid and robust MCDM methods. The solution we present, which is designed for general manufacturing processes, has been applied to the specific case of a producer of food and beverage plants and equipment that is interested in reengineering one of its products. Due to the complexity of the food and beverage industry, the case study is useful for supporting the definition of the general model and validating its applicability. Further, the results of the specific application prove the effectiveness of our model.
