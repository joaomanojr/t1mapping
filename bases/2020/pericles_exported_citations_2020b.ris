N2  - Summary Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is merely a structured method to think about multi-criteria problems, comes to some ranking of alternatives but all it provides insight in why one action or alternative is preferable over another. Most business problems are MCDA problems. In this chapter, the authors present a ? personal ? view on how such structured approach should look like. The first step is to get the big picture and explore possible alternatives. Multiple methods have been proposed and used in most corporations. Methods such as SWOT analysis for example can be used to investigate ideas, identify new ideas, focus ideas, etc. These methods explore ideas but are no decision models in itself. The authors use brainstorm sessions, focus groups to evaluate the existing shared service centres and have come up with the list of relevant criteria: talent, stability, cost, cost inflation, travel, time-zone, infrastructure, and life quality.

N2  - Summary The emergence of data engineering along with the support of Online Social Networks is growing by millions every day due to the introduction of wireless systems and Internet of Things. The rapid growth of usage of smart devices helps to create new generation knowledge sharing platforms. Data Analytics has a major role to play in the growth and success of wireless and IoT applications. The growth of data has become exponential and is difficult to analyze. Many researchers depend on the data available on Wireless Systems and IoT for developing new generation services and applications. With the opportunity of information and communication technologies like heterogeneous networking, cloud computing, web services, crowd sensing and data mining, ubiquitous and asynchronous information sharing is feasible. But this also brings out a lot of provocations with respect to conflicting standards, data portability, data aggregation, data distribution, differential context and communication overhead. The smart information and communication technology has changed many features of human lifestyle: personal and work places.

N2  - The paper examines the performance of Indian private sector banks based on various combinations of multi-criteria decision-making techniques. Annual reports of the respective banks were used to capture the data and measure the performance by considering multiple inputs and outputs. The data are analyzed through notable multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, CRITIC, TOPSIS, and grey relational analysis (GRA). The study reveals that HDFC is the best performing bank among other private sector banks and creates a benchmark. Applying the combination of MCDM techniques, namely CRITIC-TOPSIS and CRITIC-GRA, HDFC is ranked first followed by Bandhan Bank as the second. Other banks are ranked differently due to methodological differences. After obtaining the ranks by CRITIC-TOPSIS and CRITIC-GRA, the ranks are tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Only private sector banks are considered for the current study. Future studies on the performance of banks can be taken up by comparing different types of banks, targeting an extension of the time frame studied. The findings suggest that the private sector banks need to increase their performance by investing in income-generating areas. Improving the performance will help them in surviving in the market as well as competing with the top public sector and foreign banks. The findings can also be useful to various stakeholders and, in particular, to investors to know the value of the banks for future investments. For the first time, researchers have used a combination of MCDM techniques such as CRITIC-TOPSIS and CRITIC-GRA. Selected inputs and outputs have been studied for the private sector banks using MCDM techniques to measure the performance.

N2  - Abstract Big data adoption (BDA) and its barriers, opportunities, and expected benefits are increasingly attracting researchers' and practitioners' attention. For developing economies, BDA has special importance; however, they have struggled to identify the barriers hindering it. This study aims to identify the barriers to BDA in developing economies and their relative importance across sectors to identify sectors' readiness for BDA. Based on a review of the BDA literature, semi-structured interviews with big data (BD) experts, and a questionnaire-based survey, five barrier sets, and 19 sub-barriers were identified. Thereafter, barrier sets for each sector were identified, analyzed, discussed, and compared. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to identify the relative importance of these barriers across sectors, while the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was used to rank sectors according to their readiness for BDA. This study positions itself as a reference for scholars and practitioners interested in BDA in developing economies.

N2  - Architectured beam lattice materials whose anisotropy can be tuned by varying the composition of their elementary cell are investigated. As an exemplary prototype of such material architecture, a regular triangular lattice with an elementary cell composed of 12 beams is considered. One out of three possible values of the elastic modulus is assigned to each beam. The structure is fully defined by a vector in the 12D composition-structure space whose components are given by the elastic modulus values of the beams comprising the elementary cell. The elastic properties of this 2D material are represented by the compliance elasticity tensor with six independent compliance coefficients. Aiming at a specific set of properties thus involves finding the point in the 12D composition-structure space that corresponds to a given point in the 6D property space. This is a problem of large dimensionality. To solve it, the neural network approach is used. This enables creation of architectured materials with tunable elastic anisotropy. A chiral element combining large twist with additional anisotropy requirements is presented as an example of successful machine-learning-based optimization of beam lattices proposed.

N2  - Summary In the early days of machine learning, one focused on creating algorithms that could mimic human brain function, and achieve a form of artificial intelligence. A decision tree is an example of inductive machine learning. It is one of the most intuitive decision tree methods and in fact many heuristics from bird determination to medical treatment are often summarized in decision trees when humans have to learn. Random forests are a way of averaging multiple deep decision trees, trained on different parts of the same training set, with the goal of reducing the variance (by averaging the trees). Artificial neural networks not only display similarities with our brain in the way they are designed, but also display the ability to ?learn? from examples. Support vector machines are a supervised learning technique that is capable of solving both classification and regression problems.

N2  - Abstract Nowadays, fierce competition enforces supply chain planners to develop market-oriented production strategies. Customer order decoupling point (CODP) could increase the supply chain efficiency and responsiveness simultaneously. The right position of CODP in production industries will result in a pattern for trade-off between responsiveness and operational efficiency. The purpose of this paper is to address the positioning problem of a push-pull boundary in a fuzzy hesitant environment. To this end, a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making methodology of analytic network process (ANP) and VIKOR is proposed in a hesitant judgement environment to determine the position of CODP in a supply chain. Finally, CODP positioning in the apparel supply chain, as an industry-based example, is analysed to show the applicability of the proposed method.

N2  - Abstract This paper presents a novel method for the development of an optimal water supply plan showcased using data from the Gamasiab basin, located in Kermanshah province, Iran, concerning new dams that are being constructed in this semi-arid region. In this paper, a new group multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) plan is proposed by combining two MCDM methods based on the fuzzy Delphi and fuzzy ELECTRE III methods that convert the experts' opinions to triangular fuzzy numbers based on the level of uncertainty associated with various quantitative and qualitative criteria. Considering the opinions of four non-stakeholder experts and data analysis using the fuzzy Delphi method, the criteria were evaluated. Then, by analysing the results using the fuzzy ELECTRE III method, the final ranking of scenarios is obtained. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effect of uncertainty on the performance of the decision-making system in scenarios ranking. The total expense, flood control, reservoir capacity and diversion and water transfer played a significant role in selecting the optimal scenario. Additionally, a hydrologic model was developed to evaluate the performance of the optimal scenario in terms of qualitative criteria. The data indicated that there was a good agreement between the results obtained from the hydrological model and the scenario ranking by the employed method. Altogether, a comparison of the proposed method with other MCDM methods, including fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy technique for order preference by simulation of ideal solution, indicated that the results of the employed method matched more closely to the local experts' opinion.

N2  - Abstract A complex Pythagorean fuzzy set, an extension of Pythagorean fuzzy set, is a powerful tool to handle two dimension phenomenon. Dombi operators with operational parameters have outstanding flexibility. This article presents certain aggregation operators under complex Pythagorean fuzzy environment, including complex Pythagorean Dombi fuzzy weighted arithmetic averaging (CPDFWAA) operator, complex Pythagorean Dombi fuzzy weighted geometric averaging (CPDFWGA) operator, complex Pythagorean Dombi fuzzy ordered weighted arithmetic averaging (CPDFOWAA) operator and complex Pythagorean Dombi fuzzy ordered weighted geometric averaging (CPDFOWGA) operator. Moreover, this paper explores some fundamental properties of these operators with appropriate elaboration. A decision-making numerical example related to the selection of bank to purchase loan is given to demonstrate the significance of our proposed approach. Finally, a comparative analysis with existing operators is given to demonstrate the peculiarity of our proposed operators.

N2  - Abstract Soils are indispensable for the provision of several functions. Agricultural intensification and its focus on increasing primary productivity (PP) poses a threat to soil quality, due to increases in nutrient loads, greenhouse gas emissions and declining biodiversity. The EU Horizon 2020 Landmark project has developed multi-criteria decision models to assess five soil functions: PP, nutrient cycling (NC), soil biodiversity and habitat provision (B-HP), climate mitigation and water regulation, simultaneously in agricultural fields. Using these algorithms, we evaluated the supply of PP, NC and B-HP of 31 grasslands and 21 croplands as low, medium or high. The multi-criteria decision models showed that 38% of the farms had a medium to high supply of all three soil functions, whereas only one cropland had a high supply for all three. Forty-eight per cent of the farms were characterized by a high supply of PP and NC. We observed a clear trade-off between these two functions and B-HP. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated that higher organic inputs combined with a lower mineral fertilization concur with higher biodiversity scores while maintaining a medium delivery of PP and NC. Additionally, we compared the outputs of the model predictions to independent variables that served as proxies for the soil functions and found: (a) croplands (but not grasslands) with high PP had a higher standardized yield than those with medium PP; (b) grasslands (but not croplands) with high NC had a significantly lower fungal to bacterial biomass ratio, suggesting faster decomposition channels; and (c) a positive though non-significant trend between B-HP score and rank according to soil invertebrate biodiversity. These comparisons suggest a successful upscaling of the models from field to farm level. Our study highlights the need for systematic collection of management-related data for the assessment of soil functions. Multifunctionality can be achieved in agricultural soils; however, without specifically managing for it, biodiversity might come at a loss. Highlights We study how well soils can provide primary productivity, nutrient cycling and biodiversity. We study trade-offs and synergies among soil functions, as well as the drivers of these relationships. Soil biodiversity is largely sacrificed for primary productivity and nutrient cycling Changes in pesticide and fertilizer management can increase soil multifunctionality.

N2  - Abstract Eutrophication and sporadic algal blooms occurring in the tributary bays of the Three Gorges Reservoir in Hubei, China, have become major environmental issues following impoundment. However, predicting eutrophication with traditional methods based on monthly monitoring data remains challenging. In order to explore the potential of data-driven models in eutrophication prediction and establish reliable prediction data-driven model based on monthly monitoring data. In this study, two ensemble-learning models, random forests (RF) and gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT), were used to predict eutrophication in Zhuyi Bay. To address the target, three objectives were solved. First, RF and GBDT used to regress chlorophyll-a concentrations showed good model fit across two monitoring data sets, with R2 values of 0.809 and 0.822 for RF and 0.824 and 0.828 for GBDT. Second, the relative variable importance plots computed by ensemble-learning models was calculated for selecting monitoring parameters and identify drivers of eutrophication. To improve model fit, it was more important to monitor key parameters of eutrophication (such as water transparency) than to increase sample size. Third, K-Means++ modelling was used to partition eutrophication data into discrete levels. For three eutrophication levels, the classification accuracies of RF and GBDT were 0.8936 and 0.9064, respectively. When using only two eutrophication levels, accuracies for both models increased to 0.9617. This study suggests that ensemble-learning models, and in particular GBDT (firstly used in eutrophication), show excellent fitting ability for eutrophication compared with other machine-learning models and provided reliable eutrophication prediction method based on monthly monitoring data.

N2  - Abstract The United States' National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to use environmental impact assessment tools to aggregate scientific information, garner stakeholder input, and weigh alternatives for infrastructure siting and operations decisions.Thus, NEPA plays a sweeping role in federal infrastructure provisioning. Using a comprehensive dataset of Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) prepared under NEPA from 2013 to 2019, we use natural language processing to identify geographic locations and artificial neural networks to classify discussed environmental impacts. We then describe geographic, temporal, and environmental trends in federal infrastructure provisioning. Finally, we use Bayesian hierarchical regression to assess how socio-economic and demographic covariates shape county-level EIS counts. Numerous federal agencies are involved in EIS production, but three agencies author the majority of EISs. Total EISs issued annually have declined since the early 2000s. EISs are more frequent in urban coastal counties, but do not show clear distributive trends by income or race.

N2  - Abstract Deep learning is a powerful technology that enables intelligent data processing in the smart healthcare domain. Inspired by the tremendous processing power of cloud computing, the training process and the model repository of deep learning are moved to the cloud. Cloud-assisted deep learning applications enable smart mobile users to experience quick predictive results. Health professionals use smart mobile devices to convey recordings of the patient and to receive the best inference results. The mobility of these devices causes severe performance degradation as it increases the distance between its current location and the edge cloud where the virtual machines are provisioned. Therefore, mobility-based resource provisioning to identify a suitable server based on deadline constraints, available resources, and cost metrics is crucial. This paper proposes a proximity-based resource provisioning technique that guarantees minimal delay in obtaining inference results with a local mobile cloud system. The proposed technique comprises two algorithms (a) deadline-based initial resource provisioning and (b) resource migration and provisioning at suitable cloudlet during location change. The proposed technique is implemented in a mobile cloud platform running the inference method of a smart mobile healthcare application. The performance results show that the proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of the response time, deadline meeting percentage, and system utilization.

N2  - Abstract Battery module safety is a major concern for the commercial success of electric vehicles (EVs). Concurrently, it is also important to have a mechanically sound and ergonomically fit battery pack design. To solve this problem, a hybrid multi-output-predictive modelling based NSGA II approach is proposed. In this approach, the multiple predictive modelling methods (linear regression, regression with AdaBoost, decision tree regression and multi-layer perceptron [MLP]) are applied to predict the deformation, natural frequency and mass of battery pack enclosure. By performing the comparative analysis of these methods, the decision tree regression model was selected for deformation, MLP with tanh function for frequency and MLP with ReLU function for mass. Further, these selected models were optimized using NSGA II which resulted in optimum combination of input variables for achieving the maximum deformation (0.0019?m), minimum natural frequency (91.60?Hz), and mass (12.41?kg) simultaneously.

N2  - Summary Despite the impact of personnel scheduling on the sustainability of production processes, it is a rarely studied problem in the electricity generation sector, whose main purpose is sustainable energy generation. From this point of view, personnel scheduling problem is handled in this study based on the impact of this problem, which focuses on fair and balanced job distribution according to the personnel qualifications, on the sustainable generation in the power plants. With its advantages such as ease of operation and maintenance, fast commissioning, lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to other fossil fuels and etc. one of the biggest Natural Gas Combined Cycle Power Plant (NGCCPP) in Turkey is chosen as application area. The main purpose of the study is to demonstrate the effect of fair, balanced and competency-based personnel scheduling on generation stoppages resulting from personnel planning in power plants, which have great importance in energy supply security of the countries. This study is the first in the literature in terms of three different aspects. Firstly, in the energy sector, it is different in that it is a personnel scheduling study that takes into consideration the job assignment of the personnel according to their abilities and minimizes costs. Secondly, the large size of the problem is different from that of previous studies in the literature. Finally, the number of personnel employed in this generation facility varies according to the season. At this point, the past generation data are analyzed using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method and an estimation is made, and personnel scheduling is performed in the light of this information. Consequently, the proposed multi-objective mathematical model supported with multi-criteria decision making and ANN, shutdown rate of the power plant due to operator error is reduced 67.3%, and personnel satisfaction level is increased from 42% to 89%as solution.

N2  - Abstract The interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (IVq-ROFS) and complex fuzzy set (CFS) are two generalizations of the fuzzy set (FS) to cope with uncertain information in real decision making problems. The aim of the present work is to develop the concept of complex interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (CIVq-ROFS) as a generalization of interval-valued complex fuzzy set (IVCFS) and q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS), which can better express the time-periodic problems and two-dimensional information in a single set. In this article not only basic properties of CIVq-ROFSs are discussed but also averaging aggregation operator (AAO) and geometric aggregation operator (GAO) with some desirable properties and operations on CIVq-ROFSs are discussed. The proposed operations are the extension of the operations of IVq-ROFS, q-ROFS, interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy, Pythagorean fuzzy (PF), interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy, intuitionistic fuzzy, complex q-ROFS, complex PF, and complex intuitionistic fuzzy theories. Further, the Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method are also examine based on CIVq-ROFS to explore the reliability and proficiency of the work. Moreover, we discussed the advantages of CIVq-ROFS and showed that the concepts of IVCFS and q-ROFS are the special cases of CIVq-ROFS. Moreover, the flexibility of proposed averaging aggregation operator and geometric aggregation operator in a multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problem are also discussed. Finally, a comparative study of CIVq-ROFSs with pre-existing work is discussed in detail.

N2  - Climate change constitutes a relevant driver of emerging risks. While a broad range of forward-looking studies and reports examine the impact of climate change on food security, future challenges for food and feed safety, plant and animal health and nutritional quality are usually not investigated in depth.The CLimate change and Emerging risks for Food SAfety (CLEFSA) project has explored the possibility of: (a) using the specific driver, climate change, for long-term anticipation of multiple emerging risks, using scenarios of climate change; (b) using crowdsourcing and text mining to collect a broad range of signals from a variety of information sources; (c) using a knowledge network of experts from international organisations; (d) designing a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis tool for characterising signals through a participatory process, in which expert knowledge is used to identify relevant issues from the vast and often incomplete information; (e) developing methodologies and indicators for the analysis of the information available, addressing uncertainty.Climate change and its implications for food safety demand complex scientific study, given the number and diversity of hazards to be considered, the large uncertainties involved and the interconnections between the different areas. The effects of climate change are characterised by a multidisciplinary nature (human?plant?animal health and environmental sciences) and go beyond the recognition of specific emerging risks. CLEFSA has identified numerous issues that are driven by climate change and that may affect food safety in Europe. Climate change has the potential of causing, enhancing or modifying the occurrence and intensity of some food-borne diseases and the establishment of invasive alien species harmful to plant and animal health. It has an impact on the occurrence, intensity and toxicity of blooms of potentially toxic marine and freshwater algae and bacteria, on the dominance and persistence of various parasites, fungi, viruses, vectors and invasive species, harmful to plant and animal health. Climate change is likely to drive the (re)emergence of new hazards, increase the exposure or the susceptibility to known hazards and change the levels of micronutrients and macronutrients in food and feed items. By the very nature of the challenge, this list is inevitably incomplete, and undoubtedly unanticipated surprises await us in the future.

N2  - The study aims to rank the performance of Indian private sector banks on the basis of their financial capability. The study is focussed on those banks which are listed in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), for the period from 2014?15 to 2018?19. The financial performance of selected Indian private banks is ranked using a hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique, that is, AHP-TOPSIS. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to determine the weights of 10 financial performance pointers, and further Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used to provide rankings and benchmarking of the private sector banks. Thereafter, overall ranking is given to the selected banks using interval-valued TOPSIS (IV-TOPSIS) for a combined period of 5?years. Sensitivity analysis has been performed to check the robustness of the method and its impact on the final ranking of the banks. Results showed that HDFC bank is the top performer and is ranked first for all the years consecutively during the period 2014?2019 and has set a financial indicator benchmark for other competitor banks. South Indian Bank showed the worst results in each year and stood last in the overall ranking. The IndusInd bank is followed after HDFC bank by improving its performance from 2014?19. With a slight margin, Kotak Mahindra Bank ranked after IndusInd. Through the AHP-TOPSIS technique, each year the private sector banks ranking differs among themselves depending upon the financial performance pointers. Based on interval-valued TOPSIS (IV-TOPSIS), it was found that the overall HDFC was the top-performing bank and South Indian Bank was the worst-performing bank among all other banks. The results obtained from sensitivity analysis were found to be consistent with IV-TOPSIS. The paper used the AHP technique, which is subjective in nature, and the results depend on the opinion of the experts. This study will assist the investors who want to channelize their funds in private banks having shares enlisted in BSE. It will accommodate banks to compare and judge their financial performance along with improving their performance and planning their future strategy. AHP-TOPSIS utilized by past researchers is unable to bring out the cumulative performance for banks, but in this paper, IV-TOPSIS is utilized, which can be effectively used to evaluate the cumulative performance of banks. The study tries to fill the gap in the literature by providing the overall ranking to private sector banks in India on the basis of financial indicators.

N2  - Abstract The consensus-reaching process (CRP) to achieve higher unanimity and ensure common agreement before deriving a final decision has become an important procedure in group decision-making problems. The demand for high-quality decision results has motivated the development of large-scale group decision-making (LGDM). In such cases, the issue of minority opinion has gained awareness due to the related effects on enhancing consensus and decision quality. A minority opinion cannot exert an effect unless the majority attach importance to whether that opinion is supported or not. To reflect the effect of minority opinions on consensus, this paper establishes a LGDM framework with an objective and interactive-information-based feedback mechanism for the CRP. Given the natural forms of human expression, multi-granular linguistic information and a 2-tuple linguistic model are used. First, initial weights are objectively assigned to decision-makers (DMs) to weaken the impact of the majority. Subsequently, a non-support degree function is newly defined to reflect the extent to which other DMs dissent from a minority opinion. More importantly, feedback rules are constructed to make corresponding adjustments to the powers of discourse among all DMs in the attempt to reach consensus. Finally, the proposed three-phase LGDM framework is applied to new product development (NPD), and simulation experiments are conducted based on two algorithms to verify the framework's applicability and feasibility.

N2  - Summary This article proposes a random-forest based A2Cloud framework to match scientific applications with Cloud providers and their instances for high performance. The framework leverages four engines for this task: PERF engine, Cloud trace engine, A2Cloud-ext engine, and the random forest classifier (RFC) engine. The PERF engine profiles the application to obtain performance characteristics, including the number of single-precision (SP) floating-point operations (FLOPs), double-precision (DP) FLOPs, x87 operations, memory accesses, and disk accesses. The Cloud trace engine obtains the corresponding performance characteristics of the selected Cloud instances including: SP floating point operations per second (FLOPS), DP FLOPS, x87 operations per second, memory bandwidth, and disk bandwidth. The A2Cloud-ext engine uses the application and Cloud instance characteristics to generate objective scores that represent the application-to-Cloud match. The RFC engine uses these objective scores to generate two types of random forests to assist users with rapid analysis: application-specific random forests (ARF) and application-class based random forests. The ARF consider only the input application's characteristics to generate a random forest and provide numerical ratings to the selected Cloud instances. To generate the application-class based random forests, the RFC engine downloads the application profiles and scores of previously tested applications that perform similar to the input application. Using these data, the RFC engine creates a random forest for instance recommendation. We exhaustively test this framework using eight real-world applications across 12 instances from different Cloud providers. Our tests show significant statistical agreement between the instance ratings given by the framework and the ratings obtained via actual Cloud executions.

N2  - Abstract The assessments of flood-prone areas and flood risk due to pluvial flooding for Davao Oriental on Mindanao Island in the Philippines were carried out by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and maximum entropy (Maxent) models using multiple criteria such as slope, elevation, soil type, rainfall, drainage density, distance to the main channel, and population density. Flood records from 70 survey points were obtained and used to verify the model results. The criteria weights of the top three important factors in the AHP are rainfall (42%), slope (23%), and elevation (15%), whereas those in the Maxent model are elevation (36%), rainfall (23%), and soil (19%). The verification results show that the accuracies of the AHP and Maxent model are 81 and 95.6%, respectively, indicating that both approaches are reliable in flood hazard and risk assessments. Approximately 22% of the total area and approximately 30% of the total population of Davao Oriental are classified as high risk of pluvial flooding in the current situation by the AHP method. This study shows a broad-scale high-level data-driven screening method that can be used to help identify potential hot spots for pluvial flooding for which more detailed numerical modelling studies should be undertaken.

N2  - Uncertainty and vagueness are the important factors in any decision-making process. Different tools and approaches had been introduced to handle the uncertainty and vagueness environment of behaviour analysis. One of the latest tools in dealing with uncertainty and vagueness is Pythagorean fuzzy sets which are the generalized form of intuitionistic fuzzy set. In this paper, we explore the concept of Pythagorean fuzzy sets and introduce POS?NEG composition to determine the behaviour of customers in Amazon E-commerce website. The role of this enhanced composition is to gather the sentiment of customers about the Amazon products. Our proposed work handles multi-attribute, reduces complexity of the analysis and it is compared and proved to be accurate than fuzzy set and intuitionistic fuzzy set. The main feature of Pythagorean fuzzy sets is its relatively novel mathematical framework in the fuzzy family with higher ability to cope imprecision imbedded in decision-making.

N2  - Summary This chapter introduces AdaptFog, a distributed reputation system for quality of service (QoS)-aware service choreography in a fog environment. It includes a runtime QoS monitoring component, a fog-to-fog (F2F) dynamic service level agreement (SLA) renegotiation component, and a reputation assessment component. A reputation model based on direct graph is proposed to trace a service's reputation value, and a cross-cutting verification mechanism is introduced to verify service performance. The chapter discusses the state-of-the-art solutions toward QoS-aware service choreography, SLA negotiation, and service monitoring. It focuses on the process of delivering the services that have previously deployed on fog nodes by Internet of Things (IoTs) application providers. AdaptFog assumes that a set of resource-intensive fog nodes reside close to the IoT devices to support real-time data processing and low-latency response for mission-critical applications. The chapter provides information on an AdaptFog architecture that enables a reputation mode to facilitate decentralized service composition and underpins a F2F SLA renegotiation.

N2  - Summary As now well established, the world population is aging rapidly and, according to World Health Organization (WHO), the amount of people aged 60 years and older is expected to total 2 billion in 2050. For this reason, an emerging important issue is the definition of a new generation of healthcare platforms capable of monitoring people's quality of life. In this article, we propose a new methodology that supports the entire requirement elicitation process starting from the initial phase of gathering the requirements, both clinical, technological, and end-user, up to the choice of the most suitable solution. Our proposal provides a new new iterative model in the smart healthcare field research area. Furthermore we apply our proposal in a real scenario and we report the end-to-end implementation of the proposed methodology.

N2  - Abstract Previous studies on tourism land use primarily focus on the spatial distribution, and its related impacts on the environment. Here, we propose a future tourism land use simulation model for mountain vacations based on the cellular automata and Markov chain methods, having verified and simulated tourism land use in Emeishan city at a spatial resolution of 30 ? 30 m using remote sensing and GIS. In addition, we introduced a tourism land use intensity index to study the spatial expansion mode of tourism land use. The results have confirmed the validity of the model and demonstrated its ability to simulate future tourism land use. The average growth rate of tourism land use from 2010 to 2015 is 33.36%, and tourism land use will rise from 1.26% of Emeishan city?s land area in 2015 to 2.95% in 2030. Tourism land use shows a spatial expansion pattern along channels from scenic spots to the urban area. The growth of tourism land use in the protected area has an increasing trend when there is no restriction on development, especially in the Eshan region. The simulation results can provide useful implications and guides for regional tourism planning and management.

N2  - Abstract The role of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) in the public sector is relatively new. Prior research on private sector CFOs identified that CFOs tend to focus on either financial or strategic issues. In this study, we examined if these same tendencies exist within the public sector. Using the Department of National Defence as a case study, we asked Comptrollers to compare a set of 8 roles to determine if a bias towards financial or strategic roles exists. We found that some bias exists within National Defence; however, we also found most recognize that you cannot focus exclusively on either role.

N2  - Abstract Human society is experiencing a rapidly changing environment in which energy shortages and an ongoing climate crisis have been identified as two of the major challenges to the sustainable development of human civilization. In the face of these challenges, the concept of a smart city is proposed which aims at achieving sustainable development, increasing the quality of life, and improving the cost-effectiveness of existing and new energy infrastructures. To this end, this study proposes a general framework with a three-tier story chart for guiding the establishment of sustainability assessment models and the selection of their indicators. In addition, a quantitative analysis method is developed for assessing the sustainability of energy infrastructures in a smart city, which indicates how the long-term sustainability of the energy infrastructure can be achieved. The proposed method incorporates extensive environmental, economic, and social indicators, which go beyond conventional facility-level criteria and seamlessly relate to the broader community that benefits from the renewable energy transition (including energy construction, operations, and energy services). The proposed methodologies can be implemented through collecting the corresponding history data of the indicators and following the analysis procedures presented in this study. The proposed methodology can serve as a supporting tool for decision-making on new infrastructure investment and policymaking toward sustainable development. Case studies in Western Sydney were carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed methodologies.

N2  - The main objectives of EFSA's activities on emerging risks are: (i) to carry out activities to identify emerging risks; and (ii) to develop and improve emerging risk identification (ERI) methodologies and approaches and iii) communicate on identified issues and risks. The outcome of these activities also allows EFSA to prepare for future risk assessment challenges.The current technical report summarises the activities of all groups involved in the emerging risk identification procedure, the issues identified in the course of 2019, a description of methodologies being developed and collaborative activities.EFSA networks of knowledge contributing to the emerging risks identification activity include the Emerging Risks Exchange Network, the StakeholderDiscussion Group on Emerging Risks, EFSA's scientific units, scientific panels and the Scientific Committee and its working groups. In total, 17 potential emerging issues were discussed in 2019. Thirteen were concluded to be emerging issues. The potential issues were classified according to the hazard and/or driver identified. A change in consumer behaviour trends as a driver for emerging issues in food safety was identified for more than half of the issues discussed in 2019. A better understanding of these trends is particularly relevant for EFSA to improve preparedness. In addition, in 2019 EREN network members presented and discussed a total of 28 signals/ potential emerging issues identified by their own horizon scanning activities. Different Member states representatives shared their work on signals identification with the objective to collect additional information that can be used for better characterization. More effective methods to collect and share knowledge need to be implemented. Collaboration was a main feature of the 2019 ERI activities. The number of observers increased, a common session between EREN and StaDGER was organized for the first time and collaboration between institutions is a common feature to all methodological development projects.Such collaboration activities require the development of effective digital collaboration tools and a flexible knowledge management system. Communication is a fundamental part of the ERI procedure, in a more ?open knowledge sharing? context it is of increased importance to clearly communicate on the uncertainty associated with the ERI procedure.

N2  - The paper evaluates the levels of smartphone addiction among students using statistical and fuzzy analysis approaches. By using Smartphone Addiction Test (SAT) scores, the data were treated using fuzzy operators, and the relationships were analyzed by applying the statistical techniques. The respondent's addiction level scores were converted into a fuzzy environment through the triangular approach, and demographic characteristics of the respondents were compared to levels of smartphone addiction. The percentage of respondents with mild and moderate levels of addiction to smartphones was found to be high in the study. Gender, age groups, and years of usage were also associated with addiction to smartphones. However, the level of smartphone addiction was not much different based on whether the students are staying with parents or away from their parents. Among the dimensions measuring smartphone addiction, ?lack of control? was ranked first. The dimension, ?excessive use,? was found to be the second-highest influencer of smartphone addiction level. Respondents, to no small extent, were students pursuing undergraduate and graduate programs. Adolescents and other demographic groups can be considered for future studies. Future studies can also focus on using other fuzzy approaches to evaluate the data on smartphone addiction. The study offers prioritized dimensions to be focused on containing the levels of addiction among individuals. Moreover, the ranking of items helps in guiding individuals to look into the problem areas and take the appropriate actions. Measurement of levels of smartphone addiction using a novel hybrid combination of statistical approach and triangular fuzzy approach was carried out in the study. The critical dimensions and items showing the influence on smartphone addiction were ranked.

N2  - Summary In Data Grid systems, quick data access is a challenging issue due to the high latency. The failure of requests is one of the most common matters in these systems that has an impact on performance and access delay. Job scheduling and data replication are two main techniques in reducing access latency. In this paper, we propose two new neighborhood-based job scheduling strategies and a novel neighborhood-based dynamic data replication algorithm (NDDR). The proposed algorithms reduce the access latency by considering a variety of practical parameters for decision making and the access delay by considering the failure probability of a node in job scheduling, replica selection, and replica placement. The proposed neighborhood concept in job scheduling includes all the nodes with low data transmission costs. Therefore, we can select the best computational node and reduce the search time by running a hierarchical and parallel search. NDDR reduces the access latency through selecting the best replica by performing a hierarchical search established based on the access time, storage queue workload, storage speed, and failure probability. NDDR improves the load balancing and data locality by selecting the best replication place considering the workload, temporal locality, geographical locality, and spatial locality. We evaluate our proposed algorithms by using Optorsim Simulator in two scenarios. The simulations confirm that the proposed algorithms improve the results compared with similar existing algorithms by 11%, 15%, 12%, and 10% in terms of mean job time, replication frequency, mean data access latency, and effective network usage, respectively.

N2  - Abstract Monitoring and managing the rapid growth of cities, especially in developing countries, highlights the need for appropriate spatio-temporal models to predict urban growth. The parameters affecting the spatio-temporal analysis of urban growth play a key role in the prediction results. This study proposes an urban growth simulation model by integrating local subjective?objective weights and decision risk values (ORness) into a CA?Markov model. This involves the use of ordered weighting averaging as one of the multicriteria decision analysis methods to combine the weights and degree of risk for generating a variety of risk-averse and/or risk-taking urban growth prediction scenarios. The proposed model has been applied to predict the physical growth of Babol city, located in Mazandaran, Iran. The results indicate that the degrees of ORness = 0.3 and ORness = 0.9 yield better prediction results in the case of using the local and global weighting strategies, respectively. Furthermore, the overall accuracy of local and global weighting strategies at different degrees of risk was 87.6 and 86.8, respectively. This implies that the use of local subjective?objective weights leads to more accurate results than the global weights for simulating urban growth.

N2  - Abstract This qualitative study investigates the structure of the buying centre, the buying process, and the factors that influence buying decisions for perishable-products packaging. This empirical investigation is based on the case study of a major Quebec food retailer. We show that the purchase of packaging changes significantly depending on whether the product is considered more or less strategic for the organization, which determines the required level of packaging customization. Buying centre structure becomes more complex as packaging customization increases. Given the multi-functionality and the interdisciplinarity of packaging, we propose a multi-criteria analysis grid to improve buying decision efficiency and to streamline communication between the various levels of the buying centre.

N2  - Abstract A Raman-based, strain-independent, semi-automated method is presented that allows the rapid (<3 hours) determination of antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from clinical samples. Applying a priori knowledge about the mode of action of the respective antibiotic, we identified characteristic Raman marker bands in the spectrum and calculated batch-wise weighted sum scores from standardized Raman intensity differences between spectra of antibiotic exposed and nonexposed samples of the same strains. The lead substances for three relevant antibiotic classes (fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin, third-generation cephalosporin cefotaxime, ureidopenicillin piperacillin) against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MRGN) revealed a high sensitivity and specificity for the susceptibility testing of two Escherichia coli laboratory strains and 12 clinical isolates. The method benefits from the parallel incubation of control and treated samples, which reduces the variance due to alterations in cultivation conditions and the standardization of differences between batches leading to long-term comparability of Raman measurements.

N2  - A key feature of risk analysis is that risk assessment and risk management should be functionally separated. However, the usefulness of a risk assessment may be limited if the output is not designed to help with risk management decisions. The COMRISK project investigated the communication between risk assessors and risk managers. The overall goal of the project was to identify current practices and challenges in communication between risk assessors and risk managers during the risk analysis process, and thus increase and improve the understanding and the quality of the communication between them. Specific actions to achieve this aim included reviewing of historical food safety cases, analysing risk assessment requests, identifying communication guiding documents, including legislation and agreements, conducting semi-structured interviews with risk assessors and risk managers, and identifying tools for facilitating the communication between risk assessors and risk managers. It was concluded that the usefulness of a risk assessment is strongly dependent on well-defined and mutually recognised risk questions and that scarce or poor communication between risk assessors and risk managers is one of the major reasons when an output from risk assessment fails to support risk management. The communication between risk assessors and risk managers preceding the onset of the risk assessment, when the risk assessment requests with its risk questions are defined, is especially identified as one of the critical points to ensure a risk assessment that is fit for purpose. However, difficulties in understanding were also reported for the communication between risk assessors and risk managers during and after the risk assessment. Lack of communication is seldom a result of formal constraints or agreements nor can it be explained by a wish of the risk assessors or risk managers. Instead, perceived constraints or traditions appear to be possible underlying factors leading to scarce or poor communication between risk assessors and risk managers. It is essential that both risk assessors and risk managers acknowledge the crucial importance of communication between them while at the same time respect their different roles in a risk analysis.According to respondents, the best solution to facilitate the framing of the risk assessment questions isan open dialogue between risk assessors and risk managers to agree on the goal of the assessment and to build trust. Further, the interviewresults indicate that a formal systematic process may facilitate communication during the risk analysis. Where there is uncertainty, e.g due to data gaps or issues related to the methodology and models, it should be acknowledged and described properly by risk assessors to risk managers. Training of risk assessors and risk managers may improve the possibility of a timely and fit-for-purpose output.Such a training should give a deeper insight in the risk management process, give a better understanding of the risk managers role, and especially raise the awareness of the importance of the communication between risk assessors and risk managers.To improve the risk analysis process, it is also important that the risk assessor gets feedback regarding how risk assessments have met the needs of the risk managers.The present study also found that aspects of risk communication studied in this project are not extensively discussed in the guidance documents for risk analysis. More research is needed to identify the barriers for a fit for purpose communication.

N2  - Abstract The value creation wheel (VCW) is the decision-making meta-framework recommended to address innovation, collaboration, and change challenges in formal relationships. The VCW can integrate, complement, or be joined with other frameworks, tools, and theories to address the challenges of formal relationships. The VCW's ability to incorporate intra- and interorganizational insights emerging from internal and external stakeholders is especially useful in solving the challenges of collaborative arrangements. VCW solutions are often more realistic than Design Thinking, Creative Problem-Solving, and Lean because they accommodate the views of various stakeholders about ideas and filters, and because key decision makers must be involved in the main stages of the decision-making process.

N2  - Appraising and improving the quality of teaching is a central issue all over the world. Using the Course Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), the current study examined the relationship between teaching quality dimensions and student satisfaction. The study evaluates the post-graduate students' perception of teaching quality and its relation with overall student satisfaction in context to state public universities of Punjab, India. Data were collected from 348 post-graduate in management students. Confirmatory factor analysis was applied to evaluate the measurement model, and a further Structured Equation Model was applied to test the proposed research hypotheses. The results reveal that clear goals and standards, generic skills, and appropriate assessment have a direct impact on the overall student satisfaction, whereas appropriate workload and good teaching skills have an indirect effect on the overall satisfaction. The female structural model replicated the findings of the overall model and showed that generic skills and clear goals are more important in student satisfaction. In contrast, the male structural model was quite different; only appropriate assessment has a direct impact on student satisfaction. Several implications for the improvement of post-graduate management teaching quality and quality assurance in terms of lecture delivery and course planning in-state public universities of India were further discussed.

N2  - Abstract Mainstream conceptualizations of sustainable development (SD) tend to focus on urban areas or the national or global scale?most recently through the Sustainable Development Goals. This focus often overlooks rural and natural resource-based communities, particularly those dependent on renewable resources like fisheries or forestry. Drawing from a comprehensive review, we propose an alternative approach for interpreting and measuring SD in these contexts. We integrate two seemingly contradictory approaches: sustainability indicators (SIs), whose evolution reflects competing views of the nature of knowledge and action in pursuit of SD, and the use of storytelling in policy and planning, highlighting how actors tell stories to garner support for proposed developments, influence public understanding, and mobilize stakeholders. Examining the opposing epistemologies often underlying these two approaches, we posit that they can be brought together through a transdisciplinary lens for sustainable rural development. We illustrate these potentials in Newfoundland and Labrador, a highly resource-based region in which rural communities are often characterized by deficiencies based narratives. In such contexts, storytelling can allow rural stakeholders to interpret SD while potentially enlisting SIs in telling their own sustainability stories.

N2  - In this study, we review POM-based research related to prevention of terrorism. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) terrorist attacks have the potential to be prevented. Consequently, the focus of this study is on security enhancement and improving the resiliency of a nation to prevent terrorist attacks. Accordingly, we review articles from the 25 top journals, [following procedures developed by Gupta et al. (2016)], in the fields of Production and Operations Management, Operations Research, Management Science, and Supply Chain Management. In addition, we searched some selected journals in the fields of Information Sciences, Political Science, and Economics. This literature is organized and reviewed under the following seven core capabilities defined by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS): (1) Intelligence and Information Sharing, (2) Planning, (3) Interdiction and Disruption, (4) Screening, Search, and Detection, (5) Forensics and Attribution, (6) Public Information and Warning, and (7) Operational Coordination. We found that POM research on terrorism is primarily driven by the type of information that a defending country and a terrorist have about each other. Game theory is the main technique that is used in most research papers. Possible directions for future research are discussed.

N2  - Abstract Background The lack of a value set allowing the calculation of QALY is an important limitation when establishing the value of emerging therapies to treat food allergy. The aim of this study was to develop a Short-Form Six-Dimension version 2 (SF-6Dv2) preference value set for the calculation of health utility from the Canadian food-allergic population. Methods Two hundred ninety-five parents of patients aged 0-17 years old and 154 patients aged 12 years old and above with food allergy were recruited in clinic and online. Participants were asked to complete a self-administered online questionnaire including generic health-related quality of life questionnaires. Various health states described by the SF-6Dv2 were valued with time-trade-off and discrete choice experiments. Data from elicitation techniques were combined using the hybrid regression model. Results A total of 241 parents and 125 patients performed 3904 time-trade-off and 5112 discrete choice experiments. Utility decrements were estimated for each level of each SF-6Dv2 dimension. Utility values calculated based on the validated preference set were in average 0.15 lower (95%CI: 0.12-0.18) and were poorly correlated (R2 = 0.46) with those derived from the EQ-5D-5L generic questionnaire in the same cohort. Conclusion A representative preference value set for patients with food allergy was determined using the SF-6Dv2 generic questionnaire. This adapted preference set will contribute to improve the validity of future utility estimates in this population for the appraisal of upcoming potentially impactful but sometimes costly therapies.

N2  - Summary The waste heat management of the data center cooling systems has a significant share in the energy-efficient operations of the data centers. In this study, a new hybrid desalination-data center cooling system is proposed to reduce the cost drawback of the waste heat in the data center cooling operations. A two-phase liquid-immersion cooling unit is selected as the data center cooling method with the cooling load range of 0.7 to 1.5 kW. It is a promising solution thanks to the high heat flux removal performance but there is still a lack of research about waste heat management. The waste heat of the immersion cooling system is used to heat up the feed side of the desalination module. A direct contact membrane distillation system as preferred as the desalination module with the membrane area range of 5 to 75 cm2. The proposed hybrid system is investigated according to the thermodynamic, economic, and thermoeconomic aspects. The thermoeconomic assessment is done concerning the unique exergy-cost matrix of the original design. The maximum thermal and exergy efficiencies are found as 64.5% and 53.7%, respectively. The daily distilled water rate can reach 6.13?kg at the highest cooling load and membrane area. Compared to the stand-alone data center cooling operation, the hybrid system has higher capital and operation costs. The payback period is found 3.72?years that means the proposed system is economically feasible for real applications. Also, the levelized product cost of the hybrid design is calculated in the range of 2.69 to 5.33 SGD/h. In the multiobjective optimization study, the best trade-off point is decided at the cooling load of 1.1 kW whilst the membrane area varies between 5.12 and 5.19 cm2.

N2  - Abstract Scenario planning has become detached from its roots in strategic management. The dominance of strategy process research and the search for links to performance and impact have pushed researchers away from strategy perspectives. While the cognitive stream of research has provided many insights, a practice approach is presented as an alternative theoretical perspective that reestablishes the role of strategy in a scenario planning process. Within a strategy-as-practice perspective, three areas of significance to practice-orientated scenario planning research emerge: situated practice, macro influences, and micro activities. Scholarly attention to these areas can enhance current theoretical and practical understanding of scenario planning.

N2  - Abstract With increasing societal demands for food security and environmental sustainability on land, the question arises: to what extent do synergies and trade-offs exist between soil functions and how can they be measured across Europe? To address this challenge, we followed the functional land management approach and assessed five soil functions: primary productivity, water regulation and purification, climate regulation, soil biodiversity and nutrient cycling. Soil, management and climate data were collected from 94 sites covering 13 countries, five climatic zones and two land-use types (arable and grassland). This dataset was analysed using the Soil Navigator, a multicriteria decision support system developed to assess the supply of the five soil functions simultaneously. Most sites scored high for two to three soil functions, demonstrating that managing for multifunctionality in soil is possible but that local constraints and trade-offs do exist. Nutrient cycling, biodiversity and climate regulation were less frequently delivered at high capacity than the other two soil functions. Using correlation and co-occurrence analyses, we also found that synergies and trade-offs between soil functions vary among climatic zones and land-use types. This study provides a new framework for monitoring soil quality at the European scale where both the supply of soil functions and their interactions are considered. Highlights Managing and monitoring soil multifunctionality across Europe is possible. Synergies and trade-offs between soil functions exist, making it difficult to maximize the supply of all five soil functions simultaneously. Synergies and trade-offs between soil functions vary by climatic zone and land-use type. Climate regulation, biodiversity and nutrient cycling are less frequently delivered at high capacity.

N2  - Abstract The partitioned Bonferroni mean (PBM) operator, which was oriented as an elementary attempt to outstretch the Bonferroni mean (BM) operator, has enlarged the class of BM-type aggregation operators for information accumulation by modeling interrelationship among pairwise disjoint partition sets with the presupposition that the criteria of intra-partition are homogeneously related to each other, while no relationship exists among criteria of inter-partition. Although PBM has encountered a lot of attraction from the researchers due to its versatility in information aggregation technique, the principal disadvantage of the existing PBM definitions evolution is that they do not provide any specification regarding the relationship among criteria of partition structure during design, development, and applications of PBM over unalike situations of information fusion. This consideration propels us to focus on the systematic investigation of different variations of PBM operators based on various mandatory requisites to be imposed on information retrieved from the partition sets. In this regard, we propose the construction of novel generalized partitioned Bonferroni mean (GPBM) operator by befitting its suitable components to provide a descriptive configuration, which is quite interpretable, understandable and thus facilitates the ability to model specific mandatory prerequisites in a single operator. To enrich the capacity for modeling real-life decision situations, the PBM operator is customized to propose optional partitioned Bonferroni mean (OPBM) operator that captures partition-wise interrelationship among attributes while taking into consideration optional conditions jumbled in each partition set. Furthermore, we demonstrate the construction methodology of generalized OPBM operator that amalgamate the concept of GPBM and OPBM operator to enhance and model-specific requirements along with optional requirements as per the desires of decision makers.

The transition to the circular economy creates value through closed-loop systems, reverse logistics, eco-design, product life cycle management, and clean production. The aim of the study was to propose a holistic conceptual framework for barriers of circular supply chain for sustainability in the textile industry. Within this aim, an in-depth literature review on barriers was conducted by covering all supply chain stages and circular initiatives in textile industry. Then, a focus group study was implemented. In the focus group study, barriers related to supply chains that prevent companies to implement the circular economy were discussed and validated. As a result, a total of 25 barriers were classified under nine main categories such as (a) management and decision-making, (b) labour, (c) design challenges, (d) materials, (e) rules and regulations, (f) lack of knowledge and awareness, (g) lack of integration and collaboration, (h) cost, and (i) technical infrastructure.

N2  - Abstract This investigation attempts to understand the eco-hydrology of, and accordingly suggest an option to manage floodwater for agriculture in, the understudied and data-sparse ephemeral Baraka River Basin within the hyper-arid region of Sudan. Reference is made to the major feature of the basin, that is, the Toker Delta spate irrigation scheme. A point-to-pixel comparison of gridded and ground-based data sets is performed to enhance the estimates of rainfall. Analysis of remotely sensed land use/cover data is performed. The results show a significant reduction of the grassland and barren areas explained by a significant expansion of the cropland and open shrubland (invasive mesquite trees) areas in the delta. The cotton sown area is highly dependent on the flooded area and the discharge volume in the delta. However, the area of this major crop has declined since the early 1990s in favour of cultivation of more profitable food crops. Expansion of mesquite in the delta is problematic, taking hold under increased floodwater, and can only be manged by clearance to provide crop cultivation area. There is a great potential for floodwater harvesting during the rainfall season (June to September). A total seasonal runoff volume of around 4.6 and 10.8 billion cubic metres is estimated at 90 and 50% probabilities of exceedance (reliabilities), respectively. Rather than leaving the runoff generated from rainfall events to pass to the Red Sea or be consumed by mesquite trees, a location for runoff harvesting structure in a highly suitable area is proposed. Such a structure will support any policy shifts towards planning and managing the basin water resources for use in irrigating the agricultural scheme.

N2  - Summary This chapter provides an overview of two case studies that examine stakeholder reactions toward iodine biofortification in Uganda. The first case applies the protection motivation theory and evaluates the intention of school heads and parents of school-aged children to include iodine-biofortified legumes in school feeding programs. The second case study takes a broader scope of stakeholder groups and applies the analytical hierarchy process, a multicriteria decision-making tool, to understand the stakeholders' evaluation of the relative importance of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) factors in implementing agronomic iodine biofortification in Uganda. Results from the two cases demonstrate that stakeholders are generally optimistic about the iodine biofortification strategy to improve iodine intake and address the prevalent iodine deficiency disorders. Both cases provide insights into key factors that need to be considered in implementing iodine biofortification technology in a developing country.
