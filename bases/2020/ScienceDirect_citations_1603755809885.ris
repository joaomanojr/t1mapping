AB  - Road dust is a key repository for PAHs and transformed PAH products (TPPs) generated from natural and anthropogenic sources in the urban environment. Eventhough PAHs and TPPs are prone to post-emission photochemical processes, very limited studies exist on the subject for road dust. This knowledge gap is of particular concern since some of the resultant TPPs are notably more carcinogenic than their precursor PAHs. This study evaluated the role of 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) photons on the photochemistry of PAHs and TPPs in road dust. The findings show that UV irradiation had varying effects on the fate of analytes, particularly naphthalene (NAP), phenanthrene (PHE), 7, 12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), 1-hydroxypyrene (HPY), 1-nitropyrene (1NPY), pyrene (PYR) and 5-nitroacenaphthene (5NAC). Photochemical relationship was identified between PYR, 1NPY and HPY, and DMBA and benzo(a)anthracene. Unlike carbonyl-PAHs, parent PAHs, nitro-PAHs and hydroxy-PAHs can originate from photolysis. Photon irradiation durations of 3, 6 and 7.5 h had the most intense influence on the photolytic process with 7.5 h as optimum. The photochemical rate at optimum irradiation duration shows an increasing trend of NAP < PHE < 1NPY < DMBA < 5NAC < HPY with respective estimates of 0.08, 0.11, 0.21, 0.22, 0.43, and 0.59 mg kg−1 hr−1. Physicochemical properties of analytes such as index of refraction and vapour pressure (in logarithmic form) had an inverse effect on photolysis. The knowledge generated is significant for the in-depth understanding of the fate of PAHs and TPPs on urban road surfaces and contributes to the greater protection of human health and the environment.

AB  - Similarity measure confirms the proximity of two objects to each other. This concept can be applied as fuzzy or intuitionistic fuzzy. There are lots of fuzzy similarity measures which had been extended to intuitionistic fuzzy similarity measure, with application in different domain. There is need to investigate these methods based on their application for further modification. Thus, the aim of this research is to modify existing fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy similarity measures, and apply it to cognitive domain for better performance. Existing intuitionistic fuzzy similarity methods were extended and modified. These research showed that the existing methods had been applied to various domains, and researchers had improved and extended most fuzzy similarity measure to intuitionistic fuzzy similarity measure for optimal performance. Experiment showed that the proposed methods gives higher similarity value and lower processing time.

AB  - Higher Education is in the centre of interest in this era of Outcome Based Education (OBE) in learning centric environment due to in quest of better human life and living and further improvement in technological aspects. The main challenges remain in providing resource persons in quest of optimum knowledge transfer to address quality concern right from career opportunities to continuing education programs. So opening up new academic departments to address the societal needs is a regular process in parallel to resource enhancement in the existing departments, keeping balance with the increasing number of students. In this problem, there are inherent uncertainties in terms of resignation and retention of the resource persons due to their own interest. That’s the reason why most of the teaching organizations encounter the difficulties of resource allocation of teaching personnel in the academic departments. The objective of this proposed work is to demonstrate how the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied in goal programming (GP) formulation of the problem for university resource planning of academic personnel to different departments for enhancement of academic standards of a university on a long-term basis in the planning process. In model formulation, the number of Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor, Visiting/Part-Time faculty member and Non-teaching staff along with the budget goals of each of the academic departments are identified and described. In the solution process, the ideais to employ GA to the goal programming (GP) construction of academic resource planning problems with fractional goals and target intervals in university management system.

AB  - This paper proposes a Multicriteria Approach for the Incremental Periodic Prediction (MAI2P). This approach is periodically applied while considering the sequential evolution of the dynamic information system under the variation of the set of actions in an ever-evolving learning sample. It is based on the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA) and consists of three phases. The first aims at constructing a decision table and is based on three steps: (1) constructing a representative learning sample of “Actions of reference”, (2) constructing a coherent criteria family for the actions’ characterization and (3) building a decision table. The second consists in an incremental updating of the DRSA approximations in order to infer a preference model resulting in a set of decision rules. The third consists of classifying the potential actions in one of the predefined decision classes. The first two phases run at the end of the current period and the third phase runs at the beginning of the next period. The approach MAI2P has been applied in the context of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). It has been validated on a French MOOC proposed by a Business School in France. Experiments showed that the pessimistic cumulative approach gives the most efficient preference model with an F-measure and an accuracy values reaching 0.66 and 0.89 respectively.

AB  - Supply chain gap analysis is a practical method for quantitatively measuring the gap between the current state and a desired/ideal state in a supply chain, and generating a list of corrective actions to eliminate this gap and reach a desired/ideal level in supply chain goals. We propose a novel multi-objective co-evolutionary approach for supply chain gap analysis by hybridizing two well-known algorithms of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) and multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). The proposed algorithm considers the best solution of NSGAII at each iteration and uses it as the initial population in MOPSO. We consider three objective functions, including the expected costs, the total time, and customer satisfaction. The house of quality and quality function deployment is used to transform customer requirements into product characteristics. We also use a response surface methodology with multi-objective decision making for tuning the parameters since metaheuristic methods are generally sensitive to input parameters. We finally generate several random problems with different scenarios to compare the performance of our hybrid approach with singular methods. Five performance measures (i.e., mean ideal distance, diversification metric, quality metric, data envelopment analysis, and hypervolume metric) are used for this comparison. The results show the hybrid approach proposed in this study outperforms singular NSGAII and MOPSO metaheuristics in most scenarios.

AB  - Small-scale Distributed Generation through photovoltaic technology is promising, driven by government policies and lower component prices. However, the large amount to be invested, the characteristics of photovoltaic energy, and the uncertainties regarding this technology make it difficult to secure the investment decision and to visualize the success potentiality. Our objective is to propose a success measurement model for the small-scale distributed generation projects' implementation of photovoltaic energy. The methodological approach to modeling encompasses the concepts of Key Performance Indicators and Multicriteria Decision Analysis based on Analytic Hierarchy Process. We researched with 19 experts (researchers) and 32 investors in photovoltaic energy. The model made it possible to weigh the indicators and measure the projects' success under evaluation. Of the projects diagnosed, 15 achieved a Global Success Index of over 76%, considered “Full Success” and 17 were judged as “Potential Success”. We identified that improvement in some Key Performance Indicators could advance to “Full Success” level projects framed as “Potential Success”. Thus, the model contributes to reflection and learning, given our indicators analysis. The main contribution we highlight is the measurement approach developed for the model serving to generate new measurement models. Such models may incorporate other themes, contextual factors, and considerations different from those performed in this case. Applying this model to future projects can provide consistent decisions or make robust new small-scale photovoltaic projects.

AB  - Recent studies on modular and distributed manufacturing have introduced a new angle to the traditional economies of scale that claim that large plants exhibit better efficiencies and lower costs. A modular design has several advantages, including higher flexibility of decisions, lower investment costs, shorter time-to-market, and adaptability to market conditions. While design flexibility is a widely studied concept in the process design, modular design provides an interesting new opportunity to the design optimization problem under demand variability. In this work, a framework for modular design under demand variability is proposed. The framework consists of two steps. First, the feasible region for each module is represented analytically with the help of the historical data or the data from a simulation using a classification technique. In the second step, the optimal design choice is obtained by integrating the classifier models built in the first step as constraints in the design optimization problem. The design optimization problem is first solved considering a single objective, i.e., minimizing the total cost or maximizing the flexibility. These two objectives are then addressed simultaneously using a multiobjective optimization framework that considers the tradeoff between maximizing the flexibility of design and minimizing the cost. Computational studies conducted using a case study of an air separation plant, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Several advantages of using a modular design, as well as data-driven methods in the decision-making process in the design step, are discussed.

AB  - Land is a pricy and scarce resource, particularly in urban areas. If it is utilized effectively, suitable sites can be allocated for urban wastewater safe disposal through effluents treatment and reuse. This study used multicriteria decision-making approach known as weighted linear combination to map the suitability of an on-site natural wastewater treatment system in the urban and industrial environments—selecting Faisalabad City in Pakistan as the study area. Location of the study region in a water-scarce zone increases the scope of the untreated wastewater disposal into land and water bodies as well as its reuse for irrigation. Data on climate parameters (i.e., temperature, rainfall, and evapotranspiration), geophysical parameters, (i.e., including soil, topography, depth to groundwater table, and groundwater electrical conductivity), and socioeconomic parameters (i.e., land cover maps and proximity from roads/railways and rivers/canals) are used for the development of weighted linear combination based suitability index maps. Analytical hierarchical process-based heuristic approach is adapted to estimate the relative importance of all the parameters. Weights with less than 0.10 consistency ratio are used in the preparation of the final suitability map. The land area required for the proposed on-site wastewater treatment system is estimated as a function of climatic factors and wastewater characteristics. Adoption of the proposed multicriteria framework helped identifying four potentially environment-friendly and economically viable sites. The results show that geospatial multicriteria framework could efficiently help urban planners in sustainable wastewater management, particularly in developing countries where climate-change-induced water scarcity and associated health issues are critical.

Joining is a key manufacturing process and historically was a paper-based process with incomplete variety documentation. Nowadays, digital joining element design is a substitution of paper for 3D space. Nonetheless, it remains an ambiguous manual task with limited automation, resulting in time-consuming iterative error-prone development trajectories and costly reworks. This contribution addresses the state of the art in joining element design in both research and industry practice. It reviews product variety and its impact on joining processes. The paper identifies a need for integrating product variety into joining element design and it proposes a solution pathway using artificial intelligence methods.

AB  - Software-defined network (SDN) separates the network control plane from the data forwarding plane. SDN has shown significant benefits in many ways compared to conventional non-SDN networks. However, traffic distribution in SDN impacts efficiency and raises many other challenges. For instance, uneven load distribution in the SDN significantly impacts the network performance. Hence, several SDN load balancing (LB) techniques have been introduced to improve the efficiency of SDN. In this article, we provide a thematic taxonomy of LB in SDN, considering several parameters from the past technical studies such as the objectives of LB, data plane LB techniques, control plane LB techniques, other aspects of data plane/control plane LB as well as the performance metrics for LB techniques. Furthermore, useful insights on LB and a comparative analysis of various promising SDN LB techniques are also included in the survey. Finally, existing challenges and future direction on SDN LB techniques are highlighted.

AB  - Precision medicine is a dynamic area embracing a diverse and increasing type of approaches that allow the targeting of new medicines, screening programs or preventive healthcare strategies, which include the use of biologic markers or complex tests driven by algorithms also potentially taking account of patient preferences. The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcome Research expanded its current work around precision medicine to (1) describe the evolving paradigm of precision medicine with examples of current and evolving applications, (2) describe key stakeholders perspectives on the value of precision medicine in their respective domains, and (3) define the core factors that should be considered in a value assessment framework for precision medicine. With the ultimate goal of improving health of well-defined patient groups, precision medicine will affect all stakeholders in the healthcare system at multiple levels spanning the individual perspective to the societal perspective. For an efficient, timely and practical precision medicine value assessment framework, it will be important to address these multiple perspectives through building consensus among the stakeholders for robust procedures and measures of value aspects, including performance of precision mechanism; aligned reimbursement processes of precision mechanism and subsequent treatment; transparent expectations for evidence requirements and study designs adequately matched to the intended use of the precision mechanism and to the smaller target patient populations; recognizing the potential range of value-generation such as ruling-in and ruling-out decisions.

AB  - Soil is a dynamic system that serves a wide range of functions supporting human activities and ecosystems. The extent of heavy metal soil contamination worldwide is evident. Phytoremediation is a strategy that takes advantage of natural metabolic and transport processes of plants for soil remediation. As a green alternative to traditional remediation technologies, phytoremediation offers particular advantages when applied to contaminated soils spanning large areas. A phytoremediation value chain concept is presented in this chapter, where six echelons across the value chains have been be identified; phytoremediation and metal removal, biomass cultivation and supply, refinery for bioproducts, storage, distribution, and demand. Despite empirical effort to combine phytoremediation with the biorefinery concept and cropping system planning for hyperaccumulator species and metal removal, the value chain of phytoremediation remains an open challenge. Notably, phytoremediation value chains are complicated by their interconnection with soil metal contamination and other environmental variables as well as multiechelon complexity. This chapter discusses phytoremediation value chain characteristics and design challenges, covering an overview of phytoremediation processes and mechanisms, and empirical research in soil metal remediation by terrestrial plant species. A critical review of the state-of-the-art modeling highlights emerging research gaps and identified future research frontiers to unlock the complexity of phytoremediation value chains. This chapter is concluded with a proposed phytoremediation systems modeling framework, which is underpinned by process systems engineering approaches to inform the multicriteria multiechelon decision-making on phytoremediation-biorefinery value chains.

AB  - Recent studies in project management have shown the important role of entrepreneurship orientation of the individuals in project performance. Although identifying the role of entrepreneurship orientation as a critical success factor in project performance has been considered as an important issue, it is also important to develop a measurement system for predicting performance based on the degree of an individual's entrepreneurial orientation. In this study, we use predictive analytics by proposing a machine learning approach to predict individuals' project performance based on measures of several aspects of entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial attitude of the individuals. We investigated this relationship using a sample of 185 observations and a range of machine learning algorithms including lasso, ridge, support vector machines, neural networks, and random forest. Our results showed that the best method for predicting project performance is lasso. After identifying the best predictive model, we then used the Bayesian Information Criterion and the Akaike Information Criterion to identify the most significant factors. Our results identify all three aspects of entrepreneurial attitude (social self-efficacy, appearance self-efficacy, and comparativeness) and one aspect of entrepreneurial orientation (proactiveness) as the most important factors. This study contributes to the relationship between entrepreneurship skills and project performance and provides insights into the application of emerging tools in data science and machine learning in operations management and project management research.

AB  - The widespread popularity and spread of ontologies in many areas increasingly requires the successful integration of multiple such ontologies. The ontology integration problem has been investigated during last years and it is still a challenging task. Aligning and merging existing ontologies, which are usually handled manually, is often a big and tedious part of the sharing process. Due to the fact that there are different approaches, tools and strategies that help to avoid mistakes during modeling especially large domains and creating a new single coherent ontology, this article attempts to build a common knowledge repository in the form of an open and publicly available tool. The overall goal of the proposed open knowledge repository is to provide free access to basic data and to compare the features offered. It is worth mentioning that this form of knowledge representation is publicly available and focuses on the possibility of updating and reusing. It is an attempt to structure knowledge that can be successfully extended with additional groups of solutions and parameters. The proposed approach can be easily implemented as a light library and used in any type of OWL/RDF or OWL/XML management application or adapted in a given management information system.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance has become one of the most important health problems and global action plans have been proposed globally. Prevention plays a key role in these actions plan and, in this context, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Time Series Forecasting techniques, for predicting future outbreaks of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Infection incidence forecasting is approached as a Feature Selection based Time Series Forecasting problem using multivariate time series composed of incidence of Staphylococcus aureus Methicillin-sensible and MRSA infections, influenza incidence and total days of therapy of both of Levofloxacin and Oseltamivir antimicrobials. Data were collected from the University Hospital of Getafe (Spain) from January 2009 to January 2018, using months as time granularity. The main contributions of the work are the following: the applications of wrapper feature selection methods where the search strategy is based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) along with evaluators based on the most powerful state-of-the-art regression algorithms. The performance of the feature selection methods has been measured using the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) performance metrics. A novel multi-criteria decision-making process is proposed in order to select the most satisfactory forecasting model, using the metrics previously mentioned, as well as the slopes of model prediction lines in the 1, 2 and 3 steps-ahead predictions. The multi-criteria decision-making process is applied to the best models resulting from a ranking of databases and regression algorithms obtained through multiple statistical tests. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a feature selection based multivariate time series methodology is proposed for antibiotic resistance forecasting. Final results show that the best model according to the proposed multi-criteria decision making process provides a RMSE = (0.1349, 0.1304, 0.1325) and a MAE = (0.1003, 0.096, 0.0987) for 1, 2, and 3 steps-ahead predictions.

AB  - Multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods have been utilised to solve discrete problems in broad domains. Existing MCDM methods have been developed on the basis of two main contexts, namely, human and mathematical approaches. Each approach faces different challenges, such as inconsistency, time consumption in a pairwise comparison, unnatural comparison, vagueness, normalisation, distance measurement and the issue of criteria weighting in mathematical approach. To solve these challenges, this work presents fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM), which is a novel MCDM method under fuzzy environment. FDOSM consists of three stages, namely, data input, data transformation and data processing units. Two decision-making platforms, namely, single and group decision-making contexts, are performed on FDOSM. Two case studies (i.e. communication and sport) with multicriteria decision problems are applied to illustrate the significance of FDOSM. The behaviour of FDOSM works on the idea of ideal solutions and allows experts to select the best value and compare the best and other values under the same criterion. Subsequently, mathematical operations are performed to reach a final rank and select the best alternative from a set of available alternatives. In conclusion, FDOSM is debated on and compared with different MCDM methods from ranking and weighting perspectives. Results of FDOSM are more logical than those of other existing MCDM methods.

AB  - Forests are important dynamic systems which are widely affected by fire worldwide. Due to the complexity and non-linearity of the forest fire problem, employing hybrid evolutionary algorithms is a logical task to achieve a reliable approximation of this environmental threat. Three fuzzy-metaheuristic ensembles, based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) incorporated with genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE) evolutionary algorithms are used to produce the forest fire susceptibility map (FFSM) of a fire-prone region in Iran. A sensitivity analysis is also executed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ensembles in terms of time and complexity. The results revealed that all models produce FFSMs with acceptable accuracy. However, the superiority of the GA-ANFIS was shown in both recognizing the pattern (AUROCtrain = 0.912 and Error = 0.1277) and predicting unseen fire events (AUROCtest = 0.850 and Error = 0.1638). The optimized structures of the proposed GA-ANFIS and PSO-ANFIS ensembles could be good alternatives to traditional forest fire predictive models, and their FFSMs can be promisingly used for future planning and decision making in the proposed area.

In the past two decades, DM theories and techniques continue to be incorporated into and contribute to the development of SS applications. Maintaining the pace of the rapid transitions in this field, this paper systematically reviews the relevant articles published between 2013 and 2018. Articles that orient various DM techniques are selected and analyzed under a well-established framework. State-of-the-art developments in the adoption of DM techniques are summarized in a SS process. We pay particular attention to promising directions that can dominate future research in this field. This paper further extends the history of several interacting fields, including big data and economic theories, toward methodological rather than application dimensions. The potential of such fields for SS is discussed from an interdisciplinary perspective.

Drawing on a rich data set obtained from selected case study firms in Pakistan, three MCDM tools, namely, intuitionistic fuzzy decision-making trial and evolution laboratory (IF-DEMATEL), analytic network process (ANP), and simple additive weighting (SAW), are employed to assess the relative importance of BDA capabilities and the relationship of these capabilities with the firm performance. The results show that BDA capabilities are interdependent, and infrastructure capabilities are the highest-ranked among all, followed by management and human resource capabilities, respectively. The SAW results indicate an association between BDA capabilities and firm performance. Moreover, BDA capabilities are more strongly related to operational performance than to market performance.

First, a DT-driven PDE framework, which integrates various stages of product life cycle between virtual and physical spaces, is proposed. In the PDE framework, three complex networks are established: mapping network, prediction network, and feedback network. In order to embed the complex networks accurately in the framework, the PDE algorithms based on artificial neural network are introduced. Finally, a cased study of roll granulator design evaluation is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed PDE method.

AB  - As the number of technologies implemented in our daily life and rapidly deployed in the transportation system continuously increases, the car-following model is crucial in the transition towards developing an intelligent transportation system. The car-following model adopts different types of sensors to collect driver behaviour for developing road safety and efficient traffic management. This systematic literature review aims to examine previous research to highlight several insights into a number of issues, problems and challenges encountered in research over the last 11 years. Three major databases (i.e. IEEE Xplore®, ScienceDirect and Web of Science) are scanned and surveyed to locate highly cited peer-reviewed studies. Amongst the 714 articles found, only 126 are analysed to map the car-following model research area. Two phases of articles filtration process are implemented on collected articles. The first phase is performed using inclusion criteria like development articles written in English language and development/review articles discussed the integration of car-following model applications in the process of driver behaviour characterisation. Then, the resulted articles from the first phase are included in the second phase for further filtration. The second phase of filtration is achieved using more specific inclusion criteria, i.e. the articles that discuss data acquisition system (DAS) and the integration of car-following model in driver behaviour characterisation. The final set of articles is categorised in three main categories: review articles (5/126), learning-based development articles (16/126) and non-learning-based development articles (105/126). The taxonomy of grouping development studies is created in accordance with the type of dataset used for development. A number of motivational topics have been reported to pursue research development in this area. Recommendations for different stakeholders regarding several valuable points are provided to facilitate and accelerate development in the car-following context. Substantial analysis is performed to identify research gaps in the experimental methodologies applied in the literature. This analysis is conducted on the basis of the methodological aspects of data collection to identify the weaknesses of the current literature. A research map is drawn to provide several insights into potential key points towards the advancement of this research area.

This is due to the diversity of operational and local parameters, as well as the multitude of stakeholders involved, who generally have conflicting interests. This sets up a challenging multi-criteria decision problem on the activities to be carried out during the decommissioning process. This paper aims to present an overview of decision-support tools applied to decommissioning, and covers many economic sectors, with a focus on the oil and gas sector and on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods. The paper delves deep into the aspects to be considered before reaching a decision, examining the experiences and methods found both in industrial reports and in academic papers.

AB  - The development, modification and optimization of analytical methods capable of simultaneous extraction and in-cell clean-up of extracts for subsequent determination of parent PAHs and their associated transformed nitro-PAHs (NPAH), carbonyl-PAHs (CPAH) and hydroxy-PAHs (HO-PAH) products (TPPs) is essential for reducing the time and cost of analysis. The aim of this study was to modify and optimize the pressurized fluid extraction (PFE) technique capable of simultaneous extraction and in-cell clean-up of PAHs and TPPs in urban dust standard reference material and road dust for GC-MS analyses. In this study, multivariate data analysis such as factor analysis (FA), and preference ranking organisation method for enrichment evaluation (PROMETHEE) and geometrical analysis for interactive aid (GAIA) were used to assess the performance of the methods. As the key outcome of the study, an optimized selective reaction monitoring (SRM) Triple Quadrupole (TQ) electron ionization (EI)-GC/MS for measuring PAHs and TPPs without derivatization of polar HO-PAHs was developed. The limits of detection (LOD) for parent PAHs, CPAHs, NPAHs and HO-PAHs using Shimadzu TQ were 1.0–5.0 pg, 1.0–5.0 pg, 1.0–50.0 pg, and 1.0–25.0 pg, respectively. The PROMETHEE-GAIA analysis of the results showed that a combination of 3% deactivated silica gel and activated alumina (2:1) as in-cell clean-up material, and sequential PFE extraction (200 °C ASE temperature, 9 min preheat time and 3 times extraction cycle) using 100% hexane followed by hexane/DCM (1:1) is the best condition for analytes extraction from road dust. An optimized, fast and reliable GC/MS method operated solely in electron ionization (EI) mode was developed for measuring all analytes. The outcomes of this study will contribute significantly to future research on PAHs and TPPs, thereby promoting a safe and sustainable environment.

KW  - Commissioning strategy
AB  - Commissioning is an effective means to reduce the energy consumption of cooling systems in buildings. However, owing to the uncertainty of the load, the deviation between the true value of the load and the predicted value may cause a mismatch between the cooling load and the cooling capacity of the commissioning strategy, resulting in low robustness of the commissioning strategy. Therefore, a low-cost cooling system commissioning strategy, which can effectively quantify the load uncertainty and ensure the robustness of the strategy, is proposed in this study. A Quantile Regression Neural Network (QRNN) model is established to obtain the uncertainty range of the cooling load of a building in the form of a probability distribution. The low-cost commissioning method under each working condition with different partial load rates is obtained using an optimisation algorithm. An entropy–weight Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) multicriteria decision-making method is applied to optimise the commissioning strategy for the highest guarantee rate and lowest energy consumption. Through the case study of an existing office building located in Inner Mongolia, northern China, it was concluded that the proposed commissioning strategy can reduce the building’s average daily energy consumption by 7.75%. The results indicate that compared with the deterministic commissioning strategy, this robust commissioning strategy can achieve a higher guarantee rate under various load demands. In particular, on days with high load demand, a high guaranteed rate and low energy consumption can be achieved simultaneously.

AB  - Short text sentiment analysis is challenging because short texts are limited in length and lack context. Short texts are usually rather ambiguous because of polysemy and the typos these texts contain. Polysemy is the coexistence of multiple word meanings and commonly appears in every language. Various uses of a word may assign the word both positive and negative meanings. In previous studies, the variability of words is often ignored, which may cause analysis errors. In this study, to resolve this problem, we proposed a novel text representation model named Word2PLTS for short text sentiment analysis by introducing probabilistic linguistic terms sets (PLTSs) and the relevant theory. In this model, every word is represented as a PLTS that fully describes the possibilities for the sentiment polarity of the word. Then, by using support vector machines (SVM), a novel sentiment analysis and polarity classification framework named SACPC is obtained. This framework is a technique that combines supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We compare SAPCP to lexicon-based approaches and machine learning approaches on three benchmark datasets. A noticeable improvement in performance is achieved. To further verify the superiority of SAPCP, state of the art performance comparisons are conducted, and the results are impressive.

AB  - Recent advances in the industrial Internet of Things and smart data analytics have empowered companies to shift towards an open manufacturing paradigm to crowdsource and share manufacturing resources based on demand and capacities across the value chain. Reconfigurable process planning (RPP) reconstructs the optimal process planning for each batch according to different part batches based on commonality. In combination with the optimal crowdsourcing contracting (OCC) strategy, RPP helps release fixed capital and increase the flexibility of the enterprise under the requirement of diversified parts. The coupling of process planning and crowdsourcing contracting decisions is inherent in open manufacturing. This paper focuses on coordinated optimization underlying OCC with RPP. An OCC decision-making mechanism considering RPP based on Stackelberg game theory is established, which provides a solution for trade-offs between the RPP decision-maker and the OCC decision-maker. A coordinated optimization model is proposed to reveal the hierarchical relationships and is solved by a nesting genetic algorithm. A case study of a group of rotating shaft parts is taken to illustrate the effectiveness of the bilevel coordinated optimization (BCO) model. The results present that the commonality has an apparent impact on the OCC and RPP decisions in open manufacturing, and integrating it into process planning activities is advisable for platform enterprises to increase production efficiency and competitive advantages. Our proposed model can deal with the conflict and coordination between OCC and RPP and balances the benefits of platform enterprise with the optimal contractor impacts triggered by planning activities.

AB  - Eurosystem macroprudential policies require shared action between national authorities and the European Central Bank (ECB). This has created the need for a common basis for macroprudential analysis and as result the Macroprudential Database (MPDB) was created by the ECB and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) in 2015 in order to support the central bank's functions and ESRB's needs. This paper examines a multivariate binary logit Early Warning Model (EWM) for systemic banking crises with the aim to evaluate the predictive validity of the risk indicators included in the MPDB, as well as further variables not employed in previous relevant studies. The main finding is that most of the risk indicators employed from MPDB are important for forecasting from 4 to 1 years before the onset of a systemic banking crisis. Specific banking variables that capture industry concentration, assets, funding, and liquidity, are more important, on average, than macroeconomic variables. Important financial stress indicators such as CLIFS and SovCISS and economic expectations are also significant. The model is robust to various specifications and has a better performance when post-crisis observations are not included.

AB  - Combining neural networks with continuous logic and multicriteria decision-making tools can reduce the black-box nature of neural models. In this study, we show that nilpotent logical systems offer an appropriate mathematical framework for hybridization of continuous nilpotent logic and neural models, helping to improve the interpretability and safety of machine learning. In our concept, perceptrons model soft inequalities; namely membership functions and continuous logical operators. We design the network architecture before training, using continuous logical operators and multicriteria decision tools with given weights working in the hidden layers. Designing the structure appropriately leads to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters to be learned. The theoretical basis offers a straightforward choice of activation functions (the cutting function or its differentiable approximation, the squashing function), and also suggests an explanation to the great success of the rectified linear unit (ReLU). In this study, we focus on the architecture of a hybrid model and introduce the building blocks for future applications in deep neural networks.

AB  - Supply chain disruptions have serious consequences for society and this has made supply chain risk management (SCRM) an attractive area for researchers and managers. In this paper, we use an objective literature mapping approach to identify, classify, and analyze decision-making models and support systems for SCRM, providing an agenda for future research. Through bibliometric networks of articles published in the Scopus database, we analyze the most influential decision-making models and support systems for SCRM, evaluate the main areas of current research, and provide insights for future research in this field. The main results are the following: we found that the identity of the area is structured in three groups of risk decision support models: (i) quantitative multicriteria decision models, (ii) stochastic decision-making models, and (iii) computational simulation/optimization models. We mapped six current research clusters: (i) conceptual and qualitative risk models, (ii) upstream supply chain risk models, (iii) downstream supply chain risk models, (iv) supply chain sustainability risk models, (v) stochastic and multicriteria decision risk models, and (vi) emerging techniques risk models. We identified seven future research clusters, with insights from further studies for: (i) tools to operate SCRM data, (ii) validation of risk models, (iii) computational improvement for data analysis, (iv) multi-level and multi-period supply chains, (v) agrifood risks, (vi) energy risks and (vii) sustainability risks. Finally, the future research agenda should prioritize SCRM's holistic vision, the relationship between Big Data, Industry 4.0 and SCRM, as well as emerging social and environmental risks.

AB  - System transition toward manufacturing sustainability is a technically very challenging process, as it requires continuous sustainability assessment and decision analysis in order to derive best possible solutions for implementation. This process could be facilitated by employing smart manufacturing technologies that are able to establish an environment for high-accuracy modeling and model-based manufacturing, semantic and ontology-based engineering, etc. This chapter introduces a decision support framework for sustainable and smart manufacturing. The introduced framework is equipped with a data analytics block that is responsible for both sustainability assessment and monitoring of external factors that may affect the sustainability performance of the system in its transition process. A model predictive control (MPC) strategy is adopted to identify and update optimal sustainability strategic plans for achieving short-to-long-term sustainability goals. The framework can provide a structured step-by-step guide to decision makers in formulating sustainability strategies and deriving and updating sustainability strategic plans intelligently.

AB  - Site suitability problems in renewable energy studies have taken a new turn since the advent of geographical information system (GIS). GIS has been used for site suitability analysis for renewable energy due to its prowess in processing and analyzing attributes with geospatial components. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tools are further used for criteria ranking in the order of influence on the study. Upon location of most appropriate sites, the need for intelligent resource forecast to aid in strategic and operational planning becomes necessary if viability of the investment will be enhanced and resource variability will be better understood. One of such intelligent models is the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and its variants. This study presents a mini-review of GIS-based MCDM facility location problems in wind and solar resource site suitability analysis and resource forecast using ANFIS-based models. Also,a framework for the integration of the two concepts in wind and solar energy studies was presented. Various MCDM techniques for decision making with their strengths and weaknesses were presented. Country specific studies that apply GIS-based method in site suitability were presented with the criteria considered. Similarly, country-specific studies in ANFIS-based resource forecasts for wind and solar energy were also presented. From our findings, there has been no technically valid range of values for spatial criteria in site suitability process for wind and solar resource exploration and the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) has been commonly used for criteria ranking, thus, leaving other MCDM techniques less explored. Also, hybrid ANFIS models are more effective compared to standalone ANFIS models in resource forecast, and ANFIS optimized with population-based models has been mostly used. Finally, we present a roadmap for integrating GIS-MCDM site suitability studies with ANFIS-based modeling for improved strategic and operational planning.

This paper will discuss a model to produce adaptive rules that originate from a number of different databases, automated threshold determination and rule ranking based on predetermined criteria. The adaptive rule model produced can be implemented in recommender systems in various fields.

AB  - This chapter discusses fuzzy logic, fuzzy linear programming (FLP), fuzzy multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), and their application in medicine. Fuzzy logic is a soft-computing technique that studies reasoning systems in which the notions of truth and falsehood are considered in a graded fashion. Fuzzy logic is suitable for developing knowledge-based systems in medicine and also in tasks such as diagnosis of diseases, selection of medical treatments, and real-time monitoring of patients' data. Fuzzy logic has several modeling approaches, such as linear programming, nonlinear programming, geometric programming, dynamic programming, and integer programming. These approaches are combined with fuzzy logic to create an optimum point under vague conditions, which gives a more flexible option to the decision-maker. Fuzzy multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been employed in medicine because of its efficiency and effectiveness at evaluating alternatives with multiple conflicting criteria.

This is especially true for complex models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which are the best-suited algorithms for modeling very complex and nonlinear relationships. But this need to understand has become a must since privacy regulations are hardening the industrial use of these models. There are different techniques to address the interpretability issues that Machine Learning models arises. This paper is focused on opening the so-called Deep Neural architectures black-box. This research extends the technique called Layer-wise Relevant Propagation (LRP) enhancing its properties to compute the most critical paths in different deep neural architectures using multicriteria analysis. We call this technique Ranked-LRP and it was tested on four different datasets and tasks, including classification and regression. The results show the worth of our proposal.

In addition, manually-curated background knowledge is a scarce resource for many domains. Ontology learning is a relatively new research area that draws from related fields. However, a number of approaches are still rising up and, what is more, they vary and evolve across different aspects. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide comprehensive knowledge about selected groups of methods, tools and approaches supporting ontology. Presenting different approaches to learning ontology and including them in one publicly available summary, aims to provide an overview of the most appropriate methods, tools and approaches to building ontologies from various sources. Besides, the proposed solution in this article will expand the already offered ontology of learning methods with additional, more detailed functions. In addition to the domain ontology offered, this is another goal of this article. The correctness of the proposed ontology was verified by the constructed competence questions and implemented using Description Logic query mechanism.

We demonstrate how MCDA using multi-attribute value functions can be implemented in a Bayesian network with decision and utility nodes. An object-oriented Bayesian network is used to integrate impacts computed in quantitative sub-models of hydropower revenues and Atlantic salmon smolt production and qualitative judgement models of mesohabitat fishability and riverscape aesthetics. We show how conditional probability tables are useful for modelling uncertainty in value scaling functions, and variance in criteria weights due to different stakeholder preferences. While the paper demonstrates the technical feasibility of MCDA in a BN, we also discuss the challenges of providing decision-support to a real-world habitat remediation process.

AB  - Multi-criteria-based group decision-making methods are important in the area of data science. Many of such works are focused on multi criteria with crisp inputs. However, in practice approximate reasoning methodology is used to address multi criteria. In general decision-making problems are categorized as problems under uncertain environment where uncertainty is due to fuzziness of criteria for the set of substitutes. In order to select the best among the available feasible alternatives, it is mandatory to execute multi-criteria decision-making problem using soft computing approach. In this study, we have developed performance index algorithm to implement the methodology of fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methodologies. A fuzzy likeness between evaluation alternatives and extreme solutions of a decision matrix is the backbone of performance index algorithm. The computation steps of proposed fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making method are quite simple, efficient & it is also one of the goals of this paper to reduce computational loads for a multi-criteria decision-making problem under fuzzy environment. Proposed method is compared with a standard method for order preference through comparison to ideal outcomes.

In this study, the Analytic Network Process (ANP), which can be used as a multicriteria decision-making tool, was utilized for the evaluation of three different pavement maintenance and rehabilitation projects in Sri Lanka. Social and economic factors that affected the three projects were considered and the inner and outer dependencies among them were evaluated and weighted. Pairwise comparisons were conducted complemented by interviews of transportation experts from the Road Development Authority (RDA) of Sri Lanka. Given that the RDA’s current method only considers economic factors, our results highlighted differences between the two methods. Therefore, ANP could be recommended for prioritizing pavement maintenance and rehabilitation projects in Sri Lanka.

AB  - Identifying key quality characteristics (QCs) in production processes is essential for product quality control and improvement. This paper proposes a multiobjective wrapper-based feature selection (FS) method for key QC (KQC) identification on unbalanced production data using a novel modified nondominated-sorting-based whale optimization algorithm (MNSWOA) and the ideal point method (IPM). In the proposed approach, the FS problem is defined as maximizing the geometric mean (GM) measure and minimizing the feature (QC) subset size. To solve the defined FS problem, MNSWOA is adopted first to find a set of candidate solutions (feature subsets), and then IPM is adopted to select the final solution. In MNSWOA, a modified fast nondominated sorting approach is proposed to adapt the single objective whale optimization algorithm to the multiobjective scenario. Moreover, a uniform reference solution selection strategy and the mutation operations are embedded in MNSWOA to improve its search performance. Experimental results on four unbalanced production datasets show that the proposed FS method performs effectively and efficiently for KQC identification. Further comparisons show that MNSWOA obtains better search performance than benchmark multiobjective optimization methods, including a modified NSGA-II, SPEA2, MOEA/D, NSPSO and CMDPSO.

AB  - In supply chain inventory management it is generally accepted that safety stocks are a suitable strategy to deal with demand and supply uncertainty aiming to prevent inventory stock-outs. Safety stocks have been the subject of intensive research, typically covering the problems of dimensioning, positioning, managing and placement. Here, we narrow the scope of the discussion to the safety stock dimensioning problem, consisting in determining the proper safety stock level for each product. This paper reports the results of a recent in-depth systematic literature review (SLR) of operations research (OR) models and methods for dimensioning safety stocks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of the application of OR-based approaches to investigate this problem. A set of 95 papers published from 1977 to 2019 has been reviewed to identify the type of model being employed, as well as the modeling techniques and main performance criteria used. At the end, we highlight current literature gaps and discuss potential research directions and trends that may help to guide researchers and practitioners interested in the development of new OR-based approaches for safety stock determination.

AB  - Ontologies are a key element of the Semantic Web. They aim to capture basic knowledge by providing appropriate terms and formal relationships between them, so that they can be used in a machine-processable manner. Accordingly they enable automatic aggregation and practical use as well as unexpected reuse of distributed data sources. Ontologies may come from many different sources, pursuing different goals and quality criteria. However, performed manually ontology construction is a very complex and tedious task, thus many methods proposed offer automatic or semi-automatic way for ontology construction. Many of the methods have their own, specific features. Therefore, this paper proposes an extensive knowledge-based approach covering the domain of ontology learning methods from text. This work aims to collect the knowledge of available approaches for ontology learning and the prominent differences between them, drawing on best practices in ontology engineering. The proposed approach refers to methods and aims to enrich knowledge in the field of ontology learning (OL). In this paper, the author’s ontology contains a set of various types of methods with main techniques used, and the necessary features in the miscellaneous approaches. The proposed an extensive knowledge-based approach uses a reasoning mechanism based on competency questions for individual approaches to determine their ontology learning method profiles. The validation stage has also been carried out. At the same time, it is an extension of the previous study in the form of a repository of knowledge about OL tools. In addition, the combination of both ontologies: tools and methods aim to provide a more efficient OL solution from text.

AB  - This work deals with the sorting of the suitability of the roofs for the integration of PV systems, implementable as a GIS (Geographical Information System). Such sorting can provide relevant information to help and guide urban actors further develop solar energy, and therefore contribute to the acceleration of the deployment of this source of energy in cities. Three scenarios of sorting are considered: the energetic, the economic and the multicriteria sorting. The energetic and economic sorting scenarios are actually similar to the great majority of the currently proposed sorting in publicly available solar GIS tools (solar cadastre), which consider only one attribute such as the solar irradiation or the payback period. Knowing the limits of these sorting scenarios, a multicriteria approach is adopted and takes into account more impactful attributes in the urban actors’ choices. The ELECTRE TRI methodology is used for this sorting problem. Different decisional criteria related to energy, economy, historic buildings and heritage, the structure and superstructure states of the roof are identified and detailed. The method is then applied to a set of alternatives (roofs) in a district of Geneva. The sorting results show that the proposed multicriteria scenario better integrates the complexity of the urban environment and provides a more relevant information regarding the suitability of the roofs for PV integration.

AB  - Operations Research/Management Science (OR/MS) has traditionally been defined as the discipline that applies advanced analytical methods to help make better and more informed decisions. The purpose of this paper is to present an analysis of the existing knowledge base of OR/MS research and practice using a proposed keywords-based approach. A conceptual structure is necessary in order to place in context the findings of our keyword analysis. Towards this we first present a classification scheme that relies on keywords that appeared in articles published in important OR/MS journals from 1990–2019 (over 82,000 articles). Our classification scheme applies a methodological approach towards keyword selection and its systematic classification, wherein approximately 1300 most frequently used keywords (in terms of cumulative percentage, these keywords and their derivations account for more than 45% of the approx. 290,000 keyword occurrences used by the authors to represent the content of their articles) were selected and organised in a classification scheme with seven top-level categories and multiple levels of sub-categories. The scheme identified the most commonly used keywords relating to OR/MS problems, modeling techniques and applications. Next, we use this proposed scheme to present an analysis of the last 30 years, in three distinct time periods, to show the changes in OR/MS literature. The contribution of the paper is thus twofold, (a) the development of a proposed discipline-based classification of keywords (like the ACM Computer Classification System and the AMS Mathematics Subject Classification), and (b) an analysis of OR/MS research and practice using the proposed classification.

Selecting the most suitable IoT applications for individual users is a critical challenge. This study aims to solve this challenge by proposing recommendation system using a hybrid multicriteria decision-making approach based on the analytical hierarchy process and simple additive weight methods. Based on the opinions and preferences of experts, the model and the hierarchy were designed to assess and compare three crucial criteria, namely smart objects, applications, and providers. The results show that applications criterion is more important for users than the other two criteria. In specific, privacy, reliability, and availability are crucial criteria for IoT applications.

AB  - Epidemiological time series forecasting plays an important role in health public systems, due to its ability to allow managers to develop strategic planning to avoid possible epidemics. In this paper, a hybrid learning framework is developed to forecast multi-step-ahead (one, two, and three-month-ahead) meningitis cases in four states of Brazil. First, the proposed approach applies an ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to decompose the data into intrinsic mode functions and residual components. Then, each component is used as the input of five different forecasting models, and, from there, forecasted results are obtained. Finally, all combinations of models and components are developed, and for each case, the forecasted results are weighted integrated (WI) to formulate a heterogeneous ensemble forecaster for the monthly meningitis cases. In the final stage, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) using the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm – version II is employed to find a set of candidates’ weights, and then the Technique for Order of Preference by similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to choose the adequate set of weights. Next, the most adequate model is the one with the best generalization capacity out-of-sample in terms of performance criteria including mean absolute error (MAE), relative root mean squared error (RRMSE), and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE). By using MOO, the intention is to enhance the performance of the forecasting models by improving simultaneously their accuracy and stability measures. To access the model’s performance, comparisons based on metrics are conducted with: (i) EEMD, heterogeneous ensemble integrated by direct strategy, or simple sum; (ii) EEMD, homogeneous ensemble of components WI; (iii) models without signal decomposition. At this stage, MAE, RRMSE, and sMAPE criteria as well as Diebold–Mariano statistical test are adopted. In all twelve scenarios, the proposed framework was able to perform more accurate and stable forecasts, which showed, on 89.17% of the cases, that the errors of the proposed approach are statistically lower than other approaches. These results showed that combining EEMD, heterogeneous ensemble and WI with weights obtained by optimization can develop precise and stable forecasts. The modeling developed in this paper is promising and can be used by managers to support decision making.

AB  - Hyper-heuristics have emerged as a way to raise the level of generality of search techniques for computational search problems. This is in contrast to many approaches, which represent customised methods for a single problem domain or a narrow class of problem instances. The term hyper-heuristic was defined in the early 2000s as a heuristic to choose heuristics, but the idea of designing high-level heuristic methodologies can be traced back to the early 1960s. The current state-of-the-art in hyper-heuristic research comprises a set of methods that are broadly concerned with intelligently selecting or generating a suitable heuristic for a given situation. Hyper-heuristics can be considered as search methods that operate on lower-level heuristics or heuristic components, and can be categorised into two main classes: heuristic selection and heuristic generation. Here we will focus on the first of these two categories, selection hyper-heuristics. This paper gives a brief history of this emerging area, reviews contemporary selection hyper-heuristic literature, and discusses recent selection hyper-heuristic frameworks. In addition, the existing classification of selection hyper-heuristics is extended, in order to reflect the nature of the challenges faced in contemporary research. Unlike the survey on hyper-heuristics published in 2013, this paper focuses only on selection hyper-heuristics and presents critical discussion, current research trends and directions for future research.

AB  - Increasing attention was given to building information modeling (BIM) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) globally due to their advantages for various stages of the life cycle of a building. The aim of this paper is to improve practitioners' understanding of the process for BIM and MCDM adoption towards sustainable construction through energy efficiency. A questionnaire survey is being conducted for construction professionals and building industry experts in Malaysia. With expert survey data, a multi-criteria decision model using analytical network process (ANP) was built to identify key factors affecting sustainable building by reducing both embodied and operational energy and carbon emissions. Data from the survey was analysed using descriptive statistics. Model developed consisted of three clusters with a total of six nodes, and the level of importance was compared pairwise with one another. Results shows that design optimisation, reduced material requirements are important factors for sustainable construction considered in the BIM application.

AB  - The theories of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and fuzzy logic both aim to model human thinking. In MCDM, aggregation processes and preference modeling play the central role. This paper suggests a consistent framework for modeling human thinking by using the tools of both fields: fuzzy logical operators as well as aggregation and preference operators. In this framework, aggregation, preference, and the logical operators are described by the same unary generator function. Similarly to the implication being defined as a composition of the disjunction and the negation operator, preference operators were introduced as a composition of the aggregative operator and the negation operator. After a profound examination of the main properties of the preference operator, our main goal is the implementation into neural networks. We show how preference can be modeled by a perceptron, and illustrate the results in practical neural applications.

AB  - Malware programs currently represent the most serious threat to computer information systems. Despite the performed efforts of researchers in this field, detection tools still have limitations for one main reason. Actually, malware developers usually use obfuscation techniques consisting in a set of transformations that make the code and/or its execution difficult to analyze by hindering both manual and automated inspections. These techniques allow the malware to escape the detection tools, and hence to be seen as a benign program. To solve the obfuscation issue, many researchers have proposed to extract frequent Application Programming Interface (API) call sequences from previously encountered malware programs using pattern mining techniques and hence, build a base of fraudulent behaviors. Based on this process, it is worth mentioning that the performance of the detection process heavily depends on the base of examples of malware behaviors; also called malware patterns. In order to deal with this shortcoming, a dynamic detection method called Artificial Malware-based Detection (AMD) is proposed in this paper. AMD makes use of not only extracted malware patterns but also artificially generated ones. The artificial malware patterns are generated using an evolutionary (genetic) algorithm. The latter evolves a population of API call sequences with the aim to find new malware behaviors following a set of well-defined evolution rules. The artificial fraudulent behaviors are subsequently inserted into the base of examples in order to enrich it with unseen malware patterns. The main motivation behind the proposed AMD approach is to diversify the base of malware examples in order to maximize the detection rate. AMD has been tested on different Android malware data sets and compared against recent prominent works using commonly employed performance metrics. The performance analysis of the obtained results shows the merits of our AMD novel approach.

AB  - World population forecasted growth, ageing population, rising urbanization and congestion levels carry several challenges inside urban mobility systems. The digitalization megatrend is reshaping lives worldwide while at the same time “Usership” is thriving along collaborative consumption. “Mobility-as-a-Service” (“MaaS”) emerges as a potential mobility disruption, in this new mobility ecosystem. Inspired in Finland's “MaaS” ecosystem, this paper aims to propose a “Mobility as a Service Public Policy Framework” with a two-stage approach. First structuring the “MaaS” concept, looking for the core features, its relations, that leads to its reconceptualization and a topology proposal. Secondly, a public policy framework is proposed, considering the policy instruments, indicative group of stakeholders responsible and the different urban mobility management decision levels. The authors argue that is fundamental to understand the nature of decisions which are intimately connected with the Urban Mobility system, to design and implement a coherent and effective policy framework, where the policy tools chosen to materialize policy decisions regarding “MaaS” should first consider the identification of the founding pillars of the “MaaS” concept, guiding the process of policy design accordingly. If “MaaS” is considered a Mobility Management tool, it can constitute an opportunity to redefine public transport and its financing.

AB  - Agriculture is by its nature a complicated scientific field, related to a wide range of expertise, skills, methods and processes which can be effectively supported by computerized systems. There have been many efforts towards the establishment of an automated agriculture framework, capable to control both the incoming data and the corresponding processes. The recent advances in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) domain have the capability to collect, process and analyze data from different sources while materializing the concept of agriculture intelligence. The thriving environment for the implementation of different agriculture systems is justified by a series of technologies that offer the prospect of improving agricultural productivity through the intensive use of data. The concept of big data in agriculture is not exclusively related to big volume, but also on the variety and velocity of the collected data. Big data is a key concept for the future development of agriculture as it offers unprecedented capabilities and it enables various tools and services capable to change its current status. This survey paper covers the state-of-the-art agriculture systems and big data architectures both in research and commercial status in an effort to bridge the knowledge gap between agriculture systems and exploitation of big data. The first part of the paper is devoted to the exploration of the existing agriculture systems, providing the necessary background information for their evolution until they have reached the current status, able to support different platforms and handle multiple sources of information. The second part of the survey is focused on the exploitation of multiple sources of information, providing information for both the nature of the data and the combination of different sources of data in order to explore the full potential of ICT systems in agriculture.

AB  - Bank failure prediction models usually combine financial attributes through binary classification approaches. In this study we extend this standard framework in three main directions. First, we explore the predictive power of attributes that describe the diversification of banking operations. Second, we consider the prediction of failure in a multi-period context. Finally, an enhanced ordinal classification framework is introduced, which considers multiple instances of failed banks prior to failure (up to three years prior to bankruptcy). Various ordinal models are developed using techniques from multiple criteria decision analysis, statistics, and machine learning. Moreover, ensemble models based on error-correcting output codes are examined. The analysis is based on a sample consisting of approximately 60,000 observations for banks in the United States over the period 2006–2015. The results show that diversification attributes improve the predictive power of bank failure prediction models, mainly for mid to long-term prediction horizons. Moreover, ordinal classification models provide a better description of the state of the banks prior to failure and are competitive to standard binary classification models.

AB  - The publication indicator of the Finnish research funding system is based on a manual ranking of scholarly publication channels. These ranks, which represent the evaluated quality of the channels, are continuously kept up to date and thoroughly reevaluated every four years by groups of nominated scholars belonging to different disciplinary panels. This expert-based decision-making process is informed by available citation-based metrics and other relevant metadata characterizing the publication channels. The purpose of this paper is to introduce various approaches that can explain the basis and evolution of the quality of publication channels, i.e., ranks. This is important for the academic community, whose research work is being governed using the system. Data-based models that, with sufficient accuracy, explain the level of or changes in ranks provide assistance to the panels in their multi-objective decision making, thus suggesting and supporting the need to use more cost-effective, automated ranking mechanisms. The analysis relies on novel advances in machine learning systems for classification and predictive analysis, with special emphasis on local and global feature importance techniques.

AB  - The study provides a useful tool to enable local decision makers to define territorial sustainable policies. For this purpose, using selected indicators, we analyse, at the municipal level, the behaviour of and interactions among the socio-demographic, environmental, economic, and accessibility dimensions in two northern Italian provinces in the Alpine Chain (NUTS3), which are identified by the EU as predominantly rural areas. We adopt the dominance-based rough set approach, which allows for the discovery of hidden patterns among the data by means of the generation of decision rules. The population variation over time and number of foreign citizens are the decision attributes considered together with condition attributes belonging to the socio-demographic, environmental, economic, and accessibility dimensions. Our selected areas (rural, mountainous, and peripheral) present various facets at the sustainability level, largely due to their complexity, which was confirmed by the rules we found. Moreover, the socio-demographic and accessibility attributes are more commonly present in the rules and a low interaction characterizes the four dimensions. Finally, economic growth is often at odds with environmental sustainability.

AB  - Devices have been getting smaller, smarter, and more energy efficient, leading to our smart computing era. Smart cities are transforming our everyday lives through the integration of their core services. A major part of the power consumed by cities is used by street illumination. The conventional illumination method consumes high power and rapidly depletes luminaire lifetime. In this chapter, a Centralized Eco-Friendly Role Assignment Scheme (CEFRAS) has been proposed for smart city street illumination considering requirements such as luminaire type, lighting duration, and zone. System modeling with simulation of the lighting applications facilitates testing various kinds of luminaires in a very large-scale environment. Investigations on performance metrics such as illumination level, power consumption, and luminaire lifetime were performed on the (i) conventional, (ii) static, and (iii) dynamic CEFRAS. The dynamic-CEFRAS in comparison to the static-CEFRAS and conventional method is shown to increase the luminaire lifetime by 25.94% and 33.94%, respectively. The power consumption of the luminaires is minimized by 7.31% and 8.18% by the dynamic-CEFRAS in comparison to static-CEFRAS and the conventional method. Thus, the dynamic-CEFRAS increases the overall lifetime of the luminaires and minimizes the overall power consumption.

AB  - The design and multiobjective optimization of graded foam-cored sandwich cylinders (GFSCs) composed of tubular face sheets and layered gradient foam core under internal air-blast loading were examined. The response surface method and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm were used in the defined optimization problem to determine the optimal face-sheet thickness and core gradient as well as achieve the minimum specific deflection of outer face sheet (SDF) and maximum specific energy absorption (SEA). Multiobjective optimization was subsequently conducted to obtain the Pareto front and improve the blast-resistant performance of the optimum GFSC configuration. Results obtained via these optimizations further indicated that the optimal GFSCs demonstrated better energy absorption characteristics than ordinary sandwich cylinders. Under the same SDF, SEA increased by 75.4% and 45.0% compared with that of the initial baseline design when the core gradient and face-sheet thickness were individually optimized, respectively. The joint optimization of face-sheet thicknesses and core gradient could significantly improve the blast-resistant performance by 171.1%. The optimization of GFSCs should primarily optimize the design variables with high-price performance ratio while reasonably arranging the design variable quantity, ensuring the controllable cost of calculation, and significantly improving the blast-resistant performance. The results also showed that the strength of CFSCs and the interaction between the face sheets and the core improved the blast-resistant capacity. The design optimization results could provide appropriate guidance in the crashworthiness design of GFSCs.

AB  - The integration of food-energy-water (FEW) sectors is essential for addressing the co-evolution of urban infrastructure systems during urban growth. But how these evolutionary pathways can affect an urban growth model is unclear. This review paper offers a synthesis of the current philosophy of a FEW nexus in connection with the realm of urban growth models (UGMs) to signify the paradigm collision and shift with interdisciplinary sustainability insights. Findings indicate that urban metabolism and urban ecology in relation to FEW sectors can be incorporated into UGMs with scales via multicriteria decision analysis as FEW technology hub integration can play a critical role in UGMs via a common cellular automata (CA) architecture for both model construction and solution procedure. Synergies between FEW sectors and CA-based UGMs as well as tradeoffs across FEW technology hub integration are highlighted to reflect the cascade effects and higher order impact on urban metabolism and urban ecology. This concept was confirmed with a case study in Miami, Florida, the United States for demonstration. Such synergistic framework is helpful for fostering more sustainable, green, smart, forward-looking, environmentally-sound, socially equitable, risk-informed, resilient, and cost-effective urban growth simulations. It is anticipated that the proposed hybrid FEW-CA-based UGMs can fully account for interactions of context- and culture-driven issues for multi-scale and multiagent urban planning and design in different countries.

AB  - The tasks of democratic urban land use planning, as subjective-objective combined decision-making efforts that require considerable time and energy, have heretofore been accomplished mainly through deep human thought or by voting. In this paper, we introduce a goal-reasoning artificial intelligence (AI) agent that can assist with these tasks by combining traditional scenario planning, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) with a novel goal-oriented Monte Carlo tree search (G-MCTS) method. G-MCTS conducts goal-oriented searches to meet the needs of heterogeneous goals and provide the best land use solutions. We evaluated this method on a real-world planning case, and the results show that 1) the goal-reasoning AI agent is good at performing complex goal reasoning tasks with many heterogeneous expert knowledge; 2) different human planning manuscripts could be integrated into a better solution via a goal-reasoning AI agent; and 3) the goal-reasoning AI agent has the potential to make comprehensive decisions during a democratic political agenda. We conclude that the goal-reasoning AI agent, via an improved reinforcement learning (RL) method of G-MCTS, provides vast potential for assisting in subjective-objective combined urban land use planning and many other similar fields by weighing heterogeneous goals, reproducing human inspiration, and acting as a reflexive sociotechnical system.

AB  - A soil chemical quality index is designed for cacao production systems. It is based on worldwide scientific knowledge and built using data from three municipalities of Tolima department in Colombia. Fuzzy logic is used in a multicriteria decision making framework in two different ways. First, fuzzy sets are used to model an expert preference relation for each of the individual information sources to turn raw data into satisfaction degrees. Second, fuzzy rules are used to model the interaction between sources to aggregate the individual degrees into a global score. The whole framework is implemented as an open source software called GeoFIS. A part of the data was used for calibration, then the remaining data served as a validation set. The results were easy to analyze and in agreement with field observations. The output inferred by the fuzzy inference system was used as a target to learn the weights of classical numerical aggregation operators. Only the Choquet Integral proved to have a similar modeling ability, but its optimal tuning would have been difficult without learning.

KW  - Multicriteria decision analysis
AB  - Context
The nonspecific storage symptom complex overactive bladder (OAB) is an important clinical condition in functional urology. Until recently, pharmacological therapy comprised antimuscarinic drugs, but more recently beta 3 agonists have added to the available agents. Traditional reporting of efficacy and safety of these agents relies upon regulatory placebo-controlled studies. There remains no head-to-head comparison of existing agents in the contemporary literature. Contemporary conclusions on comparative efficacy and safety drawn from the use of these agents are based on systematic reviews of the literature and associated meta-analyses.
Objective
In this study, we used the analytical model of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) to compare contemporary pharmacotherapy for OAB.
Evidence acquisition
Efficacy and safety data from published, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of antimuscarinic antagonists, the beta 3 agonist, and the combination of an antimuscarinic and beta 3 agonist were used to populate the MCDA model.
Evidence synthesis
Experts assessed weights of the relative importance of favourable and unfavourable effects, which provided a common measure of benefits and safety that were combined in the MCDA model to give an overall ranking of the OAB drugs.
Results
When benefits are judged as more important than safety, fesoterodine 4 or 8mg used in a flexible dosing pattern provides the most favourable therapeutic option, over a wide sensitivity analysis relating to benefits and harms.
Conclusions
In our analysis using an MCDA model, in both the flexible dosing pattern of fesoterodine and the solifenacin combination with mirabegron, the benefit-safety balance is better in terms of benefits and/or safety than any of the other available OAB drugs. Caution in interpretation of the data has to be expressed as the fesoterodine data are based on a flexible dosing regimen, which adds an additional dimension of personalising therapy.
Patient summary
Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition with a significant impact on the quality of life. Possible symptoms include the following: (1) urgency—a compelling desire to urinate, which is difficult to defer; (2) urgency urinary incontinence—urgency leading to incontinence episodes; (3) frequency—increased frequency of wanting to pass urine; and (4) nocturia—increase in instances of getting up at night to urinate. To date, the mainstay of therapy for OAB has been antimuscarinic drugs and, more recently, the beta 3 agonist mirabegron. Ten international experts in urology, obstetrics, gynaecology, healthy ageing, and data analysis compared the benefit-risk balance of 14 OAB drugs licensed in Europe. The experts considered the importance of a favourable effect on the above four symptoms and also potential for side effects, but only three of these side effects, constipation, dry mouth, and dizziness, showed clinically relevant differences among the six drugs they considered. The observations recorded here suggest interesting differences between drugs across a wide range of possible trade-offs between benefit and safety. The different recruitment criteria used for each study may influence the results seen, so they need to be treated with caution. Comparison of flexibly dosed fesoterodine studies with fixed-dose fesoterodine studies introduces an additional potential bias; definitive conclusions can be drawn only if enough comparable placebo-controlled flexible dosing studies with other drugs were available.

AB  - Chemometrics plays a fundamental role in quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) and quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs) methods, which aim at empirically linking the molecular structure of chemicals to experimentally-measurable properties. In fact, chemometrics statistics and chemoinformatics are the basic tools for finding meaningful mathematical relationships between the molecular structure and biological, physico-chemical, toxicological and environmental properties of chemicals. The key elements of QSAR/QSPR are molecular descriptors, which are numerical indices encoding information related to the structure of chemicals and are used as independent variables in the subsequent modeling, thus connecting the QSAR approaches to the multivariate and chemometric world. In this article, historical and novel QSAR modeling approaches are presented. After describing the historical background of QSAR and the classical approaches, molecular descriptors are illustrated, with state-of-the-art as well as novel description methodologies. Additionally, the key principles of QSAR are introduced, along with specific elements of the QSAR modeling workflow, e.g., variable reduction and selection, similarity-based approaches, validation, the definition of applicability domain and consensus modeling.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology to improve the identification of causal relationships of an existing strategy map of a company, using a multi-decision criteria method. A strategy map is one of the components of a balanced scorecard (BSC). It contains strategic objectives grouped into four perspectives and the cause-effect link between those objectives. There is no “standard” method for identifying those relationships. In many companies, they are identified conceptually, using the experience and knowledge of the company's managers. Even though, the literature presents a number of articles using multicriteria decision methods to model a balanced scorecard, only a few of them deal with the identification of the causal relationships. However, t is assumed (by the authors) that the strategy map obtained using their method is better than strategy map that would have been obtained using only the judgment of managers. This paper does not assume that and this is the reason why the existing strategy map (or a map obtained using a qualitative approach) is combined with a map obtained by using a quantitative method to arrive to a final strategy map. This is the contribution of the paper. The method uses the Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method to identify the relationships of a strategy map. Then the resulting map is compared with the existing strategy map (or a map obtained using a qualitative approach). To identify the similarities and differences the K-means clustering method is used. From those similarities and differences found, it is decided which causal relationships will be included in the final strategy map. As an illustration, the application of the proposed methodology in a manufacturing company is shown.

AB  - Taking into account the exponential growth of the number of flash-floods events worldwide, the detection of areas prone to these natural hazards is one of the main activities taken in order to mitigate the negative effects of these risk phenomena. In the present paper, new modeling approaches, Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) integrated with IOE (ADT-IOE) and ADT integrated with AHP (ADT-AHP), were proposed for flash-flood susceptibility mapping across the Suha river catchment (Romania). Besides, two stand-alone methods, Index of Entropy (IOE) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), were also investigated. For this regard, 111 torrential points and 111 non-torrential points along with 8 flash-flood conditioning factors have been involved in the training process of the four models. The quality of the flash-flood models was checked by using the ROC Curve method, classification accuracy (CLA), and Kappa index. The result shows that the two ensemble models, the ADT-IOE (AUC = 0.972, CLC = 86.37%, Kappa statistics = 0.727) and the ADT-AHP (AUC = 0.926, CLA = 87.88%, Kappa statistics = 0.758), have high prediction performance and outperform the other models. Therefore, ADT-IOE and ADT-AHP are new and promising tools for flash-flood susceptibility modeling.

AB  - The current study presents a novel combination of artificial neural network cross-validation (fourfold ANN-CV) with a hybrid analytic hierarchy process-Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (AHP-TOPSIS) method to improve the earthquake risk assessment (ERA) and applied it to Aceh, Indonesia, to test the model. Recent studies have suggested that neural networks improve probability mapping in a city scale. The network architecture design with probability index remains unexplored in earthquake-based probability studies. This study explored and specified the major indicators needed to improve the predictive accuracy in probability mapping. First, probability mapping was conducted and used for hazard assessment in the next step. Second, a vulnerability map was created based on social and structural factors. Finally, hazard and vulnerability indices were multiplied to produce the ERA, and the population and areas under risk were calculated. Results show that the proposed model achieves 85.4% accuracy, and its consistency ratio is 0.06. Risk varies from very high to high in the city center, approximately covering an area of 23% (14.82 km2) and a total population of 54,695. The model's performance changes on the basis of the input parameters, indicating the selection and importance of input layers on network architecture selection. The proposed model is found to generalize better results than traditional and some existing probabilistic models. The proposed model is simple and transferable to other regions by localizing the input parameters that contribute to earthquake risk mitigation and prevention planning.

AB  - Characterizing zone fragility is a significant challenge when managing natural areas, but it must be prioritized in conservation efforts. The most commonly employed methodology is to rely on criteria established by experts, which can introduce subjectivity. However, more objective approaches should be used when developing conservation plans. This study follows one methodology focusing on classifying zone vulnerability within a protected natural area, taking as a study case a temporal pond network located in SW Spain; threatened aquatic plants were used as a bioindicators. Spatial data were analyzed using geographic information systems (GIS), and potentially vulnerable zones were identified using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) and, more specifically, the weighted overlay method. Criteria weights were determined by variables contribution obtained through species distribution models (SDM), via the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt). The purpose was to avoid artificial bias in decision-making. The analysis indicated that 42.04% of the study area was highly vulnerable. In contrast, only the 14.34% of the study area was at very low risk, meaning it can help maintain pond network biodiversity. These results indicate that potentially vulnerable and crucial zones can be identified using GIS, facilitating the establishment of conservation priorities in a complex system. This methodology could be useful for prioritizing and implementing management and conservation efforts focused on unique species and habitats in protected natural areas.

These mobile devices change the way we communicate and allow ever-present learning in various environments. This study examined educational chatbots for Facebook Messenger to support learning. The independent web directory was screened to assess chatbots for this study resulting in the identification of 89 unique chatbots. Each chatbot was classified by language, subject matter and developer's platform. Finally, we evaluated 47 educational chatbots using the Facebook Messenger platform based on the analytic hierarchy process against the quality attributes of teaching, humanity, affect, and accessibility. We found that educational chatbots on the Facebook Messenger platform vary from the basic level of sending personalized messages to recommending learning content. Results show that chatbots which are part of the instant messaging application are still in its early stages to become artificial intelligence teaching assistants. The findings provide tips for teachers to integrate chatbots into classroom practice and advice what types of chatbots they can try out.

AB  - Combining wind power with pumped-storage systems is trustworthy for reducing the unreliability of wind energy, caused by the variable nature of the wind for contributing to the grid's peak shaving. Locating suitable sites for constructing both wind parks and pumped-storage systems for peak shaving is a delicate problem-solving. For solving such problems, a wide range of technical, financial, and environmental criteria should be taken into account. A two-step decision framework combining GIS, Analytic Network Process (ANP) and fuzzy VIKOR are proposed in this paper to solve the problem for locating the suitable sites for constructing a wind-powered pump storage plant. In the first step, a GIS database is developed to locate a handful potential sites within the study area. As there are different and even conflicting criteria involved with site selection problem. In the second step, we used an MCDM approach of fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) and fuzzy VIKOR to rank these potential sites. To establish an evaluation system, four major clusters of criteria are introduced (wind farm, water reservoir, water pump and power production) with more addition related sub-criteria. Comprehensive guidelines are formulated through a hierarchical procedure so a data-driven, multi-aspect decision framework could be presented with the goal of improving the benefits of integrated renewable energies. The results show that, the Gilane-Gharb dam is the most promising site within the study area. This site provides a net area of 13.2 km2 for constructing a wind farm with an approximate power capacity of 31 MW. The proposed procedure in this is a framework that are provide a theoretical reference for resolving any multicriteria decision-making problem by introducing the appropriate criteria.

AB  - With the advent of new generation information technologies (new IT) in industry and product design, the big data–driven product design era has arrived. However, current research mainly places emphasis on the analysis of physical data rather than the virtual models. In other words, the convergence between product’s physical and virtual spaces is usually absent. Fortunately, digital twin (DT), an emerging and fast-growing technology, provides a promising way to connect and integrate the physical and virtual spaces seamlessly, thus to solve the previous problem efficiently. Therefore this chapter introduces DT into product design and presents a new design method based on the DT approach. First, related theories and technologies of product design are reviewed and the concept of DT is explored. Then a five-dimension DT and its abilities enabled by new IT are proposed. Based on this, a DT-driven smart product design (DTPD) framework is discussed, in terms of key processes and related technologies. Finally, DTPD applications in bicycle and landing gear are presented as two case studies to illustrate the proposed method.

AB  - This study explores the nature of the correlation in data to estimate the data quality to be used in decision-making processes. The main contribution of this research is the introduction of a new multivariate method based on rotated factor scores by varimax strategy for the repeatability and reproducibility study to effectively identify possible data of poor quality leading to measurement errors. In addition, a new confidence ellipsoid-based decision support method is developed. The efficiency of the proposed method was demonstrated using the metallographic measurements of the geometric characteristics of the resistance spot welding process. To prove the efficiency of the proposed method, it was compared with other consolidated techniques such as the analysis of variance, weighted principal components method, and factor analysis without rotation. Thus, we verified that the proposed method performed better interpretation of the latent information, minimizing the dimensionality of the data, and separating the quality attributes analyzed by clusters. One response group was classified as acceptable, and the other as marginal. These results were verified by the confidence ellipsoids, in which the proposed method obeyed the Bonferroni bilateral limits, outlining the factors which demonstrated superior discriminatory power with non-overlapping ellipsoids avoiding the confounding and favoring the better data quality analysis for multicriteria decision-making. When compared with the other approaches, the proposed method demonstrated more reliable and robust results without such deficiencies as inversion of the groupings, neglection of the variance-covariance structure, and the variability attributed to the data within the measurement system.

AB  - A service supply chain can be described as a system of systems with a highly interactive and complex network of suppliers, service providers, OEMs and customers. Supply chain management could create value for bespoke service providers, customers and stakeholders cooperating through the supply chain. Bespoke service provider companies are responsible for managing their asset based on different service contracts and possibly through the end of the asset lifetime. Providing a through-life service requires tailored strategic dimensions to measure the supply chain performance. The performance can be evaluated with regards to several supply chain elements such as demand management, procurement, logistics, etc. This article takes a different angle to the current supply chain performance frameworks by discussing performance through DMAIC cycle. Considering a through-life service, this paper presents a performance optimization framework to improve the supply chain performance in terms of an asset or component availability and cost of service. Moreover, an exhaustive list of KPIs to evaluate the supply chain performance are identified. A case study of fleet management for a bespoke service provider is considered to test the validity of the framework. The DMAIC technique has demonstrated to be an effective method to improve supply chain strategies and performance.

AB  - Evaluating the performance of supply chains (SC) is a critical activity to enhance the outcomes of operations along the SC tiers. In order to support this evaluation process, several studies have proposed the application of artificial intelligence techniques combined with the performance metrics suggested by the SCOR® model (Supply Chain Operations Reference). However these propositions present some limitations. While the systems based on Mamdani fuzzy inference do not allow adaptation to the environment of use based on historical performance data, the systems based on artificial neural networks are not adequate to deal with imprecise data and qualitative metrics. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new approach to support SC performance evaluation based on the combination between the SCOR® metrics with an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). In total, 56 candidate topologies were implemented and assessed using MATLAB. The random subsampling cross-validation method was applied to select the most appropriate topological parameters for each ANFIS model. The mean square error between the target values and the values estimated by each ANFIS model demonstrate its greater accuracy of prediction. In addition, results of the hypothesis tests based on paired samples indicate that the proposed ANFIS models are adequate to support SC performance evaluation. The proposed system can help managers to develop improvement actions plans based on the outcomes of the evaluation process. When compared to previous approaches, it presents advantages such as greater accuracy of prediction, learning ability based on historical data, suitability to support decision making under uncertainty, better interpretability of results, among others.

Outpatients are a natural group to be monitored using IoT devices. Data semantics is a key topic in this regard, related mainly to risk prevention and support for data-driven decision making. In this chapter, an application of a measurement framework with the support of states and scenarios is introduced as a mean of homogenizing data semantics independently of the collector device. The application is focused on monitoring of outpatients engaged in physical activities outdoor. The project definition is detailed, along with the devices used in the implementation. The main contribution of this work is the integration of heterogeneous IoT devices through a measurement framework with the support of multiple scenarios and states, with data semantics used to guide the real-time data processing.

AB  - The rapid growth of information and communication technology captured common man and various organizations and influenced each individual’s life, work, and study. It leads to a data explosion. It has no utility without any analysis and leads to many analytical techniques. The prime objective of these techniques is to derive some useful knowledge. However, the transformation of data into knowledge is not easy because of many reasons, such as disorganized, incomplete, uncertainties, etc. Furthermore, analyzing uncertainties present in data is not a straight forward task. Many different models, like fuzzy sets, rough sets, soft sets, neural networks, generalizations, and hybrid models obtained by combining two or more of these models, have been fruitful in representing knowledge. To this end, this paper identifies the conventionally used rough computing techniques and discusses their concepts, developments, abstraction, hybridization, and scope of applications.

Here, we review the application of the life cycle optimization framework to chemical systems, where the key idea is to combine life cycle assessment (LCA) with multiobjective optimization (MOO) so as to identify solutions attaining simultaneously economic and environmental benefits. We introduce the fundamentals of this method and highlight its capabilities in three examples at various spatial and temporal scales, i.e., the sustainable design of hydrogen supply chains and process flowsheets and the environmental assessment of chemicals. We argue that the combined use of MOO and LCA will play a key role in the transition to a more sustainable chemical industry, yet we identify methodological and practical issues that still need to be resolved for its widespread use in industry.

AB  - The project selection problem has attracted significant attention among construction project participants. Typically, a contractor can execute one or more projects from available projects. This study introduces a new strategy to help contractors in evaluating and selecting suitable construction projects. The new strategy is based on identifying multiple criteria that affect construction projects as well as developing and using a model that supports decision based on the analytic hierarchy process. Furthermore, a fuzzy risk analysis model is proposed to analyze and quantify some of the identified criteria to help contractors select minimally risky projects. Market conditions, financial resources, project conditions, time delays, and cost overruns are five identified criteria that control the selection. Through identifying 70 subsidiary factors, the effects and importance of the first three criteria were determined through a field survey, while time delay and cost overrun criteria were analyzed and quantified through the risk analysis model. The new strategy was applied on a real case study comprising two HVAC system projects in the construction industry (project 1 in Egypt and project 2 in Saudi Arabia). Criteria and causes that yield different effects on the new strategy to support contractor decision and selection control are discussed in detail. Risk factors were ranked according to their importance, and their effects on both time and cost were clarified. The results obtained from the investigated case study showed 55.5% support for project 2, and only 44.5% support for project 1. This strategy is applicable to other case studies in different countries with different projects, criteria, and execution activities.
