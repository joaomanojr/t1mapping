AB  - In planning for sustainable development of urban green space at the macro and regional levels, it is imperative to examine plant species of urban green spaces and to introduce new species considering climatic conditions, environmental pollution, industrial lifestyle, and resource limitations. The present study employs multi criteria decision making techniques to assess the existing and recommended plant species (trees, shrubs, and hedge plants) in downtown and marginal parks of Rasht City, Iran. Twenty seven indicators were defined in the context of six criteria, namely regional adaptation, urban environment, aesthetics, maintenance, growth characteristics, and specific advantages. Weights were assigned to the criteria using the entropy method. They were subsequently ranked by Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Combinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS), Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS), and Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) techniques. To provide a final ranking of the ornamental species, the results of these four techniques were integrated using average rank, Borda, and Copeland methods. Based on the results, Parrotia persica, Liquidambar styraciflua, Lagerstroemia indica, Pyracantha coccinea, and Ligustrum texanum were ranked highest and Aesculus hippocastanum, Koelreuteria paniculata, Crataegus microphylla, Viburnum opulus, and Berberis gagnepainii were ranked lowest. Based on the detailed results, the assessment of trees, shrubs, and hedge plants can help decision makers and planners of urban green space development.

AB  - The current study aimed at evaluating the capabilities of seven advanced machine learning techniques (MLTs), including, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Naive Bayes (NB), for landslide susceptibility modeling and comparison of their performances. Coupling machine learning algorithms with spatial data types for landslide susceptibility mapping is a vitally important issue. This study was carried out using GIS and R open source software at Abha Basin, Asir Region, Saudi Arabia. First, a total of 243 landslide locations were identified at Abha Basin to prepare the landslide inventory map using different data sources. All the landslide areas were randomly separated into two groups with a ratio of 70% for training and 30% for validating purposes. Twelve landslide-variables were generated for landslide susceptibility modeling, which include altitude, lithology, distance to faults, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), landuse/landcover (LULC), distance to roads, slope angle, distance to streams, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope length (LS), and slope-aspect. The area under curve (AUC-ROC) approach has been applied to evaluate, validate, and compare the MLTs performance. The results indicated that AUC values for seven MLTs range from 89.0% for QDA to 95.1% for RF. Our findings showed that the RF (AUC = 95.1%) and LDA (AUC = 941.7%) have produced the best performances in comparison to other MLTs. The outcome of this study and the landslide susceptibility maps would be useful for environmental protection.

AB  - The selection of the most appropriate casting gating system design is one of the most critical decision-making tasks in foundries as it is closely associated to the amount of air inclusions and surface defect concentration, which should be minimal in the final casting product to ensure superior quality and enhanced mechanical properties. Moreover, the design of the gating system influences the material and energy usage and consequently the cost of the sand casting manufacturing process. Therefore, its design should be thoughtfully considered and planned. In this investigation, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) is being coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations in order to select the optimal gating system design with respect to the sustainability of the process. Besides process energy, three additional criteria were used for the evaluation of the gating system performance, namely: air entrainment, surface defect concentration and mould cost. CFD simulations were performed to evaluate each one of the 6 gating system designs considered against each one the aforementioned criteria. The selection of the most appropriate gating system was performed using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS).

AB  - Big data task scheduling in cloud computing environments has gained considerable attention in the past few years, due to the exponential growth in the number of businesses that are relying on cloud-based infrastructure as a backbone for big data storage and analytics. The main challenge in scheduling big data services in cloud-based environments is to guarantee minimal makespan while minimizing at the same time the amount of utilized resources. Several approaches have been proposed in an attempt to overcome this challenge. The main limitation of these approaches stems from the fact that they overlook the trust levels of the Virtual Machines (VMs), thus risking to endanger the overall Quality of Service (QoS) of the big data analytic process, which includes not only heartbeat frequency ratio and resource consumption, but also security challenges such as intrusion detection, access control, authentication, etc. To overcome this limitation, we propose in this work a trust-aware scheduling solution called BigTrustScheduling that consists of three stages: VMs’ trust level computation, tasks priority level determination, and trust-aware scheduling. Experiments conducted on a real Hadoop cluster environment using real-world datasets collected from the Google Cloud Platform pricing and Bitbrains task and resource requirements show that our solution minimizes the makespan by 59% compared to the Shortest Job First (SJF), by 48% compared to the Round Robin (RR), and by 40% compared to the improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approaches in the presence of untrusted VMs. Moreover, our solution decreases the monetary cost by 58% compared to the SJF, by 47% compared to the RR, and by 38% compared to the improved PSO in the presence of untrusted VMs. The results in this work can be applicable to other problems. This would be possible through tuning the corresponding metrics in the formulation of the problem and solution, as will as in the experimental environment. In fact, the trust model can be extended to other environments including cloud computing, IoT, parallel computing, etc.

AB  - Renewable energy utilisation, latent energy storage, optimal system design, and robust system operation are critical elements for carbon-free buildings and communities. Machine learning methods are effective to assist the energy-efficient renewable systems during multi-criteria design and multi-level uncertainty-based operation periods. However, the current literature provides little knowledge on this topic. In this study, a state-of-the-art-review on phase change materials for cooling applications is presented, in terms of smart ventilations, intelligent PCMs charging/discharging, deterministic parametrical analysis, stochastic uncertainty-based performance prediction and optimisation. Furthermore, technical effectiveness of machine learning methods in single and multi-objective optimisations has been presented, through hybrid PCMs integrated renewable systems. Multivariables involved in the review include thermo-physical, geometrical and operating parameters of PCMs. Multi-criteria employed in the review include heat transfer rate, cooling energy storage density, heat storage and release efficiency, and indoor thermal comfort. The literature review presents technical challenges, such as tradeoff solutions between computational accuracy and efficiency, generic methods for effective selection amongst multi-diversified optimal solutions along the Pareto front, the general methodology for multi-level uncertainty quantification, smart controllers with accurate predictions under high-level parameters’ uncertainty and stochastic occupants’ behaviors. The future outlook and recommendations of machine learning methods in PCMs integrated cooling systems have also been presented as avenues for upcoming research.

AB  - User-generated data enable businesses to derive competitive intelligence from the perspective of customers. With the advent of favorite data, we propose a sparse biterm-based Dirichlet process model and bipartite graph model with a random walk algorithm to analyze asymmetric competition. Through investigating the asymmetric market structure, representativeness degree of each entity, and competition network, the proposed machine learning models provide managerial insights into market competition. Based on 832,897 customers’ favorite lists, we empirically employ the proposed models to analyze the competition among the 2,204 car models in China's automotive market. Drawing on the activities of many customers in the market, our models enhance firms’ understanding of how the market is segmented by customers, which segments are most popular, and how entities compete with each other within the competition network. We can also inform managers of the segments within which a product competes, the representativeness of its competitors, and the leaders in each segment. The empirical results demonstrate that our models are practical in deriving insights about asymmetric competition for managers.

AB  - The environmental impacts of the mining industry as well as reduction strategies are important issues that have been highlighted as a result of the environmentally-friendly policy of green mining. As part of that policy, this study developed an approach based on a multi-layer artificial neural network and fuzzy cognitive map to predict the vertical and horizontal distribution of blast-induced dust emissions, simultaneously. Hence, a fuzzy cognitive map based on the cause-and-effect analysis concept was first designed to extract inputs’ weights. An optimal network with two hidden layers was then implemented to predict the vertical and horizontal dust distributions in a mine close to residential and agricultural areas. The performance evaluation of the approach indicated good results by the R2 of 0.9933 and 0.9267 between the measured and predicted values for the horizontal and vertical distributions, respectively. Furthermore, the predicted and measured outputs over every blasting round were in accordance due to the slight mean absolute and root mean square errors of 0.009 and 0.018, respectively. A sensitivity analysis revealed that all inputs, excluding air humidity on the vertical distribution, had acceptable effects on the dust distribution outputs by the strength of higher than 0.7. Based on a reduction solution that we suggested, one round was blasted by taking water capsules together with stemming material in 40% of the whole blast holes. The results indicated that the maximum horizontal distribution of blast-induced dust was decreased about six times. The approach can be straightforwardly updated and used for other mining cases.

In order to create a reliable model, only experimental data determined through model test measurements was used to train the neural network. This study showed that added wave resistance values predicted by the neural network soundly correlated with measured data and had good generalization ability. The developed neural network was presented in the form of mathematical function. This article presents examples of the use of this function to calculate added wave resistance. Functions presented here could have practical application in ship resistance analysis at the preliminary design stage.

AB  - This paper proposes a set of different alternatives of machine learning based algorithms (MLBA) – based on decision trees, neural networks and clustering techniques – to start up multiple rapid start units in AGC operation of power systems. MBLA predict at each instant if the AGC area will fulfil AGC requirements to decide whether RS units should be connected. The operation costs of the RS units (RSOC), the non-compliance time (NCT) of the control area and the non-served secondary energy of the control area (NSSE), are used as key performance indexes of each MLBA. A complete methodology is developed to choose the best algorithm to be employed by a real AGC regulating zone, comprising three steps: (a) an AGC simulation model of the regulating area to test each MLBA, (b) an optimization model to compute a reference of the ideal start-ups of the RS units under perfect information of the regulating area requirements and (c) a normalization process to monetarize NCT and NSSE. The description and tuning of the algorithms to start up multiple RS units, together with the selection and comparison methodology, will be shown for a real secondary regulation zone corresponding to an important generation company of the Spanish power system.

The proposed model considers a broad facility network linking production and distribution facilities located internationally. The proposed model discussed in the paper assumes significance over the traditional manufacturing model as it provides a country specific analysis making it more convenient for the decision maker to devise country specific strategies within an international ecosystem. Therefore, the model considers import export cost, loan subsidies along with depreciation expense and other operating costs applicable to specific country. The objective of the model is to identify optimal facility locations and the production distribution in the entire network to meet the demand of global markets. The proposed model is illustrated and computationally tested using two cases. Model parameters are mapped using 3Vs of Big Data viz. Volume, Velocity and Variety.

AB  - Small-Scale Fisheries (SSFs) globally and in Kenya face myriad constraints. However, there is little empirical information about actors' perspectives of these constraints and proposed solutions. The present study contributes to addressing this empirical gap. The study was conducted in Kenya's coast at Malindi, Mayungu, Mombasa, Shimoni and Vanga study sites. Data was collected through focus group discussions and supplemented by interviews of 403 actors (fishers, middlemen and small-scale processors). Constraints and opportunities were ranked using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) method and reported under nine broad value chain dimensions. Results showed that all actor groups ranked financial capital as the most severe constraint. Market related constraints were ranked as the second most pressing problem amongst fishers and middlemen, while processors identified scarcity of fish. Other constraints identified, were related to resource, equipment and infrastructure, training, costs, governance, trust and labour dimensions. Solutions were ranked in corresponding order of constraints, except in a few cases. These findings can assist to bridge actors' perspectives with those of managers and other value chain development agents, and thus help to define appropriate interventions.

KW  - Die casting
KW  - Deep neural networks
KW  - Multi-objective optimization
AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate the combination of machine learning and three dimensional numerical simulations for multi-objective optimization of low pressure die casting. The cooling of molten metal inside the mold is achieved typically by passing water through the cooling lines in the die. Depending on the cooling line location, coolant flow rate and die geometry, nonuniform temperatures are imposed on the molten metal at the mold wall. This boundary condition along with the initial molten metal temperature affect the product quality quantified in terms of micro-structure parameters and yield strength. A finite volume based numerical solver is used to determine the temperature-time history and correlate the inputs to outputs. The objective of this research is to develop and demonstrate a procedure to obtain the initial and wall temperatures so as to optimize the product quality. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used for multi-objective optimization in this work. The number of function evaluations required for NSGA-II can be of the order of millions and hence, the finite volume solver cannot be used directly for optimization. Therefore, a multilayer perceptron feed-forward neural network is first trained using the results from the numerical solution of the fluid flow and energy equations and is subsequently used as a surrogate model. As an assessment, simplified versions of the actual problem are designed to first verify results of the genetic algorithm. An innovative local sensitivity based approach is then used to rank the final Pareto optimal solutions and select a single best design.

AB  - This paper proposes a new design approach based on an iterative machine learning algorithm to speed up the topological design exploration of compression-only shell structures with planar faces, considering both structural performance and construction constraints. In this paper, we show that building neural networks allows one to train a surrogate model to accelerate the structural performance assessment of various possible structural forms without going through a significantly slower process of geometric form-finding. The geometric form-finding methods of 3D graphic statics are used as the primary structural design tool to generate a single-layer, compression-only shell with planar faces. Subdividing the force diagram and its polyhedral cells using various rules results in a variety of topologically different compression-only structures with different load-bearing capacities for the same boundary conditions. The solution space for all possible compression-only forms for a given boundary condition is vast, which makes iterating through all forms to find the ideal solutions practically impossible. After training with an iterative active sampling method, the surrogate model can evaluate the input data, including the subdivision rules, and predict the value of the structural performance and the construction constraints of the planar faces within milliseconds. As a result, one can then evaluate the nonlinear relations among all the subdivision rules and the chosen structural performance measures, and then, visualize the entire solution space. Consequently, multiple solutions with customized thresholds of the evaluation criteria are found that show the strength of this method of form-finding in generating design solutions. Besides, considering the total training time of the neural network model, the proposed framework is still faster than a traditional optimization method, such as the genetic algorithm that can find only the optimum values. This process will result in interactive sampling methods in which the machine learning models assist the designer in choosing and controlling different design strategies by providing real-time feedback on the effects of the selected parameters on the design outputs.

AB  - Application of super-insulating materials in building glazing system shows promising prospects for low-energy buildings. In this research, the heat transfer, solar radiation transmission and indoor illuminance of an aerogel glazing system were characterized through an experimentally validated numerical model. Contribution ratios of multi-variables to multi-objectives were thereafter quantified, following the Taguchi standard orthogonal array. In respect to the application of aerogel glazing system in subtropical climates, an energy-related contradiction between indoor illuminance from solar and indoor heat gain, has been presented, discussed, together with effective solutions. In order to minimise the total heat gain and maximise the indoor illuminance transmitted through the aerogel glazing system, a generic multi-objective optimisation methodology, with high computational efficiency and accuracy, has been developed, to identify the optimal design. The results indicate that through the Pareto front from the multi-objective optimisation results, a significant reduction of total heat gain and an obvious increase of the indoor illuminance can be noticed. Compared to the optimal case in the standard orthogonal array, with the application of the proposed multi-objective optimisation methodology, the annual total heat gain could be reduced from 489305.5 to 333396.4 Wh by 31.9% and the annual indoor illuminance could be increased from 56786.6 to 172973.5 lux by 67.2%. The year-round performance indicates that, compared to the bi-objective optimisation (annual transmitted heat gain and annual indoor illuminance) with the annual total heat gain at 333.4 kWh/m2 and annual indoor illuminance at 162.3 klux, the bi-objective optimisation (annual total heat gain and annual indoor illuminance) shows a lower annual total heat gain at 322.4 kWh/m2 by 3.4%) and a higher annual indoor illuminance at 173 klux by 6.6%. This study proposes an overall framework and technical guidance of a new multi-objective optimisation methodology, which can automatically learn mechanisms of heat transfer and solar radiation transmittance through nanoporous aerogel granules, and identify the optimal multi-variables setting for the robust system design and operation.

This paper reviews the existing DER integration models, optimization and multi-criteria decision-making approaches. Further to that, a recently developed monarch butterfly optimization method is introduced to solve the problem of DER mix in distribution systems. A new multiobjective DER integration problem is formulated to find the optimal sites, sizes and mix (dispatchable and non-dispatchable) for DERs considering multiple key performance objectives. Besides, a hybrid method that combines the monarch butterfly optimization and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is proposed to solve the formulated large-scale multi-criteria decision-making problem. Whilst the meta-heuristic optimization method generates non-dominated solutions (creating Pareto-front), the TOPSIS approach selects that with the most promising outcome from a large number of alternatives. The effectiveness of this approach is verified by solving single and multiobjective dispatchable DER integration problems over the benchmark 33-bus distribution system and the performance is compared with the existing optimization methods. The proposed model of DER mix and the optimization technique significantly improve the system performance in terms of average annual energy loss reduction by 78.36%, mean node voltage deviation improvement by 9.59% and average branches loadability limits enhancement by 50%, and minimized the power fluctuation induced by 48.39% renewable penetration. The proposed optimization techniques outperform the existing methods with promising exploration and exploitation abilities to solve engineering optimization problems.

AB  - Integrating phase change materials (PCMs) in buildings cannot only enhance the energy performance, but also improve the renewable utilization efficiency through considerable latent heat during charging/discharging cycles. However, system performances are dependent on PCMs’ integrated forms, heat transfer enhancement solutions, system operating modes, together with optimal geometrical and operating parameters. In this study, passive, active, and combined passive/active solutions in PCMs systems have been comprehensively reviewed, when being applied in heating, cooling and electrical systems, together with a dialectical analysis on advantages and disadvantages. In addition to novel system designs, interdisciplinary applications of machine learning have been reviewed and formulated, from perspectives of reliable structures, smart operational controls, and stochastic uncertainty-based performance prediction. Furthermore, a generic methodology with a systematic and hierarchical procedure has been proposed, with the implementation of machine-learning based technique for optimisations during both design and operation periods. The mechanisms of machine learning techniques were characterised as the simplifications of modelling and optimization processes, through the errors-driven update, the support vector regression and the backpropagation neural network. Several technical challenges were identified, such as the heat transfer enhancement, the novel structural configurations and the flexible switch on operating modes. Finally, identified challenges on machine learning include the development of advanced learning algorithms for efficient performance predictions, optimal structural configurations on neural networks, the trade-off between computational complexity and reliable optimal solutions, and so on. The formulated climate-adaptive designs, intelligent operations, uncertainty-based analysis and optimisations with interdisciplinary machine learning techniques can promote PCMs applications in sustainable buildings.

AB  - Recent studies in project management have shown the important role of entrepreneurship orientation of the individuals in project performance. Although identifying the role of entrepreneurship orientation as a critical success factor in project performance has been considered as an important issue, it is also important to develop a measurement system for predicting performance based on the degree of an individual's entrepreneurial orientation. In this study, we use predictive analytics by proposing a machine learning approach to predict individuals' project performance based on measures of several aspects of entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial attitude of the individuals. We investigated this relationship using a sample of 185 observations and a range of machine learning algorithms including lasso, ridge, support vector machines, neural networks, and random forest. Our results showed that the best method for predicting project performance is lasso. After identifying the best predictive model, we then used the Bayesian Information Criterion and the Akaike Information Criterion to identify the most significant factors. Our results identify all three aspects of entrepreneurial attitude (social self-efficacy, appearance self-efficacy, and comparativeness) and one aspect of entrepreneurial orientation (proactiveness) as the most important factors. This study contributes to the relationship between entrepreneurship skills and project performance and provides insights into the application of emerging tools in data science and machine learning in operations management and project management research.

AB  - For the optimization of concrete mixture proportions, multiple objectives (e.g., strength, cost, slump) with many variables (e.g., concrete components) under highly nonlinear constraints need to be optimized simultaneously. The current single-objective optimization models are not applicable to multi-objective optimization (MOO). This study proposes an MOO method based on machine learning (ML) and metaheuristic algorithms to optimize concrete mixture proportions. First, the performances of different ML models in the prediction of concrete objectives are compared on data sets collected from the published literature. The winner is selected as the objective function for the optimization procedure. In the optimization step, a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize mixture proportions to achieve optimal objectives. The results show that the backpropagation neural network has better performance on continuous data (e.g., strength), whereas the random forest algorithm has higher prediction accuracy on more discrete data (e.g., slump). The Pareto fronts of a bi-objective mixture optimization problem for high-performance concrete and a tri-objective mixture optimization problem for plastic concrete are successfully obtained by the MOO model. The MOO model can serve as a design guide to facilitate decision-making before the construction phase.

AB  - In order to address agronomic sustainability issues for the densely populated country like India tools for assessing soil quality are the prime requisite. In the present study with the fundamental goal to assess soil quality we have intended to assemble a range of soil quality indicators and validate the result with respect to a Bansloi river basin (Area-1860 km2) of eastern India. In aim to approximate soil quality, field survey data of 296 surface samples (0–20 cm) are tested in laboratory settings and 12 soil quality indicators (namely- N, P, K, pH, EC, OC, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, B, and S) are integrated into the Soil Quality Indices (SQIs). Simple additive (SQISA), PCA based (SQIPCA) and Correlation (SQIr) based weighted index methods are used for the SQI estimation. SQIs results are then co-related with major crops (Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum, Brassica juncea, Zea mays etc.) yield to verify their functional relationships. Spatial prediction and mapping of soil quality in data sparse environment is another aim of the study. In this regard Random Forest (RF) method is employed to calculate the predicted soil quality indices (PSOIs). Three error criteria (namely, R2; ME and RMSE) are used to appraise their relative credibility. PCA results show that, micro-nutrients Fe, Mn apart from N, P, K have significant control towards soil quality. Results also demonstrate that, SQIr and PSQIr are relatively more consistent in their correlation with the crops yield. Among the PSQIs, PSQIr counts the smallest error in the prediction of spatial soil quality. Overall results also confirm optimal performance of RF for SQI prediction and PSQIr is found to be the most competent tool to predict the soil quality at un-sampled locations. However, before generalizing, the authors recommend thorough validation of the PSQIr in other regions and long-term field experiments.

AB  - With the rapid developments in emerging mobile technologies, utilizing resource-hungry mobile applications such as media processing, online Gaming, Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR) play an essential role in both businesses and entertainments. To soften the burden of such complexities incurred by fast developments of such serving technologies, distributed Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been developed, aimed at bringing the computation environments near the end-users, usually in one hop, to reach predefined requirements. In the literature, offloading approaches are developed to connect the computation environments to mobile devices by transferring resource-hungry tasks to the near servers. Because of some rising problems such as inherent software and hardware heterogeneity, restrictions, dynamism, and stochastic behavior of the ecosystem, the computation offloading issues consider as the essential challenging problems in the MEC environment. However, to the best of the author's knowledge, in spite of its significance, in machine learning-based (ML-based) computation offloading mechanisms, there is not any systematic, comprehensive, and detailed survey in the MEC environment. In this paper, we provide a review on the ML-based computation offloading mechanisms in the MEC environment in the form of a classical taxonomy to identify the contemporary mechanisms on this crucial topic and to offer open issues as well. The proposed taxonomy is classified into three main fields: Reinforcement learning-based mechanisms, supervised learning-based mechanisms, and unsupervised learning-based mechanisms. Next, these classes are compared with each other based on the essential features such as performance metrics, case studies, utilized techniques, and evaluation tools, and their advantages and weaknesses are discussed, as well. Finally, open issues and uncovered or inadequately covered future research challenges are argued, and the survey is concluded.

AB  - Radiomics has great prospects in terms of tumour grading, diagnosis and prediction of prognosis by analysing multifaceted data from sources such as clinical treatments, medical images, and pathology. However, exploring an effective way to manage miscellaneous clinical information, as well as to select an appropriate classifier for prediction modelling, is still demanding in a practical clinical context. In this study, we propose a multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) based classifier fusion (MCF) strategy to combine different classifiers within an MCDM framework. A hierarchical predictive scheme (H-MCF) based on the proposed MCF is also investigated to reliably link the multi-modality features and multi-classifiers. Ten public UCI datasets and two clinical datasets were used to validate the proposed MCF and H-MCF. The experimental results showed that H-MCF has superior predictive performance when compared with the traditional fusion strategies and other fusion architectures, thus demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed H-MCF in integrating information from features of diversified modalities and different classifiers.

AB  - The processing parameters/plan decision of the machine tool can effectively realize the coordinated optimization of production efficiency, processing quality, resource consumption and environmental emissions. However, the current research has problems such as single decision-making objectives, high degree of subjective decision-making, and large error in decision-making results. Against this backdrop, our research proposes a multi-objective decision-making method for a machining process plan. Firstly, the resource consumption and environmental emissions of machining process are analyzed based on an input-process-output (IPO) model. Then, in view of the complex interplay between traditional indicators and environmental impact indicators, we propose a combination weight determined by an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) method, which considers subjective weight and objective weight. Thirdly, we set positive and negative reference sequences using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method, and the gray correlation and Euclidean distance are used for sorting each experimental group (processing parameters). Finally, an experimental case study is performed on a spindle sleeve made of GCr15, the machining type include turning, grinding, and drilling. The optimal processing parameters are determined to achieve coordinated optimization of resource consumption, processing quality, and production efficiency.

AB  - The conservation of heritage buildings is a challenging task for conservation architects, urban planners, city managers and stakeholders as it involves complex decision making. Heritage buildings are limited resource with unique values which cannot be replaced, but if they are not conserved with timely interventions, they would be lost permanently. Over the years many researchers have attempted to test the application of Multi-criteria Decision Making methods for aiding the decision-makers in deciding adaptive-reuse strategy, prioritising renovation projects, assessing building significance, evaluating alternative solutions for renovations, assessing functional service life, assessing building condition, contractor selection, suitability for tourism, budget allocations, cost estimation, etc. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of all the relevant articles from Web of Science (WoS) academic database on applications of MCDM methods in Heritage buildings. The review includes a state of the art bibliometric analysis to understand the research publication trend and trajectory, followed by a comprehensive review classifying the articles as per the application categories, identification of MCDM methods used for criteria weight determination, MCDM methods employed for ranking and methods used for validation. The review also presents the summary of common criteria applied under each application category. The opportunities available for further research in the domain are also discussed. The 42 relevant articles reviewed and summarised in this paper would provide an important reference for future decision-makers and researchers involved in developing MCDM methods based models for heritage buildings.

AB  - Freshwater shortages have become much more common globally in recent years. Water resources that are naturally available beneath the surface are capable of reversing this condition. Spatial modeling of groundwater distribution is an important undertaking that would aid in subsequent conservation and management of groundwater resources. In this study, groundwater potential maps were developed using a machine learning algorithm (MLA) and a deep learning algorithm (DLA), specifically the support vector regression (SVR) and convolution neural network (CNN) functions, respectively. Initially, 140 groundwater datasets were created through an extensive survey and then arbitrarily divided into groups of 100 (70%) and 40 (30%) datasets for model calibration and testing, respectively. Next, 15 groundwater conditioning factors (GCFs), including catchment area (CA), convergence index (CI), convexity (Co), diurnal anisotropic heating (DH), flow path (FP), slope angle (SA), slope height (SH), topographic position index (TPI), terrain ruggedness index (TRI), slope length (LS) factor, mass balance index (MBI), texture (TX), valley depth (VD), land cover (LC), and geology (GG) were produced and applied for model training. Finally, the calibrated model was validated using both training and testing data, and the independent measure of the receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC). For validation using training data, the AUC values of CNN and SVR were 0.844 and 0.75, whereas those of CNN and SVR during validation with the testing data were 0.843 and 0.75. Therefore, CNN has better predictive ability than SVR. The findings of this study will help policymakers develop better strategies for conservation and management of groundwater resources.

AB  - Data-driven methods, which can explore the relationship among battery external parameters and battery states automatically without establishing complicated battery model, have been intensively applied to estimate state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) etc. Nevertheless, relatively few researches have been done on the selection of data-driven model parameters and the determination of model with the optimal comprehensive performance. To address these questions, this paper presents a multi-objective decision method for data-driven based estimation of battery states. This method adopts the combination of the analytic hierarchy process and the entropy weight method together with integrating subjective and objective weights. The mean absolute error and root squared mean error of training-set, validation-set and test-set are used as accuracy indexes, and modeling time is seen as computation burden index. These seven indexes are applied as objective criteria for the multi-objective evaluation method, successfully evaluating the comprehensive performance of estimation model. Moreover, with three cases for RUL estimation, the specific application process of selecting the model with the optimal comprehensive performance by the proposed method is presented in detail.

AB  - Iran experiences frequent destructive floods with significant socioeconomic consequences. Quantifying the accurate impacts of such natural hazards, however, is a complicated task. The present study uses a deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) algorithm, which is among the newer and most powerful algorithms in big data sets, to develop a flood susceptibility map for Iran. A total of 2769 records were collected from flood locations across the entire country; we divided this data set into two groups using a cross-validation technique. The first group, used as a training data set, was constructed from 70% of the data set and was used for model building. The second group, used as a testing data set, was constructed from the remaining 30% of the records and used for validation. Ten flood conditioning factors, slope, altitude, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, rainfall, geology, land use, distance from roads, and distance from rivers, were identified and used in the modeling process. The area under the prediction-rate curve was used for model evaluation, with results showing that the flood susceptibility map has an acceptable accuracy of 75%. The results also indicated that approximately 12% and 3% of the country are highly and very highly susceptible to future flooding events, respectively. Moreover, 29% and 49% of Iran’s cities are located in areas with high and very high susceptibility to future flooding hazards. The most effective approaches to flood mitigation are preventing urban expansion and new construction in highly to very highly flood-prone areas as well as watershed management plans and constructing flood control structures according to the topographical characteristics of the catchment.

AB  - The use of dual probabilistic linguistic term sets (DPLTSs) to represent the use’s preferences in decision making can reflect the decision maker’s cognitive certainty and uncertainty. Additionally, the appearance of incomplete preferences is a recurring phenomenon that must be taken into account if you want to make a successful decision. This paper presents a new multi-criteria decision model based on the incomplete dual probabilistic linguistic preference relations (IDPLPRs). We first propose a step-by-step repairing method to repair the linguistic section and probabilistic section of IDPLPRs separately. The superiority is that this step-by-step method conforms to the principle of element generation. After that, the consistency index based on the distance measure between the dual probabilistic linguistic preference relations (DPLPRs) is defined to check and improve the consistency of DPLPRs. Then the weights of criteria can be obtained by information fusion. Moreover, we construct optimistic and pessimistic data envelopment analysis models under the dual probabilistic linguistic environment to do the sorting process. Optimistic and pessimistic data envelopment analysis models can demonstrate the efficiency of each decision-making unit (DMU) from the perspective of the most and least favorable. Finally, we simulate a cased of 5G industry market to help enterprises choose appropriate 5G partners by using proposed methods.

AB  - The integrated energy system (IES) has been regarded as a promising energy supply solution due to its high efficiency and low emissions. However, various IES composition schemes exhibit different performance, and decision-makers or stakeholders have experienced difficulty in selecting the most appropriate alternative. This paper aims to develop a multi-criteria decision-making method for a selection problem involving integrated energy system composition schemes in Zhejiang Province, China. As existing research has neglected the interaction between criteria and ignored the subjective risk attitude, this paper proposes a new method based on modified fuzzy integral and prospect theory. First, the criteria’s weights are calculated by the Mahalanobis-Taguchi Gram-Schmidt method; the λ fuzzy measures of these criteria are then calculated based on the φs transformation function and weights. This approach not only considers both subjective and objective information, but also eliminates overlapping information between criteria. Second, based on the grey correlation degree and the prospect theory, a prospect decision matrix is obtained that considers decision-makers’ subjective risk attitudes. Finally, the alternatives are scored using a fuzzy integral. The results reveal that a complimentary solar and wind based system is the preferred scheme in project construction. Further, comparison and sensitivity analyses verify the proposed model’s validity and feasibility, and some suggestions are given to further develop the IES.

AB  - Over the past decades, building manufacturing has caused serious environmental impacts, despite its role in the national economic growth. Thus, in developing strategic plans for economic growth, many governments consider the application of green manufacturing building and technologies as key factors towards a greener economy and lower carbon emission. However, so far, there have been limited efforts relating to the application of eco-efficiency ideas in building manufacturing. In fact, environmental sustainability in building project and delivery is still at a nascent stage. Thus, this study aims to identify and rank the sustainability indicators for assessing green building manufacturing in Malaysia by considering Green Building Index (GBI), which is the most applied sustainability rating tool in the country. Data is collected from a panel of experts and fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is performed to reveal the importance level and relationships among sustainability indicators in green building manufacturing. Results show that “Energy Efficiency” and “Indoor Environmental Quality” are the most important, while “Water Efficiency” and “Innovation” are the least important criteria in assessing green building manufacturing in Malaysia. This study can serve as a guideline to select and promote the optimum practices in green building manufacturing.

AB  - Integrating advanced materials in building glazing systems is critical for promoting net-zero energy buildings. In this research, both experimental and numerical studies were conducted on an aerogel glazing system. In order to provide climate adaptive designs on the aerogel glazing system with optimal geometric and operating parameters, a generic optimization methodology was developed by flexibly integrating supervised machine learning and advanced teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm. The proposed optimization methodology was thereafter used for optimal system designs in different climate regions. Results indicate that the proposed surrogate model can intelligently and accurately learn and update the optimization function with straightforward mathematical associations between multivariables and objectives. In addition, within optimal cases, total heat gain and heat flux are dominated by the extinction coefficient in southern cities, whereas the total heat gain is dominated by the thermal conductivity in the northern city, LanZhou. By adopting the proposed technique in this study, compared to optimal results following the Taguchi standard orthogonal array, the total heat gain can be reduced by 62.5% to 36.27 kWh/m2 in LanZhou, and by 5.9% to 267.18 kWh/m2 in GuangZhou, respectively. This study formulates a general methodology for climate adaptive optimal designs on aerogel glazing systems in different climatic regions.

AB  - The new product development (NPD) is crucial to firms’ survival and success. Tough decisions must be made between the binary NPD strategy (i.e. incremental NPD strategy and radical NPD strategy) to ensure that scarce resources are allocated efficiently. The inappropriate NPD strategy that does not meet the internal and external conditions may lead to resources waste and performance decline. The binary NPD strategy forecasting is helpful to guide the firms when to improve existing products and when to develop ‘really new’ products. Therefore, the primary purposes of this study are to construct an evaluating indicator system and to find the appropriate method for the binary NPD strategy forecasting. Here we obtain 1088 valid sample datasets from Chinese automotive industry, covering the period 2001–2014. The empirical results indicate that RS-MultiBoosting as a kind of hybrid ensemble machine learning (HEML) method demonstrate an outstanding forecasting performance in dealing with the small datasets by comparison with the other four ensemble machine learning (EML) methods and three individual machine learning (IML) methods. The findings can help firms to make the right business decision between incremental and radical NPD strategies so that they can avoid resources waste and improve the overall NPD performance.

AB  - Catastrophic natural hazards, such as earthquake, pose serious threats to properties and human lives in urban areas. Therefore, earthquake risk assessment (ERA) is indispensable in disaster management. ERA is an integration of the extent of probability and vulnerability of assets. This study develops an integrated model by using the artificial neural network–analytic hierarchy process (ANN–AHP) model for constructing the ERA map. The aim of the study is to quantify urban population risk that may be caused by impending earthquakes. The model is applied to the city of Banda Aceh in Indonesia, a seismically active zone of Aceh province frequently affected by devastating earthquakes. ANN is used for probability mapping, whereas AHP is used to assess urban vulnerability after the hazard map is created with the aid of earthquake intensity variation thematic layering. The risk map is subsequently created by combining the probability, hazard, and vulnerability maps. Then, the risk levels of various zones are obtained. The validation process reveals that the proposed model can map the earthquake probability based on historical events with an accuracy of 84%. Furthermore, results show that the central and southeastern regions of the city have moderate to very high risk classifications, whereas the other parts of the city fall under low to very low earthquake risk classifications. The findings of this research are useful for government agencies and decision makers, particularly in estimating risk dimensions in urban areas and for the future studies to project the preparedness strategies for Banda Aceh.

AB  - Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods have become increasingly popular in site selection decision-making of renewable energy power plants because they consider multiple conflicting goals and decision-maker preferences. In this paper, a systematic literature review of MCDM applications for renewable energy site selection is performed, covering a total of 85 papers published from 2001 to 2018 in high-level journals (chosen from the ScienceDirect database). This paper has summarized the exclusion criteria and evaluation criteria of site selection for five energy sources. The five site selection stages, criteria selection, data normalization, criteria weighting, alternative evaluation and result validation, are revealed by content analysis. All papers are further classified by the date, energy source, journal of publication, country of author affiliation, and study area. It is found that different energy sources emphasize different criteria; however, some similarities exist. Literature surveys and expert opinions are most common criteria selection method. Reclassification is most frequently used data normalization method. The analytic hierarchy process is popular for weighting. In alternative evaluation, geographic information systems and weighted linear combination are the most popular tools. Varying the criteria weights is most commonly used result validation method.

AB  - Floods are one of the most widespread natural hazards occurring across the globe. The main objective of this study was to produce flood susceptibility maps for the province of Salzburg, Austria, using two multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) models including analytical hierarchical process (AHP) and analytical network process (ANP) and two machine learning (ML) models including random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). Additionally, we compare which of the MCDA and ML models are better suited for flood susceptibility and evaluate the use of Dempster Shafer Theory (DST) for optimising the resulting flood susceptibility maps based on eleven flood conditioning factors: elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), geology, rainfall, land cover, distance to roads and distance to drainage. The accuracy evaluation of the flood susceptibility maps through the AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) method along with the relative flood density (R-Index) shows that RF (AUC = 87.8%) and SVM (AUC = 87%) outperform the ANP (AUC = 86.6%) and AHP (AUC = 85.9%) models. Therefore, the predictive performance of ML models was slightly better than the MCDA models. The DST could further increase the accuracy of both ML models (AUC = 88.3%) and MCDA models (AUC = 87.3%). However, the best accuracy (AUC = 89.3%) is reached through an ensemble of all four models.

AB  - This study explores the interdependence of big data analytics (BDA) capabilities and the impact of these capabilities on firm performance using an integrated multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology. Drawing on a rich data set obtained from selected case study firms in Pakistan, three MCDM tools, namely, intuitionistic fuzzy decision-making trial and evolution laboratory (IF-DEMATEL), analytic network process (ANP), and simple additive weighting (SAW), are employed to assess the relative importance of BDA capabilities and the relationship of these capabilities with the firm performance. The results show that BDA capabilities are interdependent, and infrastructure capabilities are the highest-ranked among all, followed by management and human resource capabilities, respectively. The SAW results indicate an association between BDA capabilities and firm performance. Moreover, BDA capabilities are more strongly related to operational performance than to market performance.

AB  - Due to the potential severity of oil and gas pipeline accidents, accurate assessments on the reliability and viability of pipelines in the petroleum industry is of paramount importance. Nevertheless, the safety factor (SF) parameter in some well-established assessment standards are limited in their applications. This paper proposes a modified method for the SF parameter to better assess petroleum pipeline reliability. The proposed method improves upon current methods in that the SF is derived from multiple critical factors based on pipeline big data rather than the calculation of only the pressure of the pipeline. Data from an in-service pipeline is used as a case study to demonstrate how the proposed modified SF parameter is calculated. Comparative analysis with the existing method's results provide clear evidence that the proposed modification method is more accurate as it shows how the SF parameter changes according to different regional levels. This modified method, which incorporates Correlation Analysis, Mutual Information Principal Component Analysis (MIPCA), and Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS), is in accordance with the widely accepted American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Manual for Determining the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipelines (B31G-2012). With that said, the effectiveness of our modified method is directly related to the factors and case-based values being used. Therefore, although generally applicable to any pipeline, any form of SF analytics must be on a case-by-case basis.

In this study, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) with Entropy Weighted method is applied to select the optimal technology among the waste -to -energy technological options using the waste stream of Lagos, Nigeria. The results presented show that anaerobic digestion has been the best waste to energy technology solution for electricity generation in Lagos, followed by pyrolysis while incineration is seen as the worst preferred option of choice for energy generation applicability in standalone model. In order to maximally extract energy from waste in a sustainable, economical, and environmentally friendly manner, an integrated application of waste-to-energy technologies is also explored. It is found that the hybrid of anaerobic digestion, landfill gas recovery and pyrolysis give the most favourable results in terms of environmental benefits and electricity generation potential. It is also revealed that incineration technology either in the standalone or in the hybrid form is completely discouraged from being implemented in Lagos basically due to its high investment, operation and maintenance costs as well as its discouraging environmental image. Although, the case study in this paper is that of Lagos, Nigeria but the methodology presented could be used for any cosmopolitan city around the world.

AB  - Many advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning are based on decision making, especially in uncertain settings. Due to its possible applications, decision making is currently a broad field of study in many areas like Computation, Economics and Business Management. The first techniques appeared in scenarios where information was modeled by real numbers. In all cases, one of the key steps in such processes was the summarization of the available information into a few values that helped the decision maker to complete this task. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-criteria decision making methodology in the fuzzy context in which weights and experts’ opinions (may be translated by linguistic labels) are stated as triangular fuzzy numbers. To do that, we take advantage of a recently presented fuzzy binary relation whose properties are according to human intuition and we carry out a study of the main properties that an aggregation function (a mapping to sum up information) must satisfy in the fuzzy framework. The presented procedure makes a final decision based on parabolic fuzzy numbers (not triangular). And this will be shown in an illustrative example.

AB  - Papermaking is a capital-intensive industry that requires a high consumption of plant fibers, energy, and water. Previous sustainability assessments of papermaking industry primarily focused on separate evaluations for multiple criteria without the integration for criteria and could not compare the overall priority of the production alternatives. The life cycle sustainability for the most representative boxboard production is analyzed as a case study in this work. Life cycle water consumption, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and internal costs are selected as the assessment criteria. The two multi-criteria decision-making methods are applied to integrate the above criteria to obtain the sustainability sequence under different production pathways. When the papermaking enterprises are regarded as decision-makers, the alternative using waste paper as raw material to manufacture boxboard is the most sustainable, following by mixed fiber. The sustainability sequence of the alternatives using wood and straw as raw materials is controversial due to the different calculation models. Changing the proportion of raw materials and the criteria weights might adjust sustainability sequence of the alternatives.

AB  - This paper introduces a new deep-learning algorithm of deep belief network (DBN) based on an extreme learning machine (ELM) that is structured by back propagation (BN) and optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, named DEBP, for flood susceptibility mapping in the Vu Gia-Thu Bon watershed, central Vietnam. We use 847 locations of floods that occurred in 2007, 2009, and 2013 and 16 flood conditioning factors evaluated by an information gain ratio (IGR) technique to construct and validate the proposed model. Statistical metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-measure, Jaccard coefficient, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), are used to assess the goodness-of-fit/performance and prediction accuracy of the new deep learning model. We further compare the proposed model with several well-known machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural network-based radial base function (ANNRBF), logistic regression (LR), logistic model tree (LMTree), functional tree (FTree), and alternating decision tree (ADTree). The new proposed model, DEBP, has the highest goodness-of-fit (AUC = 0.970) and prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.967) of all of the tested models and thus shows promise as a tool for flood susceptibility modeling. We conclude that novel deep learning algorithms such as the one used in this study can improve the accuracy of flood susceptibility maps that are required by planners, decision makers, and government agencies to manage of areas vulnerable to flood-induced damage.

AB  - Wind energy installation numbers have witnessed a sharp increase in the recent past. Additionally, wind farms are seen as an effective and potent part of the interconnected power system. Significant variations in the wind speed pose a challenge for wind farm operators to provide accurate forecasts. In this manuscript, three hybrid wind farms, each comprising of wind turbines and battery energy storage systems, are located in the vicinity of each other and are assumed to deliver power to a utility grid. Fuzzy-based Multi-criteria decision-making techniques are applied to this cluster of three hybrid wind farms to determine the best strategy. Machine learning-based LSSVR method is utilized for wind speed forecasting and penalty cost estimation. Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy COPRAS evaluated and potential reversal of rankings is also explored. With a cumulative priority score of 0.4573 and 99.3 for dataset X1, both, fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy COPRAS respectively indicate that A3, that is, paying penalty for power borrowed from a neighboring wind farm is the best alternative for a hybrid wind farm. This study gives new insights into decision-making, specifically for hybrid wind farms.

AB  - Objective
To use Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to determine weights for eleven criteria in order to prioritize COVID-19 non-critical patients for admission to hospital in healthcare settings with limited resources.
Methods
The MCDA was applied in two main steps: specification of criteria for prioritizing COVID-19 patients (and levels within each criterion); and determination of weights for the criteria based on experts’ knowledge and experience in managing COVID-19 patients, via an online survey. Criteria were selected based on available COVID-19 evidence with a focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Results
The most important criteria (mean weights, summing to 100%) are: PaO2 (16.3%); peripheral O2 saturation (15.9%); chest X-ray (14.1%); Modified Early Warning Score-MEWS (11.4%); respiratory rate (9.5%); comorbidities (6.5%); living with vulnerable people (6.4%); body mass index (5.6%); duration of symptoms before hospital evaluation (5.4%); CRP (5.1%); and age (3.8%).
Conclusions
At the beginning of a new pandemic, when evidence for disease predictors is limited or unavailable and effective national contingency plans are difficult to establish, the MCDA prioritization model could play a pivotal role in improving the response of health systems.

AB  - Facility Layout Design (FLP) is an NP-Hard, which is related to the optimization of the arrangement of facilities in a shop floor or manufacturing unit to maximize the performance and minimize the operating cost. An efficient layout must not only consider the profit but also emphasize on other social causes such as energy consumption, pollution, and people's safety. These are referred to as the three pillars of sustainability. This paper identifies the criteria for sustainability in a manufacturing layout and presents an aggregate mathematical formulation for Sustainable Facility Layout Problem (SFLP). The paper proposes a novel 4-stage methodology using Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Hybrid Meta-heuristic, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and K-mean clustering for designing an energy-efficient sustainable sub-optimal layout under uncertain (stochastic) demand over multiple periods. The goal of this framework is to 1) uniquely rank and predict an efficient SFLP that overcomes the dimensionality curse associated with handling large data set, 2) use K-mean to identify the criteria that maximally satisfied an efficient sustainable layout and propose an SFLP model that can be customized depending social, political and economic conditions, and 3) evaluate the total energy consumption and CO2 emission for an efficient sustainable facility layout. To show the running methodology a case is presented using hypothetical data from the literature.

AB  - Flash-floods are increasingly recognized as a frequent natural hazard worldwide. Iran has been among the mostdevastated regions affected by the major floods. While the temporal flash-flood forecasting models are mainly developed for warning systems, the models for assessing hazardous areas can greatly contribute to adaptation and mitigation policy-making and disaster risk reduction. Former researches in the flash-flood hazard mapping have heightened the urge for the advancement of more accurate models. Thus, the current research proposes the state-of-the-art ensemble models of boosted generalized linear model (GLMBoost) and random forest (RF), and Bayesian generalized linear model (BayesGLM) methods for higher performance modeling. Furthermore, a pre-processing method, namely simulated annealing (SA), is used to eliminate redundant variables from the modeling process. Results of the modeling based on the hit and miss analysis indicates high performance for both models (accuracy = 90–92%, Kappa = 79–84%, Success ratio = 94–96%, Threat score = 80–84%, and Heidke skill score = 79–84%). The variables of distance from the stream, vegetation, drainage density, land use, and elevation have shown more contribution among others for modeling the flash-flood. The results of this study can significantly facilitate mapping the hazardous areas and further assist watershed managers to control and remediate induced damages of flood in the data-scarce regions.

AB  - The integration of photovoltaic (PV) power generation system and electric vehicle (EV) charging station can effectively promote the local consumption of renewable energy and reduce the indirect carbon emissions of EV. This paper aims to provide a practical model for location decision of PV charging station (PVCS) which combines geographic information system (GIS) with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods. To verify the feasibility and practicality, an empirical study was conducted in Beijing. First, seven suitable areas were selected preliminarily by suitability analysis of GIS. This stage focused on traffic flow and road distribution. Second, MCDM methods were used to further evaluation. At this stage, a comprehensive evaluation index system of natural, economic, technical and social criteria was established. Interval number, triangular fuzzy number and hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set were utilized to collect and describe evaluation information. Then, the subjective and objective weights of the criteria were calculated by best-worst method and mixed information entropy method, respectively. Finally, the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and MCDM) method was used to rank the alternatives. The ranking results illustrated that alternative sites A3 and A7 are outstanding. Moreover, dual sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis proved the stability and reliability of the model. Scenario analysis expanded the application scope of TODIM method, which also showed that it is necessary to express decision preferences by setting different recession coefficients. This study can provide support for the layout of PVCS in urban, and enrich the application fields of GIS and MCDM methods.

The design optimization study is conducted for cross-ply layups [0s/90t/0u], [0s/90t/0u]s, [0s/90t]s and [90s/0t]s considering three uni-directional composites, i.e. Carbon/Epoxy, Glass/Epoxy, and Boron/Epoxy. The optimization study is performed by coupling a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) and Analytical Analysis. Minimizing the buoyancy factor and maximizing the buckling load factor are considered as the objectives of the optimization study. The objectives of the optimization are achieved under constraints on the Tsai-Wu, Tsai-Hill and Maximum Stress composite failure criteria and on buckling load factor. To verify the optimization approach, optimization of one particular layup configuration is also conducted in ANSYS with the same objectives and constraints.

AB  - Recent years have seen an increasing interest in Demand Response (DR) as a means to provide flexibility, and hence improve the reliability of energy systems in a cost-effective way. Yet, the high complexity of the tasks associated with DR, combined with their use of large-scale data and the frequent need for near real-time decisions, means that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) — a branch of AI — have recently emerged as key technologies for enabling demand-side response. AI methods can be used to tackle various challenges, ranging from selecting the optimal set of consumers to respond, learning their attributes and preferences, dynamic pricing, scheduling and control of devices, learning how to incentivise participants in the DR schemes and how to reward them in a fair and economically efficient way. This work provides an overview of AI methods utilised for DR applications, based on a systematic review of over 160 papers, 40 companies and commercial initiatives, and 21 large-scale projects. The papers are classified with regards to both the AI/ML algorithm(s) used and the application area in energy DR. Next, commercial initiatives are presented (including both start-ups and established companies) and large-scale innovation projects, where AI methods have been used for energy DR. The paper concludes with a discussion of advantages and potential limitations of reviewed AI techniques for different DR tasks, and outlines directions for future research in this fast-growing area.

AB  - To plan attended home deliveries efficiently and profitably, dynamic slotting can tailor the set of time slots offered to the customer. While most existing approaches focus on short-term criteria like revenue, marketing research highlights additional business objectives. For instance, distributing deliveries evenly across the region can ensure the visibility of branded trucks. Alternatively, prioritising influential customers can entice them to recommend the service to others. To accommodate additional objectives, we propose a multi-criteria approach that allocates delivery capacity to time slots and areas in two steps: First, considering spatial information on potential future customers and their values, it computes a predictive routing; second, it solves a revenue management problem to identify the most relevant customers given the set of slotting criteria. A comprehensive computational study demonstrates the effects for three exemplary criteria: revenue, visibility, and social influence. The results show that, depending on the demand scenario, additional criteria can be accommodated at little cost to revenue. However, the interaction of routing effects and offer set optimisation can cause unexpected shifts when changing the weight of criteria in the objective function. Hence, we propose a simulation-based process to let decision makers evaluate the effects of multi-criteria constellations.

AB  - Commonly used data-driven models for landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) can be mainly classified as heuristic, general statistical or machine learning models. This study plans to compare the prediction performance of these data-driven models on the landslide susceptibility mapping, thus further to explore the inherently features of these data-driven models. As a result, a more accurate and reliable LSP can be realized through choosing an optimal data-based model. A heuristic model represented by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a general statistical model represented by the general linear model (GLM) and information value (IV) model, and machine learning models represented by binary logistic regression (BLR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM) and C5.0 decision tree (C5.0 DT) are adopted in this study. Shicheng County in China is used as the study area. In total, 369 landslides identified through field investigation are classified as training (70%) and testing datasets (30%). Next, 13 landslide conditioning factors (elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, relief amplitude, total surface radiation, population density, Normalized difference vegetation index, distance to river, topographic wetness index and rock types) are acquired from data sources of the free remote sensing images, Digital Elevation Model, field investigation and government reports. The correlations between these conditioning factors and the landslide locations are determined by frequency ratio analysis. Then, the landslide susceptibility indexes (LSIs) calculated by the eight trained models are imported into GIS software to produce landslide susceptibility maps of Shicheng County. Finally, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), the calculated LSIs are applied to assess the LSP performance of the present eight models. The testing results show that these eight models generate reasonable LSP results as a whole, further showing that the C5.0 DT is of the highest prediction accuracy with an AUC value of 0.868, followed by the SVM (0.813), BPNN (0.803), MLP (0.792), BLR (0.784), GLM (0.779), IV (0.774) and AHP (0.773). It can be inferred that the machine learning models have higher LSP performance than general statistical and heuristic models due to its high AUC accuracy and reasonable LSIs distribution features, while general statistical model is limited by its linear analysis and heuristic model is limited by subjective weighting process.

AB  - Agricultural policymakers use various types of expert systems to identify agricultural problems and to explore their potential solutions. However, in the current scenario, there is no robust system that can be used to collect and analyze information regarding the problems faced by farmers of the developing countries on a large scale. This article outlines the possible mechanisms through which information and communication technology (ICT) with the use of Knowledge Discovery in Databases could facilitate agricultural adoption. The goal of this study is to explore data from a farmers’ helpline center as a new medium to gain hidden insights in terms of association rules regarding the problems faced by Indian farmers. The dataset used in this study is collected from the “Kisan Call Center”, a farmers’ helpline center managed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India. For this objective, we propose a new approach that uses association rule mining integrated with a multi-criteria decision-making technique, TOPSIS to extract only the most relevant patterns from the dataset. Later, we perform experiments in order to analyze the output of the proposed framework and verify the discovered knowledge against the validation data. The best experiment generates a rule-set, consisting of 702 association rules, including insights from 25 states of India, with an average confidence value of 73.21% on the validation data. The extracted inference reveals many hidden patterns regarding associations among the farmers’ issues from the remote states of India. Finally, we identify various potential applications of our work and conclude with some possible future developments in the proposed approach.

AB  - One of the essential problems in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is ranking a set of alternatives based on a set of criteria. In this regard, there exist several MCDM methods which rank the alternatives in different ways. As such, it would be worthwhile to try and arrive at a consensus on this important subject. In this paper, a new approach is proposed based on the half-quadratic (HQ) theory. The proposed approach determines an optimal weight for each of the MCDM ranking methods, which are used to compute the aggregated final ranking. The weight of each ranking method is obtained via a minimizer function that is inspired by the HQ theory, which automatically fulfills the basic constraints of weights in MCDM. The proposed framework also provides a consensus index and a trust level for the aggregated ranking. To illustrate the proposed approach, the evaluation and comparison of ontology alignment systems are modeled as an MCDM problem and the proposed framework is applied to the ontology alignment evaluation initiative (OAEI) 2018, for which the ranking of participating systems is of the utmost importance.

AB  - The prerequisite for earthquake risk estimation is vulnerability assessment. Therefore, estimating vulnerability is necessary to reduce future fatalities. This study aims to evaluate the earthquake vulnerability assessment (EVA) in Banda Aceh by using the multi-criteria decision-making approach through an analytical hierarchy process and VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje method using a geographical information system. Banda Aceh City is located close to the Great Sumatran Fault in North Sumatra. Several factors were used to produce social vulnerability, structural vulnerability, and geotechnical vulnerability indices. Subsequently, the adopted approaches were integrated and applied to estimate the criteria weight, priority ranking, and alternatives of criterion by applying the pair-wise comparison at all levels. Finally, vulnerability layers were superimposed to estimate the earthquake vulnerability index and produce the vulnerability map. Results showed that the central part of the city exhibits high to very high vulnerability. A tiny part of the northern–central part is under severe vulnerability conditions. The consistency ratios for all three vulnerability layers were 1.9%, 4.6% and 5.5%. The consistency ratios for the final EVA was 1.9%. The developed map revealed that 3.39% of Banda Aceh City falls under very high, 11.86% high, 23.73% medium, 28.82% low, and 32.20% of very low vulnerability areas. The proposed method for the EVA provides useful information that could assist in earthquake disaster mitigation.

AB  - Groundwater recharge is indispensable for the sustainable management of freshwater resources, especially in the arid regions. Here we address some of the important aspects of groundwater recharge through machine learning algorithms (MLAs). Three MLAs including, SVM, MARS, and RF were validated for higher prediction accuracies in generating groundwater recharge potential maps (GRPMs). Accordingly, soil permeability samples were prepared and are arbitrarily grouped into training (70%) and validation (30%) samples. The GRPMs are generated using sixteen effective factors, such as elevation (denoted using a digital elevation model; DEM), aspect, slope angle, TWI (topographic wetness index), fault density, MRVBF (multiresolution index of valley bottom flatness), rainfall, lithology, land use, drainage density, distance from rivers, distance from faults, annual ETP (evapo-transpiration), minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and rainfall 24-hr. Subsequently, the VI (variables importance) is assessed based on the LASSO algorithm. The GRPMs of three MLAs were validated using the ROC-AUC (receiver operating characteristic-area under curve) and various techniques including true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), F-measures, fallout, sensitivity, specificity, true skill statistics (TSS), and corrected classified instances (CCI). Based on the validation, the RF algorithm performed better (AUC = 0.987) than the SVM (AUC = 0.963) and the MARS algorithm (AUC = 0.962). Furthermore, the accuracy of these MLAs are included in excellent class, based on the ROC curve threshold. Our case study shows that the GRPMs are potential guidelines for decision-makers in drafting policies related to the sustainable management of the groundwater resources.

AB  - This paper is motivated by decommissioning studies in the field of oil and gas, which comprise a very large number of installations and are of interest to a large number of stakeholders. Generally, the problem gives rise to complicated multi-criteria decision aid tools that rely upon the costly evaluation of multiple criteria for every piece of equipment. We propose the use of machine learning techniques to reduce the number of criteria by feature selection, thereby reducing the number of required evaluations and producing a simplified decision aid tool with no sacrifice in performance. In addition, we also propose the use of machine learning to explore the patterns of the multi-criteria decision aid tool in a training set. Hence, we predict the outcome of the analysis for the remaining pieces of equipment, effectively replacing the multi-criteria analysis by the computational intelligence acquired from running it in the training set. Computational experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Disaster management operations are information intensive activities due to high uncertainty and complex information needs. Emergency response planners need to effectively plan response activities with limited resources and assign rescue teams to specific disaster sites with high probability of survivors swiftly. Decision making becomes tougher since the limited information available is heterogenous, untimely and often fragmented. We address the problem of lack of insightful information of the disaster sites by utilizing image data obtained from smart infrastructures. We collect geo-tagged images from earthquake-hit regions and apply deep learning method for classification of these images to identify survivors in debris. We find that deep learning method is able to classify the images with significantly higher accuracy than the conventionally used machine learning methods for image classification and utilizes significantly lesser time and computational resources. The novel application of image analytics and the resultant findings from our models have valuable implications for effective disaster response operations, especially in smart urban settlements.

AB  - Considering the unexpected emergence of natural and man-made disasters over the world and Turkey, the importance of preparedness of hospitals, which are the first reference points for people to get healthcare services, becomes clear. Determining the level of disaster preparedness of hospitals is an important and necessary issue. This is because identifying hospitals with low level of preparedness is crucial for disaster preparedness planning. In this study, a hybrid fuzzy decision making model was proposed to evaluate the disaster preparedness of hospitals. This model was developed using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP)-fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL)-technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS) techniques and aimed to determine a ranking for hospital disaster preparedness. FAHP is used to determine weights of six main criteria (including hospital buildings, equipment, communication, transportation, personnel, flexibility) and a total of thirty-six sub-criteria regarding disaster preparedness. At the same time, FDEMATEL is applied to uncover the interdependence between criteria and sub-criteria. Finally, TOPSIS is used to obtain ranking of hospitals. To provide inputs for TOPSIS implementation, some key performance indicators are established and related data is gathered by the aid of experts from the assessed hospitals. A case study considering 4 hospitals from the Turkish healthcare sector was used to demonstrate the proposed approach. The results evidenced that Personnel is the most important factor (global weight = 0.280) when evaluating the hospital preparedness while Flexibility has the greatest prominence (c + r = 23.09).

AB  - On 28th September 2018, a very high magnitude of earthquake Mw 7.5 struck the Palu city in the Island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. The main objective of this research is to estimate the earthquake risk based on probability and hazard in Palu region using cross-correlation among the derived parameters, Silhouette clustering (SC), pure locational clustering (PLC) based on hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), convolutional neural network (CNN) and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) techniques. There is no specific or simple way of identifying risks as the definition of risk varies with time and space. The main aim of this study is: i) to conduct the clustering analysis to identify the earthquake-prone areas, ii) to develop a CNN model for probability estimation, and iii) to estimate and compare the risk using two calculation equations (Risk A and B). Owing to its high prediction ability, the CNN model assessed the probability while SC and PLC were implemented to understand the spatial clustering, Euclidean distance among clusters, spatial relationship and cross-correlation among the estimated Mw, PGA and intensity including events depth. Finally, AHP was implemented for the vulnerability assessment. To this end, earthquake probability assessment (EPA), susceptibility to seismic amplification (SSA) and earthquake vulnerability assessment (EVA) results were employed to generate risk A, while earthquake hazard assessment (EHA), SSA and EVA were used to generate risk B. The risk maps were compared and the differences in results were obtained. This research concludes that in the case of earthquake risk assessment (ERA), results obtained in Risk B are better than the risk A. This study achieved 89.47% accuracy for EPA while for EVA a consistency ratio of 0.07. These results have important implications for future large-scale risk assessment, land use planning and hazard mitigation.

AB  - Floods are one of the most devastating natural events that lead to enormous and recurring loss of life, properties, and resources around the globe. In India, floods remain a major hazard during the monsoon season in many parts of the country but most seriously in the flat and monotonous Gangetic plains in the Himalayan foreland. One of the most flood-prone rivers in India is the Kosi in north Bihar, eastern India, which also forms the largest active megafan in the world. The Kosi River is known as the “sorrow of Bihar” because of its anomalous behavior and the damage it causes due to frequent floods in this region. This study evaluates the flood hazard and flood vulnerability as separate entities and combines them to assess the flood risk in the Kosi megafan region. Geomorphological, hydrological, and socio-economic data have been integrated in a GIS framework using a multi-criteria decision tool called the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to generate a process-based flood risk map for 105 blocks (administrative units) of both Nepal and India (Bihar). Such maps should encourage soft engineering solutions for flood mitigation aimed at minimizing the consequences of flooding and reducing flood risks. This study has significant implications for developing measures and plans that will help government and relief agencies in the identification of flood-prone areas and for planning emergency management strategies in this region.

KW  - Mobile service robots
KW  - Markov decision processes
KW  - Multi-objective reasoning
KW  - Long term autonomy
AB  - The daily working hours of mobile robots are limited primarily by battery life. Most systems use a combination of thresholds and fixed periods to decide when to charge. This produces charging behaviour that ignores high-value tasks that must be performed within time-windows or by deadlines. Instead the robot should schedule charging adaptively, taking into account the times of day when it is expected to be given more valuable tasks to perform. This paper proposes an approach that exploits the fact that, during long-term deployments, the robot can learn when it is most probable that valuable tasks are added to the system, enabling it to schedule charging at times that are expected to be less busy. We pose the problem of scheduling battery charging as a multi-objective sequential decision making problem over a time-dependent Markov decision process model of expected task rewards and battery dynamics. We evaluate the scalability and solution quality of our multi-objective scheduler, and compare it with a typical rule-based approach. Empirical results show that our approach enables more flexible and efficient robot behaviour, which takes into account both the value of current available tasks and the predicted value of future tasks to decide whether to charge at a given time.

AB  - Sustainability of food consumption requires the understanding of multi-dimensional environmental, economic and social impacts using a holistic and integrated sustainability assessment and modeling framework. This article presents a novel method on the assessment and modeling of sustainability impacts of food consumption. First, sustainability impacts of food consumption categories are quantified using high sector resolution input-output tables of U.S. economy. Later, an integrated sustainability modeling framework based on two supervised machine-learning techniques such as k-means clustering and logistics regression is presented. The proposed framework involves five steps: (1) economic input-output life cycle sustainability assessment, (2) non-dimensional normalization, (3) sustainability performance evaluation, (4) centroid-based clustering analysis, and (5) sustainability impact modeling. The findings show that the supply chains of food production sectors are accounted for major environmental impacts with higher than 80% of portions for total carbon footprints. Animal slaughtering, rendering, and processing is found as the most dominant sector in most of the environmental impact categories. The logistic model results revealed an overall model accuracy equal to 91.67%. Furthermore, among all the environmental sustainability indicators, it has found that CO and SO2 are the most significant contributors. The results also show that 13.7% of the food and beverage sectors are clustered as high, in which the bread and bakery product manufacturing is the central sector. The large value of the variance (5.24) is attributed to the large total weighted impact value of the animal (except poultry) slaughtering, rendering, and processing cluster.

AB  - Hazards and disasters have always negative impacts on the way of life. Landslide is an overwhelming natural as well as man-made disaster that causes loss of natural resources and human properties throughout the world. The present study aimed to assess and compare the prediction efficiency of different models in landslide susceptibility in the Kysuca river basin, Slovakia. In this regard, the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory combining with the analytic network process (FDEMATEL-ANP), Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, and random forest (RF) classifier were considered. Initially, a landslide inventory map was produced with 2000 landslide and non-landslide points by randomly divided with a ratio of 70%:30% for training and testing respectively. The geospatial database for assessing the landslide susceptibility was generated with the help of 16 landslide conditioning factors by allowing for topographical, hydrological, lithological, and land cover factors. The ReliefF method was considered for determining the significance of selected conditioning factors and inclusion in the model building. Consequently, the landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) were generated using the FDEMATEL-ANP, Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, and random forest (RF) classifier models. Finally, the area under curve (AUC) and different arithmetic evaluation were used for validating and comparing the results and models. The results revealed that random forest (RF) classifier is a promising and optimum model for landslide susceptibility in the study area with a very high value of area under curve (AUC = 0.954), lower value of mean absolute error (MAE = 0.1238) and root mean square error (RMSE = 0.2555), and higher value of Kappa index (K = 0.8435) and overall accuracy (OAC = 92.2%).

AB  - One of the most primary issues that organizations have to deal with is incorporating massive structured data problems, simultaneously. Additionally, a vital division in any organization is the department of human resources (HR), which is in charge of the recruitment and personnel selection procedures. Due to the nature of the personnel assessment problems, which include multiple candidates as alternatives along with various complex evaluating criteria, these types of problems can be tackled by the aid of multi-attribute decision making (MADM) techniques. Moreover, in mega-structured organizations, the procedure of personnel selection contains massive structures of data due to the number of potential candidates for job positions in various sub-divisions and departments. Therefore, the personnel selection problem in such environments can be subjected as a big data problem which should be handled prudently to save time and cost. The main objective of the current study is to extend the CLUS-MCDA approach (CLUSter analysis for improving Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis) and integrate it with the Best–Worst Method (BWM) and a specific structure to solve multi-scenario big data decision-making problems. In this study, to validate the practicality and reliability of the W-CLUS-MCDA approach, multiple personnel selection and risk assessment problems have been investigated with various scenarios within several departments, simultaneously. This study has also introduced the concept of multi-scenario parallel decision making (PDM) within the context of MADM methodology using a data-driven decision-making approach solving various big data problems.

These systems consist of multiple spherical lift-based turbines. The turbine configuration was modeled and fully parameterized to some design factors that can be changed in a code-based design. The physical concepts of the turbine were thoroughly analyzed to obtain a profound perception of the effect of each geometric parameter on the turbine performance. The performance improvement was investigated based on three metrics, namely the power coefficient, the probability of cavitation, and the pressure coefficient using a numerical analysis validated with some performed experiments. This validation indicates that the chosen numerical approach is reasonably reliable for turbine performance prediction with errors of less than 8%, approximately. The optimizable geometric model of the turbine, the highly accurate numerical method, and the analytical investigation developed in this study make available essential data for related studies.

We demonstrate how MCDA using multi-attribute value functions can be implemented in a Bayesian network with decision and utility nodes. An object-oriented Bayesian network is used to integrate impacts computed in quantitative sub-models of hydropower revenues and Atlantic salmon smolt production and qualitative judgement models of mesohabitat fishability and riverscape aesthetics. We show how conditional probability tables are useful for modelling uncertainty in value scaling functions, and variance in criteria weights due to different stakeholder preferences. While the paper demonstrates the technical feasibility of MCDA in a BN, we also discuss the challenges of providing decision-support to a real-world habitat remediation process.

AB  - Across the world, the flood magnitude is expected to increase as well as the damage caused by their occurrence. In this case, the prediction of areas which are highly susceptible to these phenomena becomes very important for the authorities. The present study is focused on the evaluation of flood potential within Trotuș river basin in Romania using six ensemble models created by the combination of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Certainty Factor (CF) and Weights of Evidence (WOE) on one hand, and Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) on the other hand. A number of 12 flood predictors, 172 flood locations and 172 non-flood locations were used. A percentage of 70% of flood and non-flood locations were used as input in models. From the input data, 70% were used as training sample and 30% as validating sample. The highest accuracy was obtained by the MLP-CF model in terms of both training (0.899) and testing (0.889) samples. A percentage between 21.88% and 36.33% of study area is covered with high and very high flood potential. The results validation, performed through the ROC Curve method, highlights that the MLP-CF model provided the most accurate results.

AB  - Flood is a devastating natural hazard that may cause damage to the environment infrastructure, and society. Hence, identifying the susceptible areas to flood is an important task for every country to prevent such dangerous consequences. The present study developed a framework for identifying flood-prone areas of the Topľa river basin, Slovakia using geographic information system (GIS), multi-criteria decision making approach (MCDMA), bivariate statistics (Frequency Ratio (FR), Statistical Index (SI)) and machine learning (Naïve Bayes Tree (NBT), Logistic Regression (LR)). To reach such a goal, different physical-geographical factors (criteria) were integrated and mapped. To access the relationship and interdependences among the criteria, decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and analytic network process (ANP) were used. Based on the experts’ decisions, the DEMATEL-ANP model was used to compute the relative weights of different criteria and a GIS-based linear combination was performed to derive the susceptibility index. Separately, the flood susceptibility index computation through NBT-FR and NBT-SI hybrid models assumed, in the first stage, the estimation of the weight of each class/category of conditioning factor through SI and FR and the integration of these values in NBT algorithm. The application of LR stand-alone required the calculation of the weights of conditioning factors by analysing their spatial relation with the location of the historical flood events. The study revealed that very high and high flood susceptibility classes covered between 20% and 47% of the study area, respectively. The validation of results, using the past flood points, highlighted that the hybrid DEMATEL-ANP model was the most performant with an Area Under ROC curve higher than 0.97, an accuracy of 0.922 and a value of HSS of 0.844. The presented methodological approach used for the identification of flood susceptible areas can serve as an alternative for the updating of preliminary flood risk assessment based on the EU Floods Directive.

AB  - In assessing sewage treatment systems, decision makers now have to consider sustainability, affordability, and reliability beyond functionality. To facilitate this complex assessment, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) tools have evolved recently. This case study illustrates an application of the Preference Ranking Organization METHod for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE) method in the MCDM process in evaluating five sewage treatment systems: activated sludge treatment followed by anaerobic digestion (P1); photoautotrophic algal treatment followed by hydrothermal liquefaction (P2) or by anaerobic digestion (P3); and, mixotrophic algal treatment followed by hydrothermal liquefaction (P4) or by anaerobic digestion (P5). This evaluation is based on 15 criteria aligned with the United Nation’s sustainable development goals. Based on energy recovery, the five processes ranked as follows: P2; P3; P4; P5; and P1. But, when all the 15 criteria are considered, P4 ranked as the most preferred option followed by P5 and P2. Utility of the MCDM approach in highlighting drawbacks of the options and identifying areas for improvement is illustrated. This study indicated that recovering phosphates and energy from the digested sludge in P1 offer greater potential to improve its ranking than by minimizing its energy demand for aeration. Increasing biomass density in the mixotrophic system can further improve its ranking, minimizing footprint and maximizing recoveries. Since the energy-intensity of hydrothermal liquefaction in P2 and P4 (4.57 and 23.23 kWh/kg BOD, respectively) is higher than that of anaerobic digestion in P1 (0.01 kWh/kg BOD), nutrient recovery from its byproducts has to be maximized to justify its selection.

AB  - Although a lot of research has focused on energy recovery and recycling of valuable materials from wastes to reduce loads on landfills, landfilling is still an inseparable part of solid waste management. Since landfills potentially pose a risk to human health and the surrounding environment, landfill site selection is an important endeavor that has to be carried out with great care. Choosing a suitable location for landfills depends on several factors and is a complicated procedure. In this paper, a comprehensive review of landfill site selection methods, with an emphasis on multi criteria decision making (multiple criteria decision analysis) has been presented. Assessments indicate that the most frequently used methods are weighted linear combination (WLC), ordered weighted averaging (OWA), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP), TODIM, fuzzy TODIM, analytic network process (ANP), fuzzy-analytic network process (F-ANP), and grey systems theory, each of which is discussed. The most widely used factors for selecting a landfill site are groundwater depth, surface water vicinity, elevation, land slope, soil permeability, soil stability, flooding susceptibility, lithology and stratification, faults, land use type, nearby settlements and urbanization, cultural and protected site vicinity, wind direction, roads, railways, proximity to building materials, pipelines and powerlines, and proximity to airports.

AB  - Flat roof solar PV design is an important and challenging process as it requires various parameters to be considered (such as weather, location, shading, regulations, purpose of use, etc.), and standard guidelines for building a solar PV system are not currently available. An even more challenging task is to improve the design of a solar PV system in order to optimize energy generation in a cost-effective manner, particularly in high-latitudes. In the present research, in order to determine optimal system size, parameters optimization should be carried out. The primary focus of this study is to develop an optimized system which maximizes generating capacity while maintaining cost-effectiveness of the solar PV system prior to the system implementation. Hence, a multi-objective optimization model is developed. The solar PV system design process is improved by optimizing the tilt angle and the inter-row spacing of solar PV modules. An objective function is developed based on the total solar energy generation per PV system and energy generation per PV module in order to improve cost effectiveness. The goal is to maximize these two outputs of the objective function. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is used to accomplish the optimization. Given that the two objectives are different and both have equal and opposite effects on the other, modifications are made to the PSO. Finally, the outputs of the optimization model are compared and validated with a case study. The model presented in this paper will assist users in decision making based on the technical output and financial aspects of the PV system.

AB  - Over the last decade, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively used in many commercial applications due to their manageability and risk avoidance. One of the main problems considered is the mission planning for multiple UAVs, where a solution plan must be found satisfying the different constraints of the problem. This problem has multiple variables that must be optimized simultaneously, such as the makespan, the cost of the mission or the risk. Therefore, the problem has a lot of possible optimal solutions, and the operator must select the final solution to be executed among them. In order to reduce the workload of the operator in this decision process, a Decision Support System (DSS) becomes necessary. In this work, a DSS consisting of ranking and filtering systems, which order and reduce the optimal solutions, has been designed. With regard to the ranking system, a wide range of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, including some fuzzy MCDM, are compared on a multi-UAV mission planning scenario, in order to study which method could fit better in a multi-UAV decision support system. Expert operators have evaluated the solutions returned, and the results show, on the one hand, that fuzzy methods generally achieve better average scores, and on the other, that all of the tested methods perform better when the preferences of the operators are biased towards a specific variable, and worse when their preferences are balanced. For the filtering system, a similarity function based on the proximity of the solutions has been designed, and on top of that, a threshold is tuned empirically to decide how to filter solutions without losing much of the hypervolume of the space of solutions.

AB  - Increasing attention was given to building information modeling (BIM) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) globally due to their advantages for various stages of the life cycle of a building. The aim of this paper is to improve practitioners' understanding of the process for BIM and MCDM adoption towards sustainable construction through energy efficiency. A questionnaire survey is being conducted for construction professionals and building industry experts in Malaysia. With expert survey data, a multi-criteria decision model using analytical network process (ANP) was built to identify key factors affecting sustainable building by reducing both embodied and operational energy and carbon emissions. Data from the survey was analysed using descriptive statistics. Model developed consisted of three clusters with a total of six nodes, and the level of importance was compared pairwise with one another. Results shows that design optimisation, reduced material requirements are important factors for sustainable construction considered in the BIM application.

AB  - Today, in many organizations, the debate about the difference in core capabilities has become an important factor for market competition. Companies, based on the field of activity, decide to strengthen some of their capabilities, capacities, and expertise. Therefore, the focus of an organization on the strengths and efforts to develop its sustainability will lead to a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Due to changes in environmental factors, organizations have focused on carbon emissions in procurement and transportation that have the highest carbon footprint. This paper proposes a multi-objective, eco-sustainability model for a supply chain. The objectives are to minimize overall costs, maximize the efficiency of transportation vehicles and minimize information fraud in the process of information sharing within supply chain elements. Big data is considered in the amount of information exchanged between customers and other elements of the proposed supply chain; since there are frauds in information sharing then using big data 5Vs the model is adapted to control the cost of information loss leading to customer dissatisfaction. Since uncertainty is inevitable in the real environments, in this research hybrid uncertainty is considered. Because two sources of uncertainty are considered in most of the parameters, thus it is necessary to robustify the decision-making process. The model is a mixed integer nonlinear program including big data for an optimal sustainable procurement and transportation decision. A heuristic method is used to solve the big data problem that makes use of a robust fuzzy stochastic programming approach. The proposed model can prevent disturbances by using a scenario-based stochastic programming approach. An effective hybrid robust fuzzy stochastic method is also employed for controlling uncertainty in parameters and risk taking out of outbound decisions. To solve the multi-objective model, augmented ε-constraint method is utilized. The model performance is investigated in a comprehensive computational study.

AB  - The theories of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) and fuzzy logic both aim to model human thinking. In MCDM, aggregation processes and preference modeling play the central role. This paper suggests a consistent framework for modeling human thinking by using the tools of both fields: fuzzy logical operators as well as aggregation and preference operators. In this framework, aggregation, preference, and the logical operators are described by the same unary generator function. Similarly to the implication being defined as a composition of the disjunction and the negation operator, preference operators were introduced as a composition of the aggregative operator and the negation operator. After a profound examination of the main properties of the preference operator, our main goal is the implementation into neural networks. We show how preference can be modeled by a perceptron, and illustrate the results in practical neural applications.

AB  - Since the traditional geographical routing protocol and its variants use only single metric in routing process, they cannot handle with several problems such as congestion, network holes and link loss. To solve these problems, multi-metric geographical routing protocol have been proposed, however, most of them cannot adaptively change their forwarding policy according to network conditions because they fail to define the relationship or priorities between multiple metrics. To address this limitations, in this paper, we apply multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method to the geographical routing protocol to accommodate multiple metrics in a logical way. In addition, we propose a new dynamic priority scheme to select the most suitable next hop by differentiating the priorities based on the network environment. Simulation results prove that our approach can achieve better performance than existing geographical routing protocols in the aspects of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and routing overhead.

AB  - The main focus of this paper is to present thermodynamic and economic analyses and multi-objective optimization of a novel geothermal-solar multigeneration system. The system aims to produce hydrogen, freshwater, electricity, cooling load, and hot water and designed based on geothermal and solar energy. After modeling and thermodynamic and economic analysis, exergy destruction rate, exergy efficiency and, cost rate were calculated for each component of the system. The results showed that the highest amount of exergy destruction was related to parabolic trough collectors (PTCs) and absorption chillers. To select the geothermal fluid of the organic Rankine cycle (ORC), several different fluids were investigated, among which isobutene was selected. By using the Group method of data handling (GMDH) neural network, a mathematical relationship was obtained between the inputs and outputs of the problem and were given as inputs to the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII)alg. The final optimal point was obtained applying the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) decision criterion at which the exergy efficiency and cost rate were calculated to be 21.63% and 63.89 $/h, respectively. The meteorological data of the Zanjan, Isfahan, and Bandar Abbas cities were used to calculate the performance accurately at the TOPSIS selection point. To provide a comparison between different cities, the performance of the system was evaluated on September 17 as a sample day. On this day, the proposed system produces 26.38 kg of hydrogen and 373.8 m3 of freshwater in Isfahan.

AB  - By means of a fuzzy coimplication operator J and a triangular conorm S, we set forth two pairs of (J,S)-fuzzy rough set models, which are generalizations of fuzzy rough sets. Then, according to the classifications of the coimplication operators (R-coimplicators and T-coimplicators), we investigate relationships among our proposed models and some existing rough set models. In this paper, by the idea of the PROMETHEE method, we apply (J,S)-fuzzy rough set models to make decisions with evaluation of fuzzy information. An example illustrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method to solve practical problems. By comparing the ranking results of the existing methods and our proposed method, we observe that the optimal selected alternative is the same, which means that there is a consistency among our proposed decision-making method and the existing methods. In addition, we find that the traditional methods may fail in some practical situations while our proposed method is still valid.

Objectives
To combine cross-sectoral stakeholders’ preferences over interventions for knee osteoarthritis (OA) with guideline recommendations and evidence about interventions, and to investigate if these preferences differ by stakeholder group.
Design
A survey based on multi-criteria decision analysis was implemented whereby the stakeholders revealed the relative importance, represented as weights, of eight criteria for choosing or recommending knee OA interventions. Using data from an OA clinical guideline, 15 recommended interventions were rated on the criteria and ranked by their total scores, calculated by summing the corresponding weights. Associations between the weights and stakeholder groups were explored using regression analysis.
Results
Participants comprised 58 consumers with OA, 5 ​Māori health advocates, 79 healthcare providers, 24 policy-informants and 12 OA-researchers (N ​= ​178; 63% female, [mean age±SD] 54 ​± ​13 years). Mean weights on the eight criteria, in decreasing order of importance, are: recommendation: 19.0%; quality of evidence: 17.7%; effectiveness: 15.0%; duration of effect: 13.2%; risk of serious harm: 12.8%; risk of mild/moderate side-effects: 9.4%; cost: 6.6%; and accessibility: 6.3%. For first-, second- and third-line OA interventions respectively, all land-based exercise (total score ​= ​71.7%), NSAIDs (topical) (74.2%) and total joint replacement (74.3%) were ranked first. At all care phases, the recommended core interventions of weight management and self-management education ranked between 11th and 15th (48.0%–56.0%). Regression analysis identified only small differences in weights (≤5.7%; p ​< ​0.01) between stakeholder groups.
Conclusions
Not all recommended core interventions are preferred by cross-sectoral stakeholders, which may represent a barrier to their uptake. Stakeholders’ preferences do not appreciably differ by stakeholder group.

AB  - Climate-adaptive design, smart control, latent thermal storages, multi-dimensional uncertainty analysis, and multi-objective optimisations are effective solutions for cooling performance enhancement of buildings through integrated techniques, such as hybrid ventilations, nocturnal sky radiation, radiative cooling and active PV cooling for the self-consumption. However, there is no systematic and in-depth analysis on this topic in the academia. In this study, a state-of-the-art review on novel PCMs based strategies to reduce cooling load of buildings has been presented. The investigated strategies include the structural configuration, systematic control and the multi-criteria for assessment. The roles of ventilations, radiative cooling and the underlying heat transfer mechanism have been characterized for the in-depth understanding. In order to realise the multivariable optimal design and robust operations under multi-level scenario uncertainties, parametric and uncertainty analysis, single- and multi-objective optimisations have been comprehensively reviewed, together with technical challenges for each solution. Research results show that, integrated passive and active systems with flexible transitions on operating modes are full of prospects for the multi-criteria performance improvement. Trade-off solutions along the multi-objective Pareto frontier are multi-diversified, dependent on the adopted approach and the studied scenario. Furthermore, machine learning methods are promising for the thermal and energy performances improvement, through the surrogate model development, the model predictive control and the optimisation function. Future studies and prospects have been demonstrated as avenues for future research. This study presents a systematic overview on novel PCMs based strategies, together with the application of machine-learning methods for cooling performance enhancement, which are critical for the promotion of novel PCMs based cooling strategies in buildings.

To overcome this issue, this study extends the application of the expert system to corporate credit risk and distress prediction through proposing a Multi-criteria Decision Aid (MCDA), namely PROMETHEE II, which provides a multi-criteria evaluation of competing DPMs. In addition, using data on Chinese firms listed on Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, we perform an exhaustive comparative analysis of the most popular DPMs; namely, statistical, artificial intelligence and machine learning models under both mono-criterion and multi-criteria frameworks. Further, we address two prevailing research questions; namely, "which DPM performs better in predicting distress?" and "will training models with corporate governance indicators (CGIs) enhance the performance of models?”; and discuss our findings. Our multi-criteria ranking suggests that non-parametric DPMs outperform parametric ones, where random forest and bagging CART are among the best machine learning DPMs. Further, models fed with CGIs as features outperform those fed without CGIs.

AB  - Energy efficiency of public sector is an important issue in the context of smart cities due to the fact that buildings are the largest energy consumers, especially public buildings such as educational, health, government and other public institutions that have a large usage frequency. However, recent developments of machine learning within Big Data environment have not been exploited enough in this domain. This paper aims to answer the question of how to incorporate Big Data platform and machine learning into an intelligent system for managing energy efficiency of public sector as a substantial part of the smart city concept. Deep neural networks, Rpart regression tree and Random forest with variable reduction procedures were used to create prediction models of specific energy consumption of Croatian public sector buildings. The most accurate model was produced by Random forest method, and a comparison of important predictors extracted by all three methods has been conducted. The models could be implemented in the suggested intelligent system named MERIDA which integrates Big Data collection and predictive models of energy consumption for each energy source in public buildings, and enables their synergy into a managing platform for improving energy efficiency of the public sector within Big Data environment. The paper also discusses technological requirements for developing such a platform that could be used by public administration to plan reconstruction measures of public buildings, to reduce energy consumption and cost, as well as to connect such smart public buildings as part of smart cities. Such digital transformation of energy management can increase energy efficiency of public administration, its higher quality of service and healthier environment.

AB  - The contamination of waters by persistent organic pollutants, especially pharmaceutical contaminants, is one of the concerns all over the world. To date, among the treatment methods, the efficient EAOPs method have shown a high ability to treat this type of pollutant. However, conducting adequate tests for taking into account almost all possible conditions to predict the amount of pollutant removal in different conditions is still a challenge. On the other hand, achieving this aim requires a lot of cost and time. The superiority of data mining based methods over conventional mathematical methods have made these methods a good solution to solve this problem. Hence, in present study a model by employing data mining algorithms includes Artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), M5 model tree, least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) and hybrid of LSSVM and firefly optimization algorithm (FFA), scatter interpolation method, and multi-criteria decision making, namely DID, is presented for modeling of drugs removal. For this purpose, four different inputs include current density, electrolyte concentration, pH, and electrolysis time are used for electrochemical removal of Ciprofloxacin (CIP) as a model pollutant. Subsequently, Scatter interpolation method is used for generating enough data for more accurate modeling and more reliable results. In the final part of the survey, the TOPSIS method under six scenario, is employed for ranking of algorithms by considering accuracy and time criteria. In defined scenarios for TOPSIS, six different weights are considered for time criteria as well as the weights of accuracy are considered as equal in each scenario. Also, the sum of scores of each algorithm in all scenarios is used for final decision. The finding results by TOPSIS for original data showed the superiority of LSSVM_FFA. After generating new data, the M5 and the ANFIS have better results in 0.25 time weight. However, by decreasing time weight and increasing accuracy weight (after second scenario), the M5 and the LSSVM_FFA have better results. Besides, based on the sum of scores for new data, the M5 and the LSSVM_FFA have superiority. Finally, it can be concluded that M5 in about to 3 s, and LSSVM_FFA in about to 17 s lead to estimate the drug removal value with good accuracy, and without needing to high cost, and several months laboratory works. Therefore, the mentioned models can be used for different tasks, such as determining the optimal removal of drug, and investigating the impact of different parameters on drug removal process, without needing to each special experiment. Thus, for generating the large data set, the results of the present study are reliable.

AB  - To reduce the negative effects of tourism on the environment, the importance of ecotourism is increasingly considered because this form of tourism helps to protect the environment and sustainable development of an area. So, it is important to determine suitable places for tourism to better manage the study area. The aim of this study is to identify potential ecotourism sites using ordered weight averaging (OWA) and fuzzy quantifier algorithms in the east and central of Fars province, Iran. Required spatial data such as geology, soil, slope land, topographic roughness index (TRI), vegetation, surface water, elevation, protected area, climate, distance to road, and distance to the village were utilized. To prepare ecotourism maps with different confidence levels, eleven ordered weights were applied corresponding to the eleven parameters that were rank-ordered for each parameter after the modified factor weights were applied. Also, the feature selection algorithm (random search and genetic search methods) was used to select the most important parameters to determine the ecotourism map. The results showed that, with decreasing risk (α = 0), almost all of the study area was unsuitable for ecotourism while, with increasing risk (α = 20), all of the study areas were suitable for ecotourism. One of the ecotourism maps prepared with different confidence levels can be suggested based on the different conditions of tourists so that, if the tourist has a limited time, ecotourism maps with a higher degree of confidence levels are recommended and vice versa. This is one of the innovations of the present research. Also, the results of the random search method with the least error show that slope, elevation, climate, distance to river, and distance to road parameters are the most important parameters in preparing the ecotourism map of the region. So, using the results of the research, many economic problems, such as unemployment, will be solved by managers by preparing tourism maps and creating service jobs for tourists. With the OWA method, tourism zoning maps can be controlled by managers in order to provide better services and social and economic justice.

AB  - Ranking and prioritizing pavement infrastructure for maintenance and rehabilitation have become major undertakings for several departments of transportation around the globe. This is a complex decision-making problem because multiple and conflicting criteria can contribute to the assessment. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques evaluate the trade-off between several quantitative and qualitative criteria and facilitate complex decision-making. This research introduces a framework based on MCDA to support pavement management decision making, while quantifying emerging sustainability-related factors such as safety, noise, and pollution in the decision-making process. The framework features include 1) identifying pavement management main decision elements: objectives, criteria, and attributes by detailing the problem with a five-level hierarchy structure; 2) employing combined analytic hierarchy process and multi-attribute utility theory to develop representative set of utility functions; and 3) ranking and prioritizing large networks of pavement sections while incorporating sustainability-related criteria. Data used to assess the decision criteria and develop the utility functions is extracted by means of a questionnaire survey completed by professionals working in the field of pavement management. The proposed method is applied to a case study consisting of ten pavement sections extracted from the long-term pavement performance database, wherein the sections are ranked based on their attributes. Sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of the different criteria on the ranking process. The proposed method has shown potential in ranking pavement networks based on the identified criteria. Future work can test the performance of the proposed methodology with a full-scale pavement network and apply it to other civil infrastructure assets to evaluate its performance with different types of projects.

AB  - Taking into account the exponential growth of the number of flash-floods events worldwide, the detection of areas prone to these natural hazards is one of the main activities taken in order to mitigate the negative effects of these risk phenomena. In the present paper, new modeling approaches, Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) integrated with IOE (ADT-IOE) and ADT integrated with AHP (ADT-AHP), were proposed for flash-flood susceptibility mapping across the Suha river catchment (Romania). Besides, two stand-alone methods, Index of Entropy (IOE) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), were also investigated. For this regard, 111 torrential points and 111 non-torrential points along with 8 flash-flood conditioning factors have been involved in the training process of the four models. The quality of the flash-flood models was checked by using the ROC Curve method, classification accuracy (CLA), and Kappa index. The result shows that the two ensemble models, the ADT-IOE (AUC = 0.972, CLC = 86.37%, Kappa statistics = 0.727) and the ADT-AHP (AUC = 0.926, CLA = 87.88%, Kappa statistics = 0.758), have high prediction performance and outperform the other models. Therefore, ADT-IOE and ADT-AHP are new and promising tools for flash-flood susceptibility modeling.

AB  - There is little interest in prefabrication in the construction industries of developing countries, despite all its advantages. The main challenge goes back to the low level of knowledge and wrong believes about the productivity of prefabrication construction systems in comparison with conventional ones. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive and systemic decision-making tool to assess the productivity of construction systems of residential buildings. First, the determinants of productivity are identified using the Delphi method. Then, the Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method is used to determine the level of influence of various criteria. Thereafter, the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method is utilized to determine the importance weight of criteria and finally, the ranking is done by the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. Our analysis indicated that the management and planning criterion is the most influential criteria, and the cost is the most impressionable criterion in terms of productivity. Also, the case study results demonstrated that the prefabricated concrete buildings are the most productive ones, compared to the other two construction systems of prefabricated, and in-situ concrete. In the lack of possibility of complete prefabricated method, the combination of in-situ and prefabricated concrete construction system can be applied as a productive method in building the structure and façade. Finally, the results confirmed that the proposed decision-making process could assist the investors to select the most appropriate prefabricated construction system to achieve the highest level of productivity.

AB  - Cloud service provider selection, an important Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem involves intrinsic relations among the multiple alternatives, attributes and decision experts for the selection of trustworthy Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Due to uncertain and incomplete nature of the cloud service provider evaluation data, i.e., Quality of Service (QoS) and user feedbacks, the identification of suitable CSPs with accurate service ranking remains an open research challenge. To address the above-mentioned challenge, this work presents an Improved Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets-Weighted Aggregate Sum and Product Assessment (IIVIFS-WASPAS) based cloud service provider selection approach for the identification of Trustworthy CSPs (TCSPs). The proposed CSP selection approach employs integrated objective and subjective weight assessment method and IVIFS-WASPAS method to determine the importance of QoS attributes and to rank the TCSPs respectively. Further, a novel preference-attitudinal score and accuracy function of IIVIFS have been designed based on the decision maker’s attitude to rank the TCSPs. Case studies using Cloud Armor, a real-world trust feedback dataset demonstrates the accuracy, effectiveness, and feasibility of IIVIFS-WASPAS approach for CSP selection problem in terms of sensitivity analysis and Rank Reversal Phenomenon (RRP).

AB  - Rainfall data are needed for water resource management and decision making and are obtained from rainfall networks. These data are especially important for streamflow simulations and forecasting the occurrence of intense rainfall during the flood season. Therefore, rainfall networks should be carefully designed and evaluated. Several methods are used for rainfall network design, and information theory-based methods have recently received significant attention. This study focuses on the design of a rainfall network, especially for streamflow simulation. A multi-objective design method is proposed and applied to the Wei River basin in China. We use the total correlation as an indicator of information redundancy and multivariate transinformation as an indicator of information transfer. Information redundancy refers to the overlap of information between rainfall stations, and information transfer refers to the rainfall-runoff relationship. The outlet streamflow station (Huaxian station in the Wei River basin) is used as the target station for the streamflow simulation. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA‐II) was used for the multi-objective optimization of the rainfall network design. We compared the proposed multi-objective design with two other methods using an artificial neural network (ANN) model. The optimized rainfall network from the proposed method led to reasonable outlet streamflow forecasts with a balance between network efficiency and streamflow simulation. Our results indicate that the multi-objective strategy provides an effective design by which the rainfall network can consider the rainfall-runoff process and benefit streamflow prediction on a catchment scale.

AB  - In variable-pitch wind turbines, pitch angle control is implemented to regulate the rotor speed and power production. However, mechanical loads of the wind turbines are affected by the pitch angle adjustment. To improve the performance and at the same time alleviate the mechanical loads, a gain-scheduling fractional-order PID (FOPID), where a trained RBF neural network chooses its parameters is proposed. The database, which the RBF neural network is trained based on, is created via optimization of a FOPID in several wind speeds with chaotic differential evolution (CDE) algorithm. The simulation results are compared to an RBF based PID controller that is designed via the same method, a conventional gain-scheduling baseline PI controller developed by NREL, an optimal RBF based PI controller, and a FOPI controller. The simulations indicate that the RBF based FOPID improves the control performance of the benchmark wind turbine in comparison to the other controllers, while the applied loads to the structure are mitigated. To validate the performance and robustness, all controllers are implemented on FAST wind turbine simulator. The superiority of the proposed FOPID controller is depicted in comparison to the other controllers.

AB  - The river health assessment (RHA) usually concerns multiple criteria including streamflow, ecology, physical structure, water quality and social service functions and evaluation standards formulated by managers as well as groups with different interests. Conventional multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) models are used to comprehensively evaluate river condition through multiple criteria under deterministic environment. In fact, uncertainties are always existed in these criteria data since they are correlated with hydrology and water resources system. In this work, we proposed a stochastic cloud model based MCDM framework for solving RHA considering multiple uncertainties in criteria performance values (PVs) and criteria weights (CWs). The cloud model is allied to describe uncertainty of PVs using numerous drops following normal distribution generated by forward drop generator (FDG). The minimum deviation principle based aggregated CWs are utilized to efficiently quantify uncertainty in CWs and reduce conflict between multiple CWs sources. A novel stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) is developed coupling with grey correlation analysis (GCA) and TOPSIS. The risk information for river evaluation caused by multiple uncertainties are described using quantified decision error risk (QDER) and rank uncertainty degree (RUD). The proposed methodology is verified practicability by applying it to river health evaluation in Taihu basin. The numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate superiority and efficiency of novel SMAA in comparison with conventional SMAA and deterministic MCDM models based on GCA and TOPSIS. The robustness analysis is implemented to disclose its computation stability and reliability as well as effects of cloud parameters on final MCDM results. The results of novel SMAA show that it provides river managers with comprehensive river health and risk analysis information, assisting them to make highly reliable assessment and adopt effective measures harnessing rivers.

AB  - The Choquet integral model is mainly applied to describe non-additive multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. This paper considers the Choquet integral as a classifier which deals with complicated high-dimensional data. Although previously conducted studies have investigated the problem of classification using the Choquet integral and provided corresponding models, these models usually need to estimate a large number of fuzzy measure coefficients, which are not suitable when considering real situations. Sugeno et al. proposed the hierarchical Choquet integral (HCI) model to overcome this problem. However, the HCI model requires partition information of the criteria, which often cannot be obtained practically. This paper proposes two HCI models—shallow and deep models—by employing genetic algorithms (GAs) and neural networks (NNs) to automatically construct the structure of the HCI. The results of numerical experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the existing Naïve Bayes, decision tree, and NN models.

AB  - Constraint-based parameterization is of vital importance to the airbreathing hypersonic vehicle due to the strong integration between the scramjet engine and the airframe. In the current study, an enhanced free-form deformation approach is proposed and utilized to parameterize the EXPERT geometric configuration with its prescribed constraints satisfied. Considering the boundary feature of the Bernstein basis function, the non-parallelepiped free-form deformation lattice is assigned quickly and modified automatically. The configuration is optimized by the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) coupled with the Kriging surrogate model. The maximum lift-to-drag ratio, the maximum volumetric efficiency and the minimum heating rate at the stagnation point are all taken as the objective functions in the optimization process. At last, the Pareto front is obtained, and the surrogate-based predicted results show reasonable agreement with the data obtained by the engineering approaches. Finally, some optimized configurations are reconstructed, and the preservation of the prescribed constraints is observed.

AB  - Earthquakes are natural phenomena, which induce natural hazard that seriously threatens urban areas, despite significant advances in retrofitting urban buildings and enhancing the knowledge and ability of experts in natural disaster control. Iran is one of the most seismically active countries in the world. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and analyze the extent of earthquake vulnerability in relation to demographic, environmental, and physical criteria. An earthquake risk assessment (ERA) map was created by using a Fuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process coupled with an Artificial Neural Networks (FAHP-ANN) model generating five vulnerability classes. Combining the application of a FAHP-ANN with a geographic information system (GIS) enabled to assign weights to the layers of the earthquake vulnerability criteria. The model was applied to Sanandaj City in Iran, located in the seismically active Sanandaj-Sirjan zone which is frequently affected by devastating earthquakes. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model was implemented in the IDRISI software and 250 points were validated for grades 0 and 1. The validation process revealed that the proposed model can produce an earthquake probability map with an accuracy of 95%. A comparison of the results attained by using a FAHP, AHP and MLP model shows that the hybrid FAHP-ANN model proved flexible and reliable when generating the ERA map. The FAHP-ANN model accurately identified the highest earthquake vulnerability in densely populated areas with dilapidated building infrastructure. The findings of this study are useful for decision makers with a scientific basis to develop earthquake risk management strategies.

AB  - Big data projects, including smart-city-related big data projects, are facing an alarmingly high percentage of failure. The reasons behind this phenomenon and the lessons learned from it are well researched. However, big data projects are still failing, as there is a lack of effective models to leverage the lessons learned from previous projects to evaluate an organization’s readiness for a big data project. In this paper, the authors introduce a novel readiness assessment model. This model leverages the lessons learned from previous projects and the experience of experts to be better prepared for an upcoming smart-city-related big data project. Cities can use the model to evaluate their readiness for this type of project in a structured and comprehensive way that will allow for higher chances of conducting a successful big data project. To develop the model, hierarchical decision modeling (HDM) and expert judgment quantification were used to provide the categorization and relative ranking of factors that influence smart-city-related big data projects. HDM is an effective way to understand the relationship between multiple factors and allows for expert panels to prioritize those factors. Moreover, desirability functions were used to extend the understanding of the factors’ dynamics and what needs to be done to better prepare for the challenges associated with each factor. Finally, the model was tested by applying it to several smart-city-related big data projects to show its value. This research highlights the importance of readiness assessment for conducting big data projects and provides a readiness assessment model that cities can use to prepare for an upcoming big data project.

AB  - The major role of banks is to play financial intermediation function between funding needs and funding surpluses. Any problem in the banking system directly influences not only the stakeholders but also the general economy. There have been many attempts to measure the performance of banks by using Multi-Criteria Decision Making Tools (MCDM). This study aims to assess the performance of the publicly traded banks in Borsa Istanbul operating in the Turkish banking sector for the four quarter of 2018. Contribution of this study can be summarized as follow. Dataset is consisted of three dimensions: (i) financial ratios, (ii) branch and personnel network, (iii) daily stock market returns and standard deviation of daily returns. Using a multi-dimensional dataset compiled from three different data sources enabled an objective assessment of bank performance. Features are selected from the financial ratio dataset by using Self-Organizing Maps technique. Instead of using single weight set, a million weight combinations are calculated to monitor the score distributions of MCDM tools. EDAS, MOORA, OCRA and TOPSIS techniques are selected due to their similarity in calculation steps. It is found that OCRA technique produced consistent rankings for different periods. Highest correlation coefficients observed between OCRA and TOPSIS techniques.
