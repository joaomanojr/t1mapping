abstract = {An important goal for machine learning is to transfer knowledge between tasks. For example, learning to play RoboCup Keepaway should contribute to learning the full game of RoboCup soccer. Previous approaches to transfer in Keepaway have focused on transforming the original representation to fit the new task. In contrast, this paper explores the idea that transfer is most effective if the representation is designed to be the same even across different tasks. To demonstrate this point, a bird's eye view (BEV) representation is introduced that can represent different tasks on the same two-dimensional map. For example, both the 3 vs. 2 and 4 vs. 3 Keepaway tasks can be represented on the same BEV. Yet the problem is that a raw two-dimensional map is high-dimensional and unstructured. This paper shows how this problem is addressed naturally by an idea from evolutionary computation called indirect encoding, which compresses the representation by exploiting its geometry. The result is that the BEV learns a Keepaway policy that transfers without further learning or manipulation. It also facilitates transferring knowledge learned in a different domain, Knight Joust, into Keepaway. Finally, the indirect encoding of the BEV means that its geometry can be changed without altering the solution. Thus static representations facilitate several kinds of transfer.},

abstract = {The process of pairwise comparison (PC) in AHP requires the decision maker to fill a total number of kn elements in k matrices (n and k are the number of alternatives and criteria, respectively). The decision making process becomes a more time consuming process with a higher possibility of making human errors by the increase in the value of kn. In this paper, a self regulating approach to AHP’s PC, inspired by the similar process in PROMETHEE II, is proposed. In this approach the decision maker does not have to identify all of the kn elements directly; therefore, the production of final results will be faster and even more accurate. The proposed approach is implemented and evaluated with real world data. The results show an outstanding consistency (Cons0.70) between the final output of this modified version of AHP and that of the other three multi-criteria decision making methods, which are used in our experiments.},

abstract = {Broad metric classes were proposed in the literature in order to facilitate metric selection for evaluating human-autonomous vehicle interaction. However, there still lacks a systematic method for selecting an efficient set of metrics from the many metrics available. We previously identified a list of evaluation criteria that can help determine the quality of a metric, and generated a list of potential metric costs and benefits. Depending on research objectives and limitations, these costs and benefits can have different weights of importance. Through an experiment with subject matter experts, we investigated which metric characteristics human factors practitioners consider to be important in evaluating human supervisory control of unmanned vehicles. We also tested two different multi-criteria decision making methods to help practitioners assign subjective weights to the cost/benefit criteria. The majority of participants rated the evaluation criteria used in both tools as very useful. However, the majority of participants' metric selections before using the methods were the same as the suggestions provided by the methods. Since determining weights of metric importance is an inherently subjective process, even with objective computational tools, the real value of using such a tool may be reminding human factors practitioners of the important experimental criteria and relationships between these criteria that should be considered when designing an experiment.},

abstract = {This paper highlights the diversity of spatial data of rural and urban properties, constantly generated by different public institutions, as well as the existing problems of exchange of information among them. Firstly, this work describes the results obtained in the study and development of an agile flexible method to offer support construction, implementation and accompaniment activities of free geo-solutions for the web, aiming at a growing community of users and developers who manipulate geographic data. Next, the development of the OpenICGFw (Integration for Collaborative Geospatial Framework for the Web) that seeks, through a single environment to assist in the integration and collaboration among different sources of spatial data in synchrony with the efforts and specifications of OGC and W3C. To do this, the evaluation study for the construction of the framework is presented where it was possible to apply MCDA-C (Multi Criteria Decision Aiding -- Constructivist) in the identification of the fundamental and elementary aspects for the construction of the framework. Details are presented by means of a case study that illustrates data exported from different geospatial information systems requiring the integration of census, environmental, urban and rural information over the internet. During the discussion the results obtained using this framework are presented, providing, through web mapping applications, the implementation of collaborative strategies seeking the integration of bases distributed for the use of spatial data mining techniques.},

abstract = {Associative classification is a rule-based approach to classify data relying on association rule mining by discovering associations between a set of features and a class label. Support and confidence are the de-facto "interestingness measures" used for discovering relevant association rules. The support-confidence framework has also been used in most, if not all, associative classifiers. Although support and confidence are appropriate measures for building a strong model in many cases, they are still not the ideal measures and other measures could be better suited.There are many other rule interestingness measures already used in machine learning, data mining and statistics. This work focuses on using 53 different objective measures for associative classification rules. A wide range of UCI datasets are used to study the impact of different "inter-estingness measures" on different phases of associative classifiers based on the number of rules generated and the accuracy obtained. The results show that there are interesting-ness measures that can significantly reduce the number of rules for almost all datasets while the accuracy of the model is hardly jeopardized or even improved. However, no single measure can be introduced as an obvious winner.},

abstract = {Computational reflection is a well-established technique that gives a program the ability to dynamically observe and possibly modify its behaviour. To date, however, reflection is mainly applied either to the software architecture or its implementation. We know of no approach that fully supports requirements reflection- that is, making requirements available as runtime objects. Although there is a body of literature on requirements monitoring, such work typically generates runtime artefacts from requirements and so the requirements themselves are not directly accessible at runtime. In this paper, we define requirements reflection and a set of research challenges. Requirements reflection is important because software systems of the future will be self-managing and will need to adapt continuously to changing environmental conditions. We argue requirements reflection can support such self-adaptive systems by making requirements first-class runtime entities, thus endowing software systems with the ability to reason about, understand, explain and modify requirements at runtime.},

We introduce a novel approach significantly reducing domination tests for a given subspace and the number of subspaces searched. Technically, we identify two types of skyline points that can be directly derived without using any domination tests. Moreover, based on formal concept analysis, we introduce two closure operators that enable a concise representation of skyline cubes. We show that this concise representation is easy to compute and develop an efficient algorithm, which only needs to search a small portion of the huge search space. We show with empirical results the merits of our approach.},

abstract = {Computing preference queries has received a lot of attention in the database community. It is common that the user is unsure of his/her preference, so care must be taken to elicit the preference of the user correctly. In this paper, we propose to elicit the preferred ordering of a user by utilizing skyline objects as the representatives of the possible ordering. We introduce the notion of order-based representative skylines which selects representatives based on the orderings that they represent. To further facilitate preference exploration, a hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to compute a denogram on the skyline objects. By coupling the hierarchical clustering with visualization techniques, we allow users to refine their preference weight settings by browsing the hierarchy. Extensive experiments were conducted and the results validate the feasibility and the efficiency of our approach.},

abstract = {Imagine a system that gives you satisfying recommendations when you want to rent a movie with friends or find a restaurant to celebrate a colleague's farewell: at the core of such a system is what we call group recommendation. While computing individual recommendations have received lots of attention (e.g., Netflix prize), group recommendation has been confined to studying users' satisfaction with different aggregation strategies. In this paper (Some results are published in an earlier conference paper (Amer-Yahia et al. in VLDB, 2009). See Sect. "Paper contributions and outline" for details.), we describe the challenges and desiderata of group recommendation and formalize different group consensus semantics that account for both an item's predicted ratings to the group members and the disagreements among them. We focus on the design and implementation of efficient group recommendation algorithms that intelligently prune and merge per-user predicted rating lists and pairwise disagreement lists of items. We further explore the impact of space constraints on maintaining per-user and pairwise item lists and develop two complementary solutions that leverage shared user behavior to maintain the efficiency of our recommendation algorithms within a space budget. The first solution, behavior factoring, factors out user agreements from disagreement lists, while the second solution, partial materialization, selectively materializes a subset of disagreement lists. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our group recommendations and the efficiency and scalability of our algorithms using an extensive set of experiments on the 10 M ratings MovieLens data set.},
