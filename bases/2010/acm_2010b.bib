abstract = {This paper will be a discussion on making robots more autonomous. This type of research in the past has not only involved space related applications but also motion devices on Earth such as automobiles and aircraft. This work will mainly involve mobile robots but also stationary ones as well.},

abstract = {This paper highlights the diversity of spatial data of rural and urban properties, constantly generated by different public institutions, as well as the existing problems of exchange of information among them. Firstly, this work describes the results obtained in the study and development of an agile flexible method to offer support construction, implementation and accompaniment activities of free geo-solutions for the web, aiming at a growing community of users and developers who manipulate geographic data. Next, the development of the OpenICGFw (Integration for Collaborative Geospatial Framework for the Web) that seeks, through a single environment to assist in the integration and collaboration among different sources of spatial data in synchrony with the efforts and specifications of OGC and W3C. To do this, the evaluation study for the construction of the framework is presented where it was possible to apply MCDA-C (Multi Criteria Decision Aiding -- Constructivist) in the identification of the fundamental and elementary aspects for the construction of the framework. Details are presented by means of a case study that illustrates data exported from different geospatial information systems requiring the integration of census, environmental, urban and rural information over the internet. During the discussion the results obtained using this framework are presented, providing, through web mapping applications, the implementation of collaborative strategies seeking the integration of bases distributed for the use of spatial data mining techniques.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique that can handle multi-objective optimization problems. It is based on the strength Pareto approach originally used in evolutionary algorithms (EA). The proposed modified particle swarm algorithm is used to build three hybrid EA-PSO algorithms to solve different multi-objective optimization problems. This algorithm and its hybrid forms are tested using seven benchmarks from the literature and the results are compared to the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2) and a competitive multi-objective PSO using several metrics. The proposed algorithm shows a slower convergence, compared to the other algorithms, but requires less CPU time. Combining PSO and evolutionary algorithms leads to superior hybrid algorithms that outperform SPEA2, the competitive multi-objective PSO (MO-PSO), and the proposed strength Pareto PSO based on different metrics.},
