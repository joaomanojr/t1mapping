N2  - During the last decade, Cloud computing has efficiently exploited the economy of scale by providing low cost computational and storage resources over the Internet, eventually leading to consolidation of computing resources into large data centers. However, the nascent of the highly decentralized Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that cannot effectively utilize the centralized Cloud infrastructures pushes computing towards resource dispersion. Fog computing extends the Cloud paradigm by enabling dispersion of the computational and storage resources at the edge of the network in a close proximity to where the data is generated. In its essence, Fog computing facilitates the operation of the limited compute, storage and networking resources physically located close to the edge devices. However, the shared complexity of the Fog and the influence of the recent IoT trends moving towards deploying and interconnecting extremely large sets of pervasive devices and sensors, requires exploration of adaptive Fog architectural approaches capable of adapting and scaling in response to the unpredictable load patterns of the distributed IoT applications. In this paper we introduce a promising new nature- inspired Fog architecture, named SmartFog, capable of providing low decision making latency and adaptive resource management. By utilizing novel algorithms and techniques from the fields of multi- criteria decision making, graph theory and machine learning we model the Fog as a distributed intelligent processing system, therefore emulating the function of the human brain.

N2  - This paper discusses a method for dealing with limited data in deep networks based on calculating the uncertainty associated with remaining training data. The method was developed for the Watershed REstoration using Spatio-Temporal Optimization of REsources (WRESTORE) system, an interactive decision support system designed for performing multi-criteria decision analysis with a distributed system of conservation practices on the Eagle Creek Watershed in Indiana, USA. Our results show faster and more stable convergence when using an uncertainty-based incremental sampling method than when using a standard random incremental sampling method. This work describes the existing WRESTORE system, provides details about the implementation of our uncertainty-based incremental sampling method, and provides a discussion of our results and future work. The primary contribution of the paper is an uncertainty-based incremental sampling method which can be applied to limited data watershed design problems.

N2  - Recent advancements in information and communication technologies resulted an increase on data produced by the cities. These data are either produced on social media networks or collected by public services and are usually enriched with useful geospatial information. This influx of information coupled with the urge of urban designers to make cities smarter, led to the development of intelligent applications designed to facilitate the everyday lives of citizens. In this demo we present an online platform, Bostonhood, which is responsible for neighborhood recommendation and sustainability assessment. Data came from the official open data hub for the city of Boston, the location-based social network Foursquare and the Airbnb platform. The methodology that we followed combines two different Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis algorithms (COPRAS and TOPSIS) and creates a mutual ranking using the Borda count method. This platform is useful not only to citizens and tourists who want to find the best neighborhood to live in according to selected criteria but also to urban designers who want to improve Boston's sustainability.

N2  - This paper focuses on the multiobjective design optimization of the permanent magnet synchronous linear motors (PMSLMs), which are applied to a high-precision laser engraving machine. A novel efficient multiobjective design optimization method for a PMSLM is proposed to achieve optimal performances as indicated by high average thrust, low thrust ripple, and low total harmonic distortion at different running speeds. First, based on the finite-element analysis (FEA) data, a regression machine learning algorithm, called an extreme learning machine (ELM), is introduced to solve the calculation modeling problem by mapping out the nonlinear and complex relationship between input structural factors and output motor performances. Comparative simulation experiments conducted using the traditional analytical modeling method and another machine learning modeling method, i.e., support vector machine, confirm the superiority of the ELM. Then, a new bionic intelligent optimization algorithm, called the gray wolf optimizer algorithm, is used to search the best optimization performances and structural parameters by performing iteration optimization calculation for multiobjective functions. Finally, FEA and prototype motor experiments prove the effectiveness and validity of the proposed method.

The methodology aims to support a multi-disciplinary team working collaboratively on the development of a mission plan during an expeditionary stability operation. We conducted a case study assessing collaborative understanding and team performance while subject matter experts employed the methodology as a complement to the standard planning process. Results were analyzed using MYRIAD, a preference modeling system that allows combining disparate measures into a coherent assessment capturing several key logical relationships between metrics - ones that may not be modeled using the traditional weighted sum approach. MYRIAD was also used to perform a sensitivity analysis in order to derive from the preference model which aspects of the planning methodology would lead to the greatest overall improvement. Results helped identifying priority areas for future development.

N2  - Pattern classification and its applications are classic domains of study in the area of artificial intelligence. In this study, we integrate neural networks and analytic hierarchy process for the purpose of pattern classification, and showcase the application for the supplier selection problem in the domain of procurement management. Pattern classification has been used for the purpose of supplier base rationalization. In this study, the criteria for decision making have been modeled using fuzzy logic, which further has been modeled as a multi-objective decision making process, by combining the two complementary approaches. The integrated approach drastically reduces the data points required for training and thus extends the applicability of the classifier in the supplier selection domain where the data points is not so high, as is required by classifiers. The proposed integrated approach has been further studied through a case study conducted on a multi-national firm and the results of the analysis have been discussed. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Cloud Computing environment provides an infinite number of resources to Cloud users with different utilities such as computing power, storage space, servers and applications. There are various issues in the cloud resource allocation area that still need to be solved. To address some of these issues, we propose in this paper the DSL-MCDA (Deep Supervised Learning - Multi Criteria Decision Analysis) Model for Energy Consumption-Aware in Cloud Computing as a proactive model of energy consumption-aware. The main goal of the proposed model is to reduce the energy consumption since virtual machines (VM) are dynamically consolidated to lesser number of physical machines (PMs) by selecting an optimal resource that satisfies the demands of cloud users, and this based on classification in deep supervised learning and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods.

N2  - Decision support is required when complex situations arise during product development which takes into account the whole product life cycle. This is especially true when impacted by the ill-defined consequences on the environment in an ever increasingly eco-conscious world. Analytical Hierarchy process (AHP) is one method of providing decision support, and is an instance of a decision support heuristic. Machine learning methods have proved themselves on many well defined problems with clearly defined objectives. In particular, we focus on the recently emerging field of hyper-heuristics which is a blend of human designed heuristics, with the extension of machine designed heuristics. In essence humans can operate at the higher concept or abstract level, while machine heuristics can operate at a lower level. There are a number of issues within the proposed framework, including visualizing a multi-dimensional surface of designs along the Pareto front, as well as dealing with different types of data during the decision making process. It is proposed that Hyper-heuristics, supplemented with other methodologies to deal with vague or missing data, offer a framework in which to begin to address several of the complex compromises that arise during product development.

N2  - The word Cloud has been a buzzword since last few years but there has been lot of confusion happening in the cloud market with respect to selection of best cloud provider at the cheapest prize and achieving the highest resource efficiency for the cloud providers. As now the entire world is moving to achieve goal of becoming SMART PLANET, the technologies like IoT-Internet of Things getting popular and unavoidable in current scenario. As usage of IoT leads to huge collection of data, it certainly requires cloud platform to store the data and perform data analytics and decision making. Recent projects like SMART CITY which involves smart traffic management system, smart waste management system, smart water system etc. would involve various cloud providers offering services & resources and various cloud users using their services. So problem of resource utilization and profit maximization becomes very critical in this scenario. This paper focuses on survey of various auction mechanisms proposed for cloud market to solve the problem of decision making, resource utilization and cost efficiency. It also reviews various decision making models based on MCDM - Multi Criteria Decision Making approach. Very few attempts been made till date to support cloud users decision making process by considering various parameters/requirements. In this paper we are proposing decision making by using models like AHP(Analytical Hierarchy Process) combined with Double Sided Auction to select best cloud provider in an open cloud market with heterogeneous cloud user requirements and healthy competition amongst the cloud providers. In an open cloud market where multiple cloud providers are offering various services at varied cost, it's a very difficult decision for a user to select a best cloud service provider with best cost efficiency matching with various other parameters (like reliability, speed, user experience etc..) The providers also need to achieve best resource efficiency so that sharing/allocation of resources to various users are optimized. As there is no standard process to help user to make a decision, this paper focuses on combining Auction and AHP models together to help cloud users and providers to achieve win-win situation by achieving best resource, time, cost efficiency with heterogeneous environments and demands.

N2  - With the proliferation of outsourcing in global market place, supplier selection has become a key strategic consideration in forming a competitive supply chain. Supplier selection has been recognized as a multi-criteria decision making problem in which suppliers are evaluated according to multiple criteria such as price, quality, delivery and service simultaneously. Facing with excessive pressures from government and customers, increasing number of companies are beginning to consider environmental issues in the procurement and supplier selection process to practice the sustainable development. It is therefore necessary to measure a supplier's environmental performance. This paper aims to find out what kind of environmental criteria can be applied to assess suppliers overall performances. The multi-criteria decision making approach data envelopment analysis (DEA) is applied to help companies to evaluate suppliers' various environmental performance and other capabilities simultaneously. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Data mining techniques and multi criteria decision making techniques have been used widely in many areas, such as customer relationship management, medicine, engineering, education, geographic information systems, and recommendation systems. The present study aims to design a hybrid approach based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and multi criteria decision making. DNNs and multi criteria decision making techniques are integrated with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to improve classification accuracy and deal with large datasets. Three different breast cancer datasets are used for evaluating the performance of the proposed hybrid approach. In most cases, the hybrid approach of applying DNN Backpropagation with three hidden layers and AHP gives better accuracy rate 84.33%, precision 95.9%, recall 86.6%, and F-measure of 90.2% than using one hidden layer or applying DNN Backpropagation with three hidden layers without AHP. In addition, classical classification algorithm are also compared: J48, naïve bayes, and random tree, where they give less results than proposed approach.

N2  - Multicriteria decision analysis evaluates multiple conflicting criteria in decision making, but conflicting criteria are typical in evaluating options. As the existing ordering operations involved in multicriteria decision making cannot easily be implemented with intervals, we assume that scalar representative values with intervals can effectively avoid this issue. To deal with interval-valued criteria, we propose a generalized golden rule representative value approach, which involves the sigmoid function of backpropagation neural networks to tune parameters. Our approach considers the uncertainties and side effects of the interval variables to improve individual scalar representative values. Based on numerical examples, we address the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and we provide a specific application concerning multicriteria decision making with interval criteria satisfaction.

N2  - Multimodal change detection in satellite images is a challenging and complex problem mainly because the local statistics of the images to be compared can be very different. In this paper, we present a novel, reliable and simple change detection operator which is first based on a imaging modality-invariant operator that detects the common specific high-frequency pattern of each structural region existing in the two heterogeneous satellite images. The resultant similarity map is then filtered out by a superpixel-based spatially adaptive filter which increases its reliability against noise. Second, in order to achieve more robustness, changes are then identified, from this similarity map, by combining the results of different automatic thresholding algorithms with a weighted spatially regularized multi-criteria decision analysis. Experimental results involving a mixture of different types of imaging modalities confirm the robustness of the proposed approach.

N2  - The continuous increase in the number of elderly people today poses important challenges for countries as they have to ensure that social and health systems are aligned with the needs of the elderly. In this paper is considered the problem of older adult health monitoring based on IoT monitoring platforms and clinical systems. A large amount of data of a very diverse nature is obtained and this data comes from various sources: wearable sensors, ambient sensors, questionnaires, clinical and para-clinical investigations. This data sources are tools for health parameters monitoring. A better classification of the information achieved from monitoring of the elderly, is presented. A subset of parameters is selected to be monitored in a specific monitoring IoT based system for elderly. In order to obtain weights of parameters a weighting method is chosen from a set of weighting methods. The parameters are evaluated against the selected method. Methods often used for weighting are multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods. Using the weighting method selected, the parameters weights are calculated. The uncertainty resulting from expert's evaluations can be modeled with rough sets. Considering these aspects, a Rough AHP method for weighting parameters is proposed. These weights can be used in data analysis, creating elderly profiles, calculating health indicators and making recommendations.

N2  - The biogas potential of Botswana, a cattle rich nation is explored using dung as a substrate. Biogas could be a good renewable and clean substitute for other forms of energy in rural Botswana, however, the technical and socio-economic potential remains largely unexploited. In this study, the cattle dung was characterized, followed by a lab-scale experiments on the biogas potential yields from the dung. The bio-digester design was selected using the multi criteria decision analysis. From the six digester models that were evaluated for selection, the KVIC was found to be the most suitable with its size ranging from 10 to 100 m3, The bio-digester was subsequently designed using data and mathematical models obtained from literature. The biogas plant was designed for Lemcke's cattle farm, the best selected site, with 5000 herds. The feedstock was found to have an in-situ density of 1410 kg/m3 with a total solids (TS) content of 18.9%, volatile solids (TS) content of 80%. The suitable digester size was found to be 20 m3, An energy audit showed that the plant had a potential to produce a surplus of 45.3 MWh of energy annually.

N2  - Poor visibility by sea fog is a navigational hazard for maritime transport. Due to the lack of observation stations on the sea, monitoring large-scale sea fog and assessing navigation risk in foggy season are challenges. Thus, the paper introduced MODIS data for monitoring sea fog and proposed an approach of assessing navigation risk along fairway during foggy season. Sea fog is firstly identified from MODIS images using supervised classifier and then navigation risk along fairway is quantitatively evaluated by means of spatial analysis. Using GIS based Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model, a risk index layer is respectively constructed for various marine environmental factors, which include sea fog, wind, wave and etc. and these risk index layers eventually are integrated into navigation risk assessment layer through the order weighted average (OWA) operator.

N2  - Personalized recommendation and the processing of real-time data exemplify the processing of massive data which in the field of Internet-of-Things (IoT) received a great extent of attention in recent literature. The incompleteness of massive data in the IoT is widespread. Obtaining personalized information from the incomplete data set is still puzzled by searching efficient and accurate methods at present. Skyline query is a widely used data processing method, especially in the field of multi-objective decision analysis and data visualization. To eliminate the negative effects on massive data processing in IoT, a novel skyline preference query strategy based on massive and the incomplete data set is proposed in this paper. This strategy simply separates and divides massive and incomplete data set into two parts according to dimension importance and executes skyline query, respectively. The strategy mainly resolves the problem of extracting personalized information from massive and incomplete data set and improves the efficiency of skyline query on massive and incomplete data set. First, this paper presents a skyline preference query strategy based on strict clustering and implements it on dimensions that have higher importance. Second, a skyline preference query strategy based on loose clustering is implemented on dimensions that have lower importance. Finally, integrating local skyline query results, this paper calculates global skyline query results by using information entropy theory. The efficiency and effectiveness of Skyline Preference Query (SPQ) algorithm have been evaluated in terms of response time and result set size through the comparative experiments with ISkyline algorithm and sort-based incomplete data skyline algorithm. A large number of simulation results show that the efficiency of SPQ algorithm is higher than that of other common methods.

N2  - The growing needs of emerging big data applications has posed significant challenges for the design of optimized manycore systems. Network-on-Chip (NoC) enables the integration of a large number of processing elements (PEs) in a single die. To design optimized manycore systems, we need to establish suitable trade-offs among multiple objectives including power, performance, and thermal. Therefore, we consider multi-objective design space exploration problems arising in the design of NoC-enabled manycore systems: placement of PEs and communication links to optimize two or more objectives (e.g., latency, energy, and throughput). Existing algorithms suffer from scalability and accuracy challenges as size of the design space and the number of objectives grow. In this paper, we propose a novel framework referred as Guided Design Space Exploration (Guided-DSE) that performs adaptive design space exploration using a data-driven model to improve the speed and accuracy of multi-objective design optimization process. We provide two concrete instantiations of guided-DSE and present results to show their efficacy for designing 3D heterogeneous manycore systems.

N2  - This paper proposes a multicriteria design optimization methodology for permanent magnet (PM) motors used in electric vehicle (EV) applications. In the process, an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is utilized, coupled with a multiobjective optimization algorithm, as a surrogate model of the electric motor. This allows for the consideration of the full drive cycle and respective efficiency map for every motor design. The prediction error of the ANFIS is minimized by employing appropriate membership functions, initial training data, and an adaptive learning scheme via iterative training. The efficiency map is then implemented in a vehicle dynamic model to compute the total consumed energy over the driving cycle. The optimization profile accounts for total energy efficiency, torque density, and additionally considers complementary design criteria via an a posteriori selection procedure on the resulting Pareto set. The methodology developed is applied to optimize a surface PM motor with concentrated fractional slot winding, mounted on a light EV that competes in fuel economy races. The selected motor design has been validated through measurements on a prototype.

N2  - To support adaptivity of data parallel applications on multi-core platforms, we propose a framework based on the combination of OpenCL application auto-tuning and run-time resource management. The framework addresses computationally intensive multimedia OpenCL applications. For these target applications, we show that application auto-tuning, based on design-time analysis, can become synergistic with run-time resource management. In the proposed framework, run-time decisions are taken by each application, autonomously, to achieve system adaptivity. This paper describes the methodology and related toolchain, defined during the 2PARMA European project, based on the integration of independent tools to provide effective compilation of OpenCL code, multi-objective design space exploration, application monitoring and tuning and system-wide run-time resource management. Experimental results are reported for design optimization of an OpenCL stereo-matching application and then for a resource contention scenario where multiple stereo-matching applications are executed on the same platform with different run-time requirements.

N2  - The importance of dominance and skyline analysis has been well recognized in multicriteria decision-making applications. Most previous studies focus on how to help customers find a set of "best" possible products from a pool of given products. In this paper, we identify an interesting problem, finding top-k preferable products, which has not been studied before. Given a set of products in the existing market, we want to find a set of k "best" possible products such that these new products are not dominated by the products in the existing market. We study two problem instances of finding top-k preferable products. In the first problem instance, we need to set the prices of these products such that the total profit is maximized. We refer such products as top-k profitable products. In the second problem instance, we want to find k products such that these k products can attract the greatest number of customers. We refer these products as top-k products. In both problem instances, a straightforward solution is to enumerate all possible subsets of size k and find the subset which gives the greatest profit (for the first problem instance) or attracts the greatest number of customers (for the second problem instance). However, there are an exponential number of possible subsets. In this paper, we propose solutions to find the top-k profitable products and the top-k popular products efficiently. An extensive performance study using both synthetic and real data sets is reported to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed algorithms. © 2012 IEEE.

N2  - Multi-objective optimization yields indispensable information about the best possible design trade-offs of an antenna structure, yet it is challenging if full-wave electromagnetic (EM) analysis is utilized for performance evaluation. The latter is a necessity for majority of contemporary antennas as it is the only way of achieving acceptable modeling accuracy. In this paper, a procedure for accelerated multi-objective design of antennas is proposed that exploits fast data-driven surrogates constructed at the level of coarse-discretization EM simulations, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to yield an initial approximation of the Pareto set, and response correction methods for design refinement (i.e., elevating the selected Pareto-optimal designs to the high-fidelity EM simulation model level). To reduce the computational cost of setting up the surrogate, the relevant part of the design space (i.e., the part containing the Pareto front) is first identified through a series of single-objective optimization runs and subsequently represented by a set of adjacent compartments with separate surrogate models established within them. This segmentation process dramatically reduces the number of training samples necessary to build an accurate model thus limiting the overall optimization cost. Our approach is demonstrated using a UWB monopole antenna and compared to a state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted technique that does not use domain segmentation.

N2  - The main objective of an academic conference is the participant's scope of submitting research papers. Different types of academic institutions and organizations arrange many academic conferences annually. It is virtually impossible for academics to attend all the conferences. Consequently, selection of the best conference is of utmost importance for academics. Selection of best conference paper was dependent on significant factors such as: conference location, registration fee, conference language, subject of the conference and submission deadline. In this research paper, Analytic Network Process (ANP) was used to accurately rank ten significant academic conferences based on the specific criteria mentioned above. Machine Learning (ML) algorithm have been used to rank upcoming conferences. The upcoming conferences will be considered based on the condition that the machine learning scores should be more than 80%. Multiple linear regression machine learning algorithm was used to find out the best upcoming academic conference.

N2  - Telemedicine is increasingly used in the modern health care system because it provides health care services to patients amidst distant locations. However, the prioritisation process for patients with multiple chronic diseases (MCDs) over telemedicine is becoming increasingly complex due to diverse and big data generated from multiple disease conditions. To solve such a problem, massive datasets must be collected, and high velocity must be acquired, specifically in real-time processing. This process requires decision-making (DM) regarding the emergency degree of each chronic disease for every patient. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches (i.e. direct aggregation, distance measurement and compromise ranking) are the main solutions for dealing with this complex situation. However, each MCDM approach provides a unique rank from those of other methods. By far, the preferred DM approach that can provide an ideal rank better than other approaches has not been established. This study proposes an extension of the technique for reorganising opinion order to interval levels (TROOIL). Such an extension is called Hybrid DM and Voting Method (HDMVM) which is based on different DM approaches (i.e. direct aggregation, distance measurement and compromise ranking). HDMVM is used to prioritise big data of patients with MCDs in real-time through the remote health-monitoring procedure. In this paper, we propose a methodology that is based on three sequential stages. The first stage illustrates how the big data of patients with MCDs can be recognised in the telemedicine environment and identifies the target telemedicine tier in this study. The second stage describes the steps of the proposed HDMVM sequentially. The third stage applies the proposed method by prioritising the case study of big data of patients with MCDs based on the above DM approaches. Moreover, dataset of remote patients with MCDs ( n = 500 ) is adopted, which contains three diseases, namely, chronic heart diseases and high and low blood pressures. The prioritisation results vary among direct aggregation, distance measurement and compromise approaches. The proposed HDMVM effectively provides a uniform and final ranking result for big data of patients with MCDs. A statistical method (i.e. mean) is performed to objectively validate the ranking results. Significant differences between the scores of the groups are identified in the objective validation, signifying identical ranking results. The evaluation of the proposed work with the benchmark study indicates that this study has tackled issues relevant to big data and diversity of MCDM approaches in the prioritisation of patients with MCDs.

N2  - Interactive ranking techniques have substantially promoted analysts' ability in making judicious and informed decisions effectively based on multiple criteria. However, the existing techniques cannot satisfactorily support the analysis tasks involved in ranking large-scale spatial alternatives, such as selecting optimal locations for chain stores, where the complex spatial contexts involved are essential to the decision-making process. Limitations observed in the prior attempts of integrating rankings with spatial contexts motivate us to develop a context-integrated visual ranking technique. Based on a set of generic design requirements we summarized by collaborating with domain experts, we propose SRVis, a novel spatial ranking visualization technique that supports efficient spatial multi-criteria decision-making processes by addressing three major challenges in the aforementioned context integration, namely, a) the presentation of spatial rankings and contexts, b) the scalability of rankings' visual representations, and c) the analysis of context-integrated spatial rankings. Specifically, we encode massive rankings and their cause with scalable matrix-based visualizations and stacked bar charts based on a novel two-phase optimization framework that minimizes the information loss, and the flexible spatial filtering and intuitive comparative analysis are adopted to enable the in-depth evaluation of the rankings and assist users in selecting the best spatial alternative. The effectiveness of the proposed technique has been evaluated and demonstrated with an empirical study of optimization methods, two case studies, and expert interviews.

N2  - Geographic location selection for river bridge construction is one of the most challenging tasks because it has to deal with both numerical data and qualitative information with uncertainty. Organizational self-assessment, ensuring safety, risk measurement, supplier appraisal and many other things depend on a proper Geo-location selection. River bridge site selection is such an example in which multiple attributes; both qualitative and quantitative criteria have to be analyzed for selecting a proper bridge location. This paper demonstrates the application of a novel method named Evidential Reasoning (ER), which is a Multi Criteria Decision Analysis method applied for decision making where many criteria have to be explicitly considered for making decision. ER approach is capable for addressing the uncertainty of multi-criteria decision problem, where there exist factors of both subjective and quantitative nature. It handles uncertainties by using a degree belief structure. The evidential reasoning approach helps in aggregating degree of belief from lower level attributes to higher level attributes. To conduct the experiments of this work, Geo-location selection for The Padma Bridge construction in Bangladesh is taken as research domain and the experiment results and analysis are discussed in this paper.

N2  - Aquaculture has been developed rapidly over the last two decades and had become an important economy for Malaysia. The amount of local oyster has become less due to flood, oil leaks, and disease factors and reduced water quality. The current conventional method used Department of Fisheries (DOF), Marang in monitoring water quality criteria such as salinity, water depth, and water movement is not only time consuming but also costly and not practical at large area. Therefore, this study investigates the potential of GIS-based multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) in selecting the suitable and new area for oyster aquaculture. It contains a set of evaluation criteria which are quantifiable indicators of the extent to which decision objectives are realized. The selected criteria are ammoniacal nitrogen, water depth, water pH, level dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature and water movement. The result showed the spatial characteristic potential area of oyster aquaculture breeding are good water pH (7-8), water depth (3-4m), level dissolved oxygen (4-5 p.p.m) and good salinity (20-30 p.p.t) on mussel existing aquaculture site. Therefore, the classification of geographical information system (GIS) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) analysis could be used by Local Department of Fisheries (DOF) to find systematically new sites for oyster aquaculture. The suitable spatial area could be improved by using advanced techniques and other data parameters such as constraints, stream and social economic to get more significant results of oyster aquaculture breeding in the study area. © 2014 IEEE.

N2  - A common strategy in Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is to rank alternative solutions by weighted summary scores. Weights, however, are often abstract to the decision maker and can only be set by vague intuition. While previous work supports a point-wise exploration of weight spaces, we argue that MCDM can benefit from a regional and global visual analysis of weight spaces. Our main contribution is WeightLifter, a novel interactive visualization technique for weight-based MCDM that facilitates the exploration of weight spaces with up to ten criteria. Our technique enables users to better understand the sensitivity of a decision to changes of weights, to efficiently localize weight regions where a given solution ranks high, and to filter out solutions which do not rank high enough for any plausible combination of weights. We provide a comprehensive requirement analysis for weight-based MCDM and describe an interactive workflow that meets these requirements. For evaluation, we describe a usage scenario of WeightLifter in automotive engineering and report qualitative feedback from users of a deployed version as well as preliminary feedback from decision makers in multiple domains. This feedback confirms that WeightLifter increases both the efficiency of weight-based MCDM and the awareness of uncertainty in the ultimate decisions.

N2  - Hydroelectric generation is comprised of complex systems specifically designed to meet the dynamic load. Forced outages and unscheduled maintenance activities severely limit the generation output and oftentimes create undesired environmental effects within the immediate Dam/Reservoir area as well as the downstream surroundings. The introduction of multivariate descriptive data analysis and multi-criteria decision making in the maintenance sphere of hydroelectric generation are designed to eliminate reactive preservation methodologies while economically dispatching the unit. Moreover, the implementation of a correlation matrix for powertrain and auxiliary electrical systems produce a general method to localize the outage cause to a component level. Statistical regression techniques were used to evaluate the differences of inconsistencies between maintenance practices and theoretical systematic preservation methods experienced in the hydroelectric generation industry. The regression forecasting model minimizes the risks typically encountered in systems maintenance and prioritizes capital-intense projects within the power production envelope. Additionally, the application will assist the decision-makers with systematic and orderly ranking of projects competing for scarce resources (labor, material, and funding) over a multi-year period in a constrained power production environment. The identification of inadequate performing assets and its cost effectiveness throughout the electrical footprint is an important tenet of the program.

As multi-core architectures have gone mainstream, we present a new parallel skyline query algorithm that can be applied to multi-core and multiprocessor systems, to progressively return skyline points as they are identified efficiently. In this paper, we proposed a parallel skyline algorithm which can eliminate redundant computations and improve parallelism of the skyline query. Experimental results show that our algorithm successfully exploits the features of multiple cores to improve the performance of skyline computation for large high-dimensional datasets.

This paper proposes to use a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis technique, TOPSIS for ranking suppliers. Modified Triangular Fuzzy TOPSIS is proposed for ranking the suppliers. However the novelty of this paper lies in the treatment of the criteria as considered in this paper. Some of the criteria are considered to be essential and thus are used always. The uses of the remaining criteria are probabilistic since they may or may not be used depending on the situation and the set of alternative suppliers considered. A numerical problem shows the successful application of such idea and shows that such idea can be implemented.

N2  - The skyline of a data point set is made up of the best points in the set, and is very important for multi-criteria decision making. In these years, the skyline problem attracts more and more attention, and many variants of the traditional skyline emerge in the database field. One recent and important variant is group-based skyline, which aims to find the best groups of points in a given set. In this paper, we bring forward an efficient approach, called minimum dominance search (MDS), to solve the g-skyline problem, a latest group-based skyline problem. MDS consists of two steps: In the first step, we construct a novel g-skyline support structure, i.e., minimum dominance graph (MDG), which proves to be a minimum g-skyline support structure. In the second step, we search for g-skyline groups based on the MDG through two searching algorithms, and a skyline-combination based optimization strategy is employed to improve these two algorithms. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets, and show that our algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art in most cases.

N2  - It is well established that making decisions from defined data according to various criteria requires the use of MultiCriteria Decision Aiding or Analysis (MCDA) methods. However the necessary input data for these approaches are often ill-known especially when the data are a priori estimated. The common MCDA approaches consider these data as singular/scalar values. This paper deals with the consideration of more realistic, values by studying the impact of imprecision on a classical 'precise' ranking established with ACUTA, a method based on additive utilities. We propose a generic approach to establish the concordance of pairwise relations of preference despite interval-based imprecision by complementing ACUTA with a computation of Kendall's index of concordance and of a threshold for maintaining this concordance. The methodology is applied to an industrial case subjected to Sustainable Development problems.

N2  - Population growth has an impact on increasing living needs, including the need for building materials. The high demand for building materials will spur the increase in mining activities, especially in Kediri Regency as the largest Pasir Batu producing district in East Java Province. On the other hand this industry also creates environmental changes that threaten the sustainability of environmental functions and the socio-cultural life. This was compounded by the lack of careful consideration in assessing the potential area for mining exploration by Pasir Batu. This paper proposes to determine the potential zone of Batu Pasir mining based on the specified criteria. Criteria are based on the definition of Mining and Exploration in UU Republik Indonesia 4/2009. The criteria used are grouped into 3 categories. First, natural factors consist of morphology, lithology, hydrology, vegetation and wild nature. Second, man-made factors include safe distance from the main road, settlement distance and population density.Third, aesthetic factors consist of natural elements and tourist locations. The research method used is the integration of Geographic Information System (GIS) with the calculation of Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) using the AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method, Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis (MOORA) and Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS). GIS is used for data integration so that the determination of zoning is visual and easier to understand. The AHP method is used to determine the weighting of each criterion. The results of weighting the criteria serve as the basis for ranking alternative locations between the MOORA and COPRAS methods. The final outcome shows that two methods have a slightly different weight rank, but the COPRAS method is more stable and complex.The judgement is very influential in the selection of criteria and deliberate hierarchy to determine the significance of each criterion on the weighting of criteria.

N2  - By considering the growing demand for energy supply and increment in fossil fuel consumption which are accelerated by population growth, attentions have been focused on Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The corresponding environmental corollaries are another motivation to further follow this aim. Solar energy is willingly assented to be a reliable source in this regard. There are well-cited researches investigating about enhancing the efficiency of RESs particularly solar energy. Geographical and climatic conditions are crucial factors in designing a promising solar project. There are diverse approaches to optimize the energy planning systems. Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) analysis is a well-known approach employed for assessing the energy systems so as to find the most optimum case. There are several attempts applying different types of MCDM analysis in the pertinent literature. In this study, it has been managed to find the best approach for priority analysis of solar projects. Three major types of MCDM approaches have been evaluated including VIKOR, SAW and TOPSIS. The evaluation has been conducted in Iran as a high potential country in solar irradiation. In order to find the best approach, twenty five locations have been selected in deferent parts of the country with diverse climatic conditions. Furthermore, the considered criteria are technical, economic and environment ones which have been weighted through Entropy-Shannon methodology. The Methods have been evaluated by comparing with Data Envelopment Analysis result and applying a sensitivity analysis to the considered weights. It has been concluded that MCDM approaches are reliable methods for priority analysis and SAW is performing better comparing with other methods.

N2  - Skyline is widely used in multi-objective decision-making, data visualization and other fields. With the rapid increasing of data volume, skyline of big data has also attracted more and more attention. However, skyline of big data has its own shortcomings. When the dimension increases, skyline results will be numerous, and we would like to select k points from the result sets. In this paper, we propose the top-k skyline of big data. It is a Top-k Skyline Method in MapReduce, called MR-DMKS. Firstly, we convert the multidimensional data to a single value to determine the dominance relationship of two data points. Secondly, we calculate the score by using the converted values. Thirdly, sort the data points more efficiently and accurately according to the scores using a window queue. Finally, we choose k data objects having the strongest dominating capacity. A large number of experiments show that our method is effective, and has good flexibility and scalability on real data sets as well as synthetic data sets.

N2  - In this paper, we formulate a multi-criteria decision problem using a reproducing kernel Hilbert space approach to stochastic processes applied to a wholesale electrical power market. Our approach provides an alternative to stochastic, robust optimization commonly used in recent years in that we consider a range of uncertainty rather than just the most likely case or worst case scenario. In particular, we model operation of the electricity market of the ISO New England, an independent Regional Transmission Organization serving the New England area, using hourly zonal data for the last five years. Alternative investments in production or infrastructure must be evaluated in an environment of risk and Knightian uncertainty. Assuming that performance is modeled as a random function of deterministic but uncertain demand allows risk to be measured by value at risk curves over a range of uncertain demand. The preferred investment is determined by a preference rule defined on the set of value at risk curves, a standard multi-criteria approach.

N2  - Cloud computing is the expansion of parallel computing, distributed computing. The technology of cloud computing becomes more and more widely used, and one of the fundamental issues in this cloud environment is related to task scheduling. However, scheduling in Cloud environments represents a difficult issue since it is basically NP-complete. Thus, many variants based on approximation techniques, especially those inspired by Swarm Intelligence (SI) have been proposed. This paper proposes a machine learning algorithm to guide the cloud choose the scheduling technique by using multi criteria decision to optimize the performance. The main contribution of our work is to minimize the makespan of a given task set. The new strategy is simulated using the CloudSim toolkit package where the impact of the algorithm is checked with different numbers of VMs varying from 2 to 50, and different task sizes between 30 bytes and 2700 bytes. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm minimizes the execution time and the makespan between 7% and 75%, and improves the performance of the load balancing scheduling.

N2  - Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has been used widely to guide decision making in multi-attribute selection problems. Few studies have however proposed the use of combinations of MCDA approaches with goal-oriented modeling to rank design alternatives related to business process models. We propose a distance-based approach for models specified with the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL) that guides the selection of alternatives, with a focus on business process integration. This approach, named DbGRL, exploits the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique and the Technique of Order Preference Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for building and analyzing GRL models. DbGRL provides stakeholders/decision-makers with insights into the changes needed in the GRL model or related (process) models to achieve desired outcomes. It also identifies ideal and anti-ideal points used to investigate how close or how far the alternatives are from those points. This paper presents DbGRL and its usage with a simple but realistic healthcare-related example where results are promising. DbGRL's expected benefits and limitations are also discussed.

N2  - An analytical design model is presented for a salient hybrid synchronous machine topology that utilizes both a field winding and permanent magnets (PMs). The model is designed to be used in a multi-objective design process to establish the trade-off between mass and loss. Within the model, the field distribution as well as qd-axis model parameters are established from design data, containing material properties, stator and rotor geometries, and winding layout. The calculated parameters include resistances, inductances, and the back-emf of the machine. The model is validated by comparing predicted results with those obtained using finite element analysis (FEA). © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Data management used in a cloud environment is always challenging. Data replication is a well-known data management technique that has been commonly adopted by cloud systems as an effective solution to achieve good performance in terms of response time, load balancing and most importantly, high data availability and reliability. To maximize the benefit of data replication, replicas placement and replacement in the system is critical. Several replica placement strategies have been proposed in the literature; some of them were based on criteria such as: mean service time, failure probability, load variance, latency, storage usage and other. For each criterion is assigned a weight by the user which reflects the importance of each criterion. We propose in this paper an original approach based on a multi-criteria decision analysis model called ELECTRE-I (ELimination and Choice Expressing REality). This modeling allows us to improve the selection of the candidate site for replica placement, which have a good impact on the simulation results, and improve performances.

N2  - In decision making most approaches are taking into account objective criteria, however the subjective correlation among decision makers provided as preference utility is necessary to be presented to provide confidence preference additive among decision makers reducing ambiguity and produce better utility preferences measurement for subjective criteria among decision makers. Most models in Decision support systems are assuming criteria as independent. Therefore, these models are ranking alternatives based on objective data analysis. Also, different type of data (time series, linguistic values, interval data, etc.) imposes some difficulties to do decision making using classical multi criteria decision making models.

N2  - Security requirements applicable to the Internet of Things (IoT) should aim to ensure integrity, authenticity and authorization, confidentiality/privacy, nonrepudiation, and last but not least, availability. Classic data analysis algorithms are no longer valid for assuring security at all levels and a new approach to data sciences is required, which would consider the complex heterogeneous nature of the IoT, taking also into consideration, its potential to deploy cross layer for security assessment mechanisms. Furthermore, data collected from sensors should be processed and analyzed nearly in real time. The classical algorithms have two main drawbacks: 1) they deal with unidimensional data and 2) they fail to assume limited information available in the stream data processing. In this article, new solutions are discussed and presented that detect anomalies in data streams nearly in real time. Specifically, we propose: 1) an event detection method used in unidimensional data streams and relying on the event strength function, which is an extension of the typical 'True or False' decision-making scheme; 2) multiple-criteria event detection approaches based on the Dynamic Pareto Set, introducing a time-depending decision set; and 3) an anomaly detection method based on multicriteria temporal graphs, combining the dynamics of decision making and multicriteria. All the proposed algorithms are presented by means of their formal description and are illustrated with examples.

N2  - Recent developments in electric vehicle technology have lead to an increase in the use of electric vehicles. With the increase in the use of electric vehicles, it is necessary to secure the information and money flow in the process from production to consumption. In this study, an energy ecosystem in the Ethereum Blockchain network, which records all processes from the generation of electricity to the end user, is designed. Furthermore, this study includes energy producers, consumers, distributors, dealers, electric charge station and electric vehicle users. Transactions between users are provided using smart contracts. Smart contracts eliminate third-party contacts and all transactions with the decentralized application created are recorded on the Blockchain network. Recorded transactions are maintained in accordance with the principles of confidentiality, integrity and availability through Blockchain and smart contracts. In the application developed with the use of smart contracts, the user can access information such as location, price list, payment type, charging mode, charging type and plug types of the related charging stations. PROMETHEE, which is a multi-criteria decision-making method, is used in case there is more than one offer suitable for a user request. In this method, the weights required for the criteria are determined according to the profile of a user.

N2  - In real-time applications, the information system may often evolves over time. Dynamic information processing is one of main challenges in the research fields related to information processing. Rough sets theory is an excellent information processing tool which has been applied in dynamic information processing researches in recent years. Dominance-based rough sets approach is an outstanding generation of rough sets theory, which can process the ordered information related to the problems of multi-criteria decision analysis and multi-criteria sort. In this article, we investigate some new strategies to unleash the performance of updating approximations in dominance-based rough sets approach further. An original concept of coarse boundary of approximations is given, which can be applied to prune more unnecessary computation in updating approximations further. Then a new incremental approach for updating approximations under a dominance relation is proposed and the corresponding algorithm is designed. A numeric illustration shows the feasibility of the approach. By extensive experimental estimation, the performance of the approach outperforms that of its counterpart on the computational time.

N2  - Since the reform and opening-up, the society and economy of China has rapidly developing, and the living standard of person has been greatly improved. However, along with the rapid economic development, China is facing a series of environmental problems such as ecological destruction, environmental pollution and land degradation etc.. It is essential to conduct an in-depth research on the existing environmental problems in China. According to the carrying capacity assessment of land and resources, using multi-source remote sensing data such as MODIS data, nighttime light data as well as the socio-economic statistics and meteorological data from 2002 to 2013, the evaluation model of the national ecological environmental quality is established based on the combination of multi-criteria decision-making algorithms and principal component analysis. The assessment model of ecological environmental quality is verified by comparing the evaluation results of two different models: environmental performance index, ecological carrying capacity and eco-environmental quality index. All of results have shown a downward trend. Lastly, the better relationship between the ecological environmental quality and the ecological carrying capacity is established. The R-squared reaches 0.5023 and the correlation coefficient reaches 0.7087, which reveals the reliability and scientificity of the ecological environmental quality assessment model of China constructed in this study. The results show that the quality of ecological environment in China shows a downward trend in general. The area of the eco-environmental quality index between 0.6-0.8 performs a downward trend temporally, and then it decreased to the value between 0.4-0.6. The boundary between 0.4-0.6 and 0.6-0.8 spread southward.

N2  - Pavement industry is very critical for any public authority looking after the safety and comfort of its citizens because it is the backbone of many transportation networks. Studying the factors that affect the pavement performance is essential to increase the lifetime of pavement. The objective of this article is to identify the factors that affect pavement performance and rank their effect. From a detailed literature review, 29 factors are identified and a questionnaire is developed to examine perceptions of the industry professionals about the importance of each factor on pavement performance. A total number of 205 completed responses are collected. The collected data are analyzed by relative importance index and a multicriteria decision-making method, analytic network process. Based on the data analysis, it is found that the most three significant factors are related to surface conditions, namely, "high percentage of cracks," "extremely rough road surface," and "high rut depth." The outcome of this article will help the professionals in the pavement industry to improve pavement performance, extend the expected pavement life cycle, and reduce the maintenance requirements.

N2  - This study presents a novel two-stage solution method designed for sustainable last-mile delivery systems in urban areas. A proposed hybrid solution methodology includes multi-criteria decision-making system to select the most efficient logistics providers by considering different performance indicators, and a mixed-integer linear optimization model for last-mile cargo distributions by drones within metropolitan areas. We present a multi-objective modeling approach by considering time windows for customer services and charging operations of drones and outline important characteristics of the mathematical programming problem to minimize transportation cost (in the meantime carbon dioxide emissions) and total sustainability score of the system by using epsilon constraint method to find out the Pareto frontiers. The main novelty of the proposed solution methodology is the inclusion of many performance indicators of last-mile delivery systems into multi-objective models for design of a sustainable city logistics. Additionally, the proposed model is applied to an illustrative case by using real-life data of one of the metropolitan in Turkey. The approach is shown as comparative analysis of proposed method with other two state-of-art solution methodologies for multi-objective problems, after defining some pre-processing, symmetry breaking steps, valid inequalities, and logic cuts.

N2  - While it is well understood that the Internet of things (IoT) can facilitate numerous applications (e.g., environmental supervision, forest fire prevention and Intelligent farming), it also brings a significant challenge for efficiently selecting sensors that meet users' preference and specific requirement from millions of heterogeneous sensors. In this paper, we propose an improved fast nondominated sorting algorithm for efficiently preference-based sensor selection in IoT. Specifically, this proposed method mainly includes three parts: 1) Offline constructing R-tree to search sensor resources and narrowing the size of dataset according to user's preference; 2) Using an improved fast nondominated sorting approach to get nondominated front; 3) Employing TOPSIS to characterize every sensor option of the nondominated front. In order to illustrate the usability of the model, we conduct experiments on several simulation datasets. Experimental results show that this method outperforms several baselines in terms of both response time and accuracy.

N2  - Illegal tapping of fuel pipelines has recently become one of the most relevant safety problems faced by the industry. Hundreds of illegal interventions have been reported around the world, causing a significant number of deaths, relevant impacts on the environment, and capital loss. Therefore, it is important to develop systems that are able to detect such scenarios at an early stage, enabling a fast counteract. To this end, machine learning algorithms can train models on available data for detecting future issues. Most recently, ensemble learning and dynamic classifier selection (DCS) techniques have been achieving promising results in supervised learning tasks. Such models are usually trained based on a single criterion. However, it is desirable to take into account both the number of false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) for the illegal tapping detection task, since they are conflicting and both lead to financial losses and/or accidents. Therefore, this work proposes a novel DCS technique based on multiple criteria, namely overall local class-specific accuracy (OLCA), which employs multi-criteria decision making for dynamically selecting the best classifier for a new sample given the local true positive and negative ratios. A numerical experiment is conducted for assessing the generalization performance of the proposed method in an oil pipeline, with the goal of detecting illegal taping using pressure transient signals. Results show that OLCA is able to reduce the number of both FP and FN when dynamically selecting the classifiers of a baseline Random Forest ensemble.

N2  - The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) has identified the West Water Street corridor in downtown Charlottesville as an area of focus for bicyclist safety due to a high rate of pedestrian crashes between 2012 and 2016. Water Street hosts one of the main bicycle routes in the city; however, there is a high level of traffic stress for bicyclists. Therefore, it is critical to determine pedestrian and bicyclist safety countermeasures. Ideally, Water Street would be able to accommodate vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists in a safe and efficient manner. The focus of this project is to research, create, and test alternative roadway designs to improve bicyclist and pedestrian safety in the Water Street corridor. The design team analyzes best practices from other bicycle-and pedestrian-friendly cities to inspire design ideas for the specific Water Street corridor. Multi-criteria decision analysis is used to choose the best design concept. This one concept is then extrapolated to other similar designs in which one aspect of the main design alternative is changed. The team tests those designs using a virtual reality (VR) environment and biometric data collection. The team is currently (February 2020) starting to conduct experiments in the VR environment. A user testing plan is being created and reviewed that will then be executed in March 2020 to conduct experiments. User comfort and safety will be evaluated across four different design alternatives. From this evaluation, a recommendation will be proposed to the City of Charlottesville as to what design should be implemented.

N2  - We present a new algorithm capable of partitioning sets of objects by taking simultaneously into account their relational descriptions given by multiple dissimilarity matrices. The algorithm uses a nonlinear aggregation criterion, weighted Tchebycheff distances, more appropriate than linear combinations (such as weighted averages) for the construction of compromise solutions. We obtain a partition of the set of objects, the prototype of each cluster and a weight vector that indicates the relevance of each criterion in each cluster. Since this is a clustering algorithm for relational data, it is compatible with any distance function used to measure the dissimilarity between objects. Some practical applications are shown, the good results obtained indicate the interest of the presented algorithm. © 2012 IEEE.

N2  - The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) technology brings many new opportunities for applications in areas including smart healthcare, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. These applications must normally distribute the computations, required for extracting value from sensor data, over the IoT infrastructure platforms (e.g., sensors, phones, field-gateways, and clouds). This can be very challenging for IoT application developers due to the heterogeneity of the aforementioned platforms, potentially conflicting nonfunctional requirements (e.g., battery power, latency, and cost), and related deployment criteria, which is impossible to resolve manually. To address the above challenges, we have developed the PATH2iot framework that decomposes a complex IoT application into self-contained micro-operations. Based on the deployment criteria, PATH2iot automatically distributes the set of micro-operations across IoT infrastructure platforms, while respecting their run-time data and control flow dependencies. In our previous work, we have shown how to use the PATH2iot to optimize the battery life of a healthcare wearable. In this article, we describe a new research that significantly extends PATH2iot, which introduces a heuristic model capable of making optimal deployment decisions based on multiple conflicting nonfunctional requirements and selection criteria (user preferences). It does so by leveraging a well-known multicriteria decision-making method called the analytic hierarchical processes (AHP). The applicability of the deployment model is validated based on a real-world digital healthcare analytics use case. The results show that our model is able to find the optimal deployment solution for different user preferences.

N2  - With the increase in volume, heterogeneity and uncertainty in data, conventional analytics approaches for monitoring users behavior in organisations are no longer sufficient for the effective and reliable detection of malicious activities. This motivates the need for introducing additional analysis techniques. This paper introduces an intelligent fusion method based on fuzzy aggregation functions typically utilized in multi-criteria decision making. The proposed method, which can be integrated with analytics systems, undertakes temporal and multi-criteria fusion processes on pre-analyzed data, to enhance effective monitoring and decision-making. An application to a prominent area of research in the cyber-security domain, the insider threat problem, is shown to validate the usefulness of our method.

N2  - Student academic evaluation is part of the learning process in order to control the student's learning progress. The evaluation will show whether the student will pass or fail and for an instructor to guide for future evaluations on performance. There are criteria such as student's gender, student's age when they are registered in university, student's 1st semester GPA, etc., which exist in academic data can be utilized to get the student academic performance using multicriteria decision making. Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis (MOORA) and Simple Multi-Attribute Rating (SMART) was two simple technique in multi-criteria decision making that the criteria weight can be determined objectively using entropy and gain values. This paper tries to evaluate the student academic performance using MOORA and SMART with criteria weight and sub-criteria weight resulted from entropy and gain. Decision output out of MOORA and SMART then compared with actual data using confusion matrix to discover the performance of those criteria and sub-criteria weight. The result showed that the performance of criteria weight with accuracy was 60.9 percent and the criteria of fourth-grade point average have the biggest impact on student academic evaluation with 0.1589 of weight. The result of this research can be used to help the instructor to determine the weight of student criteria for future recommendations and evaluations on student performance.

N2  - This paper is intended to provide better insight into Geographical
Information System especially from geospatial technical development
perspective. It includes brief introduction into GIS and Remote Sensing.
Start from early development GIS as a desktop computing, it has been
proved as a power tool in planning and decision making process. It has
been able to provide timely accurate and timely information. The
strength of GIS in early development is laid on the capability of GIS
and Remote Sensing in modelling, analyzing spatial relationships of
complex active process, multi criteria decision making and predict
spatial object distribution. The overlaying techniques in determining
and classifying the underlying process, geographical object has been
ever really amazing. In this regard, simultaneously GIS is able to
produce information in the form of texts, tabular, chart, thematic and
chlorotic map visualization. This capacity is due to a strong component
of GIS software which include database management, photogrammetric,
geoinformatic engineering, cartographic techniques, word processor and
mathematical calculator that are embedded in the GIS Software. Because
of these components, GIS is not only able to answer question of what but
also to answer question of where. In this regard every geographical
object is described by attributes and geometric aspect of the underlying
objects. This allows the possibility to detect and to trace the location
of static and mobile geographical obj ects.
In early ninety, the strength of GIS has been increased by incorporating
3 D modelling for digital terrain model, landscape, and geomorphology or
earth surface and built environment including urban city, road
development. In addition to this ninety development, Civil Engineering,
Public Health, Mining, Flight Company, City Council, Ministry of Defend,
Ministry of transportation, Highway management have been also explored
and used. During this period the question of quality information handled
and produced by GIS has been big issue. Through intensive research data
quality parameters and frameworks, standards, produced by Open GIS
Consortium have been also incorporated into GIS. In Malaysia there are
several GIS and Remote Sensing have been also development including
MACRES and MC GDI.

N2  - The World Health Organization identifies the overall increasing of noncommunicable diseases as a major issue, such as premature heart diseases, diabetes, and cancer. Unhealthy diets have been identified as the important causing factor of such diseases. In this context, personalized nutrition emerges as a new research field for providing tailored food intake advices to individuals according to their physical, physiological data, and further personal information. Specifically, in the last few years, several types of research have proposed computational models for personalized food recommendation using nutritional knowledge and user data. This paper presents a general framework for daily meal plan recommendations, incorporating as main feature the simultaneous management of nutritional-aware and preference-aware information, in contrast to the previous works which lack this global viewpoint. The proposal incorporates a pre-filtering stage that uses AHPSort as multi-criteria decision analysis tool for filtering out foods which are not appropriate to the current user characteristics. Furthermore, it incorporates an optimization-based stage for generating a daily meal plan whose goal is the recommendation of food highly preferred by the user, not consumed recently, and satisfying his/her daily nutritional requirements. A case study is developed for testing the performance of the recommender system.

N2  - There are a good number of different algorithms to solve multi- and many-objective optimization problems and the final outcome of these algorithms is a set of trade-off solutions that are expected to span the entire Pareto-front. Visualization of a Pareto-front is vital for an initial decision-making task, as it provides a number of useful information, such as closeness of one solution to another, trade-off among conflicting objectives, localized shape of the Pareto-front vis-a-vis the entire front, and others. Two and three-dimensional Pareto-fronts are trivial to visualize and allow all the above analysis to be done comprehensively. However, for four or more objectives, visualization for extracting above decision-making information gets challenging and new and innovative methods are long overdue. Not only does a trivial visualization becomes difficult, the number of points needed to represent a higher-dimensional front increase exponentially. The existing high-dimensional visualization techniques, such as parallel coordinate plots, scatter plots, RadVis, etc., do not offer a clear and natural view of the Pareto-front in terms of trade-off and other vital localized information needed for a convenient decision-making task. In this paper, we propose a novel way to map a high-dimensional Pareto-front in two and three dimensions. The proposed method tries to capture some of the basic topological properties of the Pareto points and retain them in the mapped lower dimensional space. Therefore, the proposed method can produce faithful representation of the topological primitives of the high-dimensional data points in terms of the basic shape (and structure) of the Pareto-front, its boundary, and visual classification of the relative trade-offs of the solutions. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we apply our proposed palette visualization method to a few problems.

N2  - To represent a many-objective Pareto-optimal front having four or more dimensions of the objective space, a large number of points are necessary. However, for choosing a single preferred point from a large set is problematic and time-consuming, as they provide a large cognitive burden on the part of the decision-makers (DMs). Hence, many-objective optimization and decision-making researchers and practitioners have been interested in effective visualization methods to filter down a few critical points for further analysis. While some ideas are borrowed from data analytics and visualization literature, they are generic and do not exploit the functionalities that DMs are usually interested. In this paper, we outline some such functionalities: a point's trade-off among conflicting objectives in its neighborhood, closeness of a point to the boundary or core of the high-dimensional Pareto set, specific desired geometric properties of points, spatial distance of one point to another, closeness of a point to constraint boundary, and others, in developing a new visualization technique. We propose a novel way to map a high-dimensional Pareto-optimal front (points or data-set) into two-and-half dimensions by revealing functional features of points that may be of great interest to DMs. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we apply our proposed palette visualization (PaletteViz) technique to a number of different structures of Pareto-optimal data-sets and discuss how the proposed technique is different from a few popularly used visualization techniques.

N2  - The world is dynamic and requires complex decisions to be made in-order to resolve the global challenges. One of the tools, which can be used to assist the analyst and expert decision makers, is the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). The dramatic increase in computer power, both wired and wireless connectivity, and availability of big data has affected the way we make decisions. This paper explores how big data and other technological information may be used to influence the MCDM process. A multi-case study, based on complex decisions made, was used to identify the key indicators to access the level of improvements in accuracy and speed as a result of big data in MCDM process. The paper also examines the barriers to the successful adoption of big data in decision making and suggests reasons why decision makers should be encouraged to adopt the digital technologies in global decision processes. Recommendations were then made on how to best adopt the e-technology and cyber-infrastructure to the MCDM process. The paper concluded by indicating further areas of research and recommends that the users of big data should increase vigilance at all times.

N2  - Benefiting from the real-time processing ability of edge computing, computing tasks requested by smart devices in the Internet of Things are offloaded to edge computing devices (ECDs) for implementation. However, ECDs are often overloaded or underloaded with disproportionate resource requests. In addition, during the process of task offloading, the transmitted information is vulnerable, which can result in data incompleteness. In view of this challenge, a blockchain-enabled computation offloading method, named BeCome, is proposed in this article. Blockchain technology is employed in edge computing to ensure data integrity. Then, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III is adopted to generate strategies for balanced resource allocation. Furthermore, simple additive weighting and multicriteria decision making are utilized to identify the optimal offloading strategy. Finally, performance evaluations of BeCome are given through simulation experiments.

Finally, it describes the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) and sensitivity analysis methods used for supporting the objective selection processes of the most suitable wireless technologies for different sets of requirements. The work presented here as a part of the research work accomplished in DLR has determined that fundamental parameters for the design of real-tune, deterministic data communication systems, like jitter among others must be defined before their technology foundation can be accurately selected. It has also identified some of the technology gaps which limit the implementation of wireless technologies for supporting airborne applications. © 2011 IEEE.

N2  - Today technology that learns from data to forecast future behavior of individuals, organizations, government and country as a whole, is playing a crucial role in the advancement of human race. In fact, the strategic advantage most of the companies today strive for are use of new available technologies like cloud computing and big data. However, today's dynamic business environment poses severe challenges in front of companies as to how to make use of the power of big data with the technical flexibility that cloud computing provides? Therefore, evaluating, ranking and selecting the most appropriate cloud solution to manage big data project is a complex concern which requires multi criteria decision environment. In this paper we propose a hybrid entropy method combined with Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) to select appropriate cloud solution to manage big data projects in group decision making environment. In order to collate individual opinions of decision makers for rating the importance of various criteria and alternatives, we employed usability analysis using the proposed hybrid AHP-Entropy method.

N2  - This paper presents an approach to solving the data variety problem of big data through an offline and online decisionmaking system. We present a graph-based approach to imitate real-world problem domain with a set of criteria and problem solvers. We introduce a Multi-criteria decision-making model to select a set of problem solvers that meets the set of criteria most. Suppose a system is processing Twitter data that comes as a stream of JSON records from multiple data sources. The decision system determines which of the available methods to use for a list of requirements (criteria). When multiple criteria (must meet requirements) coexist in a problem domain, their order of importance against the criteria, the mutual influence on each other and level of indispensability forms a graphic structure. In the proposed model, we consider each vertex of the graph as a criterion or benefit of an agent against the criterion. The mutual influence of multiple agents is denoted by the connecting edges of the graph. We also proposed a fuzzy graph framework to model real-world unpredictability. The model produces benchmarking results for each of the problem solvers in terms of absolute values to support decision making. The model is implemented through TopBread, Resource Description Framework (RDF), and RDF Data Query Language (RDQL). The key advantage of the proposed model over the existing ones is that the framework can operate in a dual-mode - both as a standalone offline tool and as an online decision-making gateway, it can also be used in high-velocity ingestion scenarios.

N2  - Today's software complexity makes developing defect-free software almost impossible. Consequently, developing classifiers to classify software modules into defective and non-defective before software releases have attracted great interest in academia and software industry alike. Although many classifiers have been proposed, no one has been proven superior over others. The major reason is that while a research shows that classifier A is better than classifier B, we can find other research that shows the opposite. These conflicts are usually triggered when researchers report results using their preferable performance evaluation measures such as, recall and precision. Although this approach is valid, it does not examine all possible facets of classifiers performance characteristics. Thus, the performance evaluation might improve or deteriorate if researchers choose other performance measures. As a result, software developers usually struggle to select the most suitable classifier to use in their projects. The goal of this paper is to apply the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) as a popular multicriteria decision-making technique to reliably evaluate classifiers' performance. This evaluation framework incorporates a wider spectrum of performance measures to evaluate classifiers performance rather than relying on selected preferable measures. The results show that this approach will increase software developers' confidence in research outcomes and help them in avoiding false conclusions and infer reasonable boundaries for them. We exploited 22 popular performance measures and 11 software defect classifiers. The analysis was carried out using KNIME data mining platform and 12 software defect data sets provided by the NASA metrics data program (MDP) repository.

N2  - Pipelines are the most important way to transport large amounts of dangerous substances as oil and gas, through long distances, due to their advantages in terms of safety and low cost. However, failures and leaks in pipelines may happen and sometimes they generate catastrophic consequences. In this paper we propose an approach for the risk assessment of oil and gas pipeline defects leveraging machines learning algorithms and multi-criteria decision methods (MCDM), with the objective of accompanying decision-makers for prioritizing risk mitigation activities. The pipeline defects risk assessment approach proposed is based on some machines learning algorithms, which allows to cluster ILI (In Line Inspection) data performed by smart pigs in a group of clusters by using K-means method, then, two classifications methods (decision trees and neural network) are applied on clusters in order to construct a classification model of defects risk on pipe in three level (High, Medium and Low) according to theirs criticizes. The discovered models are assessed using cross validation, which allows choosing a model based on a decision tree as a pipeline defects risk classification and prediction model. For scheduling maintenance and reparation operations we apply the multi-criteria decision method AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) in order to rank-order defects which belong to the High class according to theirs criticizes degree.

N2  - Although Batu City is more famous as a tourism city, agriculture still plays an important role in the economy of Batu City. The most dominant agricultural in the Batu City is the horticultural plants. In addition to horticultural plants, Batu City is also a producer of rice plant. But there are not many areas planted with rice plant in Batu City. In 2013, it was recorded by BPS that the area of paddy field cultivation in Batu City is 8,275,637 m2, in Batu sub-district is 1,226,352 m2, in Junrejo sub-district is 5,922,992 m2, and in Bumiaji sub-district is 1,126,293 m2. According to the results of the interviews from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Batu City, within one year, the land of rice plant is only planted with rice once or twice that should be done 3 times a year. It is because the farmers do not know the land is actually appropriate or not for rice plant. Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Batu City currently does not yet have data that related to the land is actually appropriate or not for planting rice. The data is required, so it can be used as a reference in managing agricultural land. To get the results of the land suitability, this study will apply the methods of GIS-MCDA (Multi Criteria Decision Analysis), which used 9 criterias (elevation, slope, rainfall, light intensity, temperature, air moisture, type of soil, soil pH, and river) that affect the suitability of the land and the result will be applied in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based on the web. GIS based on the web (Web-GIS) is built according to the architectural design. Web-GIS architecture consists of 3 layers, i.e. the Client Layer, Service Layer, and Layer Support. With the creation of this Web-GIS, is expected to land suitability analysis result can be visualized better and can provide the information properly and clearly for users. Based on the result of land suitability analysis, this research get four results of land suitability class i.e., S1, S2, S3, and NS. Total area of suitability class of S1 is 739.42 ha with percentage 3.7%, total area of suitability class of S2 is 7375.91 ha with percentage 37%, total area of suitability class of S3 is 3706.20 ha with percentage 18.6%, and total area of suitability class of NS is 8120.02 ha with percentage 40.7%.

N2  - Procurement in facilities management is a complex process for linking different stakeholders together to form an integrated service, it is a crucial process for identifying the best sources of supplier and best suited contractor in improving the efficiency of resources allocation, maintaining equipment reliability and availability to enhance facilities conditions in order to reduce business risks, attract tenants, increase asset and building value. Hence, a building's Return of Investment (ROI) and payback can be incredibly beneficial by enabling the procurement decision to meet its strategic objectives in an economic, efficient and effective manner. However, in current process, procurement is financially consuming and expensive as it requires high demand of manpower and involves enormous amount of paper work for managing requests, quotations, bid requirements and evaluations. Also, there is lack of quantitative measures by incorporating linguistic selection criteria from domain experts in the procurement selection process for improving competitive advantage. Even though applications of digitalization for conveying information to digital format in streamlining internal process have been considered, competiveness and capabilities assessment of current supply base, quantitative and qualitative data analysis on contractor selection and relevant performance feedback is lacking to support the decision-marking. Therefore, in this paper, a cloud-based Fuzzy multi-criteria decision support system (CFMDS) is proposed for integrating with procurement process for performing award analytics to identify the best suited supplier and contractor. The procurement officer can then formulate a follow up plan based on the recommended results.

N2  - There are a number of decision making problems in which Geographical Information System (GIS) had been applied to facilitate the procedure of analyzing the problem and to capture, store, query, analyze, display and output geographic information. The integration between Geographic information systems (GIS) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), had significantly developed over the last 25 years. GIS plays an essential role in decision problem analysis. At the same time, Multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) also provide a varity of procedures to structure the decision problems, along with this the alternative decisions will be designed and evaluated. Indeed, most of the fundamental level GIS-MCDA is processed as the transformation and combination of geographical data and criteria judgement, in order to achieve successful decision making. However, the variety and complexity of MCDA methods means that this valuable set of tools is not easily accessible. This paper presents various MCDA methods which exists in literature. In this work, an analysis of MCDA methods was conducted. The objective is to define the most appropriate MCDA methods in terms of: results consistency, ease of facilities and decision adaptation.

N2  - As being one of the most popular applications in the last decade, dynamic adaptive video streaming applications are used by Internet users every day. In such applications, the underlying architecture allows users to change quality adaptively as their request. The purpose of quality or rate adaptation algorithm is to achieve highest QoE possible. In this paper, we propose a rate adaptation algorithm which allows to increase the quality of already buffered video by using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method. Increasing the quality of the buffered video can be beneficial in areas from resiliency to entertainment. We propose to utilize SDN for deciding weights of MCDM method. For this purpose, SDN controller runs a machine learning algorithm by using its knowledge about current network conditions as an input of the learning algorithm. Simulation results show that users achieve higher QoE by using our approach when compared to conventional rate adaptation algorithm.

This paper tries to get the weight of ten criteria objectively using entropy and used those criteria weighting in comparative analysis for prediction of accuracy and precision of three multi-criteria decision-making methods, i.e., Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), Weighted Product (WP), and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The result showed that the fourth grade point average has the biggest impact on degree-completion time with 0.1589 of weight and weighted product is the best method to use with percentage of accuracy 61.3 percent and precision 52.85 percent. The result of this research can be used to help academic staff in making decision for student admission and administering mentoring process.

N2  - This paper evaluates the performance of a 10kV SiC MOSFET based direct Medium Voltage (MV) connected Extreme Fast Charger (XFC) for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging applications. Two-stage converter topology is considered, where the Active Front End (AFE) is directly connected to the 4.16kV MV grid. The MVDC output of the AFE is processed by the isolated DC-DC converter to achieve the output voltage that is compatible with the EV battery. Thanks to the reconfiguration capability, the proposed XFC can charge both 400V and 800V EVs without any significant performance degradation. The data collected through experimental characterization of the 10kV SiC MOSFETs is used for simulating the complete converter of MV-XFC and performing loss analysis through MV SiC modeling in PLECs software. Analytical transformer losses and multiobjective design optimization are obtained using MATLAB. Based on the outcome of the multiobjective design optimization, the converter design parameters are selected and the trade-off between the loss and volume of the proposed design has been evaluated.

Design factors including bump pad configuration, solder alloy composition, bump pad opening diameter, pad overhang (Cu pad radius minus pad opening radius), redistribution layer (RDL) polymer dielectric thickness and under-bump Cu thickness are grouped and considered by using a 3-level full factorial design of simulations (DoS) procedure. Key failure indices corresponding to solder joint fatigue fracture, RDL trace fatigue fracture and polymer dielectric cracking are selected as the objective functions for the design optimization. The Pareto optimal solutions are determined by using a genetic algorithm, and the compromise programming method is applied to determine the most reliable design. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - E-waste management involves the selection of e-waste location of dismantling and sorting facility (DSF). Unfortunately, Indonesia, at present, has no disposal sites. Site selection decision complexity involves a lot of criteria to filter the various alternative locations. As the initial step, the aims of this study is to select the optimal location of DSF in Indonesia using multi-criteria decision analysis. In this case, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model was applied. Eight criteria were selected to choose the optimal location, e.g. local population (C1), population served (C2), percentage of monthly non-food expenditure (C3), distance from existing e-waste dismantling and sorting facility (C4), average house per unit (C5), unemployed population (C6), financial status of local population (C7), and distance from the nearest port (C8). Data of eight criteria then were ranked based on the objective function of each criterion, which were maximizing function (C1, C2, C3, C4, C6) and minimize function (C5, C7, C8). The results of those ranking then summed based on the weight resulted from AHP, and finally generated five main alternatives in selecting e-waste DSF. Based on this model, West Java was selected as the optimal location of e-waste DSF. West Java is one of the most populated provinces in Indonesia and located near the capital city of Indonesia.

N2  - Over the last few years, the number of smart objects connected to the Internet has grown exponentially in comparison to the number of services and applications. The integration between Cloud Computing and Internet of Things, named as Cloud of Things, plays a key role in managing the connected things, their data and services. One of the main challenges in Cloud of Things is the resource discovery of the smart objects and their reuse in different contexts. Most of the existent work uses some kind of multi-criteria decision analysis algorithm to perform the resource discovery, but do not evaluate the impact that the user constraints has in the final solution. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of the SAW, TOPSIS and VIKOR multi-objective decision analyses algorithms and the impact of user constraints on them. We evaluated the quality of the proposed solutions using the Pareto-optimality concept.

N2  - ABC analysis is an inventory management technique used to classify inventory items into three predefined and ordered categories A, B and C: Category A contains items with the highest impact for the company, while the category C contains items with the lowest impact. The aim of this classification technique is to keep related inventory costs under control. According to the ABC analysis, the classification of items into categories is based on their weighted scores. The score of each item is the result of an aggregation function that combines the item evaluations on the different criteria and the criteria weights. In ABC literature many classification models - issued from different fields such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Mathematical Programming (MP) and Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) - are proposed to infer the criteria weights. This paper proposes two classification models based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) to infer the criteria weights. The two classifications of items obtained by these models optimize respectively the two following objective functions: The Total Relevant Cost (TRC to be minimized) and the Inventory Turnover Ratio (ITR to be maximized). To estimate the performance of the proposed classification models, a benchmark data set of 47 items consumed in a Hospital Respiratory Therapy Unit (HRTU) is used.

N2  - The agencies responsible for transportation corridors tend to hold large volumes of data that can be relevant for both operations and planning. Meanwhile, it is a challenge for these agencies to prioritize their investments addressing risk, benefits, and costs. The agencies recognize an opportunity to improve project selection and programming with a centralized database of performance measures that will aid a consistent application of evaluation metrics. To support the identification, planning, and selection of highway transportation projects, this research has used a data structure known as dynamic segmentation for cross-referencing heterogeneous data sources including projects, traffic, safety, bridge and pavement conditions, etc. The result is a multiscale method for agencies to utilize big-data analytics and multicriteria decision analysis to assemble evidence for project selection and prioritization. The paper describes an approach to (1) visualize multiple attributes along linearized road corridors to identify future projects, minimize conflicts with current projects, and identify potential project synergies and (2) prioritize projects to the Top-20 with multiple performance factors. The methods are demonstrated at several geographic scales. The effort supports a fast, repeatable, and evidence-driven prioritization of projects and provides a complement to the use of electronic map data that has been overwhelming the available computing resources.

N2  - The integration between cloud computing and vehicular ad hoc networks, namely, vehicular clouds (VCs), has become a significant research area. This integration was proposed to accelerate the adoption of intelligent transportation systems. The trustworthiness in VCs is expected to carry more computing capabilities that manage large-scale collected data. This trend requires a security evaluation framework that ensures data privacy protection, integrity of information, and availability of resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that proposes a robust trustworthiness evaluation of vehicular cloud for security criteria evaluation and selection. This article proposes three-level security features in order to develop effectiveness and trustworthiness in VCs. To assess and evaluate these security features, our evaluation framework consists of three main interconnected components: 1) an aggregation of the security evaluation values of the security criteria for each level; 2) a fuzzy multicriteria decision-making algorithm; and 3) a simple additive weight associated with the importance-performance analysis and performance rate to visualize the framework findings. The evaluation results of the security criteria based on the average performance rate and global weight suggest that data residency, data privacy, and data ownership are the most pressing challenges in assessing data protection in a VC environment. Overall, this article paves the way for a secure VC using an evaluation of effective security features and underscores directions and challenges facing the VC community. This article sheds light on the importance of security by design, emphasizing multiple layers of security when implementing industrial VCs.

N2  - Diagnosis of deadly diseases, such as liver fibrosis, is very important. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) based on patient's historical medical data and accurate AI techniques can aid physicians in their decision-making process. The task of arriving at an accurate and timely diagnosis decision is always complex because of the dynamic, vagueness, and uncertainty associated with this disease. Fuzzy logic can perfectly handle these issues. In recent years, two of the most interesting techniques are a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The FAHP is popular for dealing with uncertainty in multi-criteria decision-making, and the ANFIS is popular in learning fuzzy inference system from data based on artificial neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, these two methods have not been used to model CDSSs in fibrosis stage detection domain. In this paper, we develop a CDSS based on a case comparison of the effectiveness of the FAHP and the ANFIS in the medical diagnosis of the fibrosis disease. We carefully design and implement two frameworks based on these two techniques. Diagnostic real data of 119 cases infected by chronic viral hepatitis C from the Liver Institute at Mansoura University in Egypt are used to train and test both the FAHP and ANFIS. Criteria and subcriteria weights are based on opinions of two domain experts. The ANFIS model is designed using trial and error based on the analysis of various experiments. Results are later compared with the diagnostic conclusions of medical expert and other three medical and fuzzy techniques. The comparison results show that these two techniques can successfully be employed in designing a diagnostic CDSS system for fibrosis diagnosis. The two techniques achieve a classification accuracy of 93.3%. The results confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of both methods. Therefore, both the FAHP and ANFIS are viable approaches in modeling CDSS for diagnosis of a liver fibrosis stage.

N2  - One of the main features of the Information security management system which should be performed according to the organization requirements is the information security risk management. Risk evaluation and risk ranking is a key procedure in this management activity. This research introduces a new method for ranking risks of information security by using two decision making models, TOPSIS model and AHP in fuzzy environment. Comparing test results of the new FAHP-TOPSIS model with the FAHP model shows that the average weights of new model has increased dramatically with smaller error ratio and provides more precise results.

N2  - Hydrological cycle is comprised of many constituents, the most important of which is precipitation. Simulation results greatly depend upon the quality of precipitation data as it is entered as the primary input for hydrological model simulations. Due to its chronological and spatial unpredictability, rainfall is considered as one of the most unreliable and irregular atmospheric parameters and therefore rain gauges serve as the main resource of measurement of rainfall. Rain-gauge network is the most commonly used source for rainfall measurement as it works by offering direct measurements of precipitation intensity and time duration at individual point sites. The collected information is further used by Meteorologists, hydrologists and weather reporters who subsequently report how much rain was received in a specific area in an individual event as well as in a particular span of time. over the years, researchers have been trying to overcome the difficulties faced in the installation of rain gauge networks. The main reason for the errors occurring in the aerial rainfall data for a region is inadequate gauge density. Due to rapidly increasing urbanization and climate change, critical attention is being paid not only to rainfall monitoring but also to the urban waterlogging. Siting selection methods that are used conventionally do not contemplate the environmental surroundings and spatial-temporal scale to choose a site for rain gauge networks. Therefore, the objective of this study was to observe and calculate the need of additional numbers of rain gauges in an area of interest. To execute the intended purpose, the technique of "Estimation of Optimum number of Rain Gauges proposed by Das and Saikia" is used, whereas the appropriate site selection for rain gauges in study area is determined using "Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)" using Geographic Information System (GIS). The variables which were incorporated for multi criteria assessment include; elevation, slope, rainfall data (2010), land use/cover, and exiting number of rain gauges in study area. A scale ranges from 1 to 3, "1" being the least suitable, "2" being mildly suitable and "3" being the highly suitable. A site suitability map of the study area is drawn by overlaying these layers in GIS. Results of the experiment exhibit that the suggested methods are appropriate for site selection for rain gauges in urban areas which will also play an important role in the selection of the sites for hydrological facilities, such as water gauge.

N2  - Evaluating the learners to determine their proficiency in programming is a challenging task. In this paper, we attempt to automate this task by analyzing dynamic data collected from programming platform through sensors. Since the performance of students in programming course and their assessment depend on multiple criteria, we model the problem of finding the proficiency of student as a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. We present a novel solution using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with which each student is classified into one of the expertise levels which represent their competency in a particular programming language. This competency based approach will help course instructors to grade the students. This grading helps the teachers to identify students who are facing difficulties in learning and to guide them to improve their technical skills. We validate our results by comparing them with marks scored by the students in the examination of that course.

N2  - Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) is one of the most widely used decision methodologies in the sciences, business, government and engineering fields. The goal of this research is to extend multi-criteria decision-making method to multi-class classification problem. Multi-criteria decision classifier (MCDC) is a new classifier and is proposed by this research for dealing with multi class classification problem. The application of MCDC is that it can consider as a weak classifier for adaboost classifier although the accurate rate of MCDC is worst than back-propagation neural network (BPNN). This study will make an example to implement and compare the proposed method with BPNN, KNN and Bayesian classifier. Finally, we will make a conclusion and future research. © 2011 IEEE.

N2  - This paper proposes a comprehensive approach for the multi-objective design optimization of switched reluctance machines (SRMs). An analytical model that predicts the electromagnetic (EM) behaviors of SRMs with arbitrary geometries, materials or current profiles is first developed and validated by its finite-element analysis (FEA) counterpart in terms of various performance indices. Then, a hybrid thermal model combining a 2-dimensional (2D) finite-difference (FD) formulation and thermal equivalent circuits is used to estimate the temperature distribution within an SRM based on the loss distribution calculated by the analytical EM model. The multi-physics model can evaluate the performances of an SRM much faster than the prevalent finite-element analysis (FEA). In addition, to further reduce the computational cost, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are constructed based on the maximin Latin hypercube design (MLHD) to identify the relationship between the SRM performance indices and the selected design variables within the entire predefined design space. Then, incorporating the pre-trained ANN models, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based multi-objective optimization approach is utilized to identify the Pareto optimal design candidates in terms of maximizing the efficiency and torque density, and minimizing the torque ripple. The thermal constraints as well as the effects of current profiles are incorporated in the design process. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively generate the Pareto front within about half an hour with the evaluation of over 60,000 design candidates.

N2  - Determining the arithmetic operations of fuzzy numbers is a very important issue in fuzzy sets theory, decision process, data analysis, and applications. In 1985, Chen formulated the arithmetic operations between generalized fuzzy numbers by proposing the function principle. Since then, researchers have shown an increased interest in generalized fuzzy numbers. Most of existing studies done using generalized fuzzy numbers were based on Chen's (1985) arithmetic operations. Despite its merits, there were some shortcomings associated with Chen's method. In order to overcome the drawbacks of Chen's method, this paper develops the extension principle to derive arithmetic operations between generalized trapezoidal (triangular) fuzzy numbers. Several examples demonstrating the usage and advantages of the proposed method are presented. It can be concluded that the proposed method can effectively resolve the issues with Chen's method. Finally, the proposed extension principle is applied to solve a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Digitalisation in the form of new technologies and solutions is a rapid movement affecting the whole world. Home or assistive care has had a long period of trouble trying keep up, even though it is a promising area of application. As home care tries to catch up, rushing to implement technologies or IT systems can result in misfit solutions that do not satisfy their purpose. The values of healthcare mean that measuring success of technology implementation is different than in production sectors. The main focus is patient satisfaction and should, therefore, also be included in any evaluation. The present study proposes a conceptual model that aims to facilitate considering both quantitative and qualitative data, including patient and caregiver values, when measuring efficiency in healthcare management. The model combines multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) to make it possible to handle both crisp and fuzzy values. The model is tested and evaluated using a home care case study, which shows promising results.

N2  - Continued economic growth of any country requires a sustainable energy supply. Pakistan's energy sector is suffering from a serious energy crisis from the past two decades and mainly depends on conventional energy sources, which are costly and unsustainable. Moreover, electricity production across the country is largely dependent on oil and gas products while the utility of renewable energy resources is dismal. To evaluate a country's energy system is a complex analysis that can be defined as a multi-dimensional problem of different alternatives and its criteria. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) of the Multi-Criteria Decision Making Analysis tool provides a reliable methodology to rank different energy alternatives on the basis of selected criteria. In this paper, renewable and conventional energy power plants are analyzed on the basis of actual data of technical, economic and environmental criteria. The AHP results of this study show that the most favorable and sustainable energy plants for electricity production in terms of the above criteria and sub-criteria are renewable power plants followed by conventional power plants.

The most important attack which affects the availability of service is Distributed Denial of Service. The service disruption may cause substantial financial loss as well as damage to the concerned network system. The traffic patterns exhibited by the DDoS affected traffic can be effectively captured by machine learning algorithms. This paper gives an evaluation and ranking of some of the supervised machine learning algorithms with the aim of reducing type I and type II errors, increasing precision and recall while maintaining detection accuracy. The performance evaluation is done using Multi Criteria Decision Aid software called Visual PROMETHEE. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble based classifiers especially the ensemble algorithm of Adaboost with Random Forest as the base classifier. Publicly available datasets such as DARPA scenario specific dataset, CAIDA DDoS Attack 2007 and CAIDA Conficker are used to evaluate the algorithms.

N2  - Skyline queries have wide-ranging applications in fields that involve multi-criteria decision making, including tourism, retail industry, and human resources. By automatically removing incompetent candidates, skyline queries allow users to focus on a subset of superior data items (i.e., the skyline), thus reducing the decision-making overhead. However, users are still required to interpret and compare these superior items manually before making a successful choice. This task is challenging because of two issues. First, people usually have fuzzy, unstable, and inconsistent preferences when presented with multiple candidates. Second, skyline queries do not reveal the reasons for the superiority of certain skyline points in a multi-dimensional space. To address these issues, we propose SkyLens, a visual analytic system aiming at revealing the superiority of skyline points from different perspectives and at different scales to aid users in their decision making. Two scenarios demonstrate the usefulness of SkyLens on two datasets with a dozen of attributes. A qualitative study is also conducted to show that users can efficiently accomplish skyline understanding and comparison tasks with SkyLens.

N2  - Since Chinese reform and opening up, the total economy has kept a rapid development trend, which also makes Chinese environmental pollution problems become increasingly serious. In recent years, Chinese government has introduced a large number of environmental protection policies to alleviate the contradiction between economic development and environmental pollution. However, the economic level, resource endowment and government system of China vary from one region to another, which leads to the result that the implementation of environmental protection policies is not satisfactory. In order to achieve economic sustainable development better, each region of China needs to be tailored to develop respective environmental protection institution according to its own regional characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and evaluate the operational effect of Chinese existing regional environmental protection institution and put forward the corresponding improvement measures. In order to evaluate the operational effect of Chinese environmental protection institution system (EPIS), the following works have been carried out: Firstly, the constitution and operational mechanism of EPIS are analyzed. The Chinese EPIS consists of the environmental laws and regulations subsystem, the environmental protection administrative institution subsystem, the environmental economic policy subsystem and the public participation institution subsystem, and the four subsystems are interdependent and interact with each other. Then, the comprehensive evaluation index system of EPIS is constructed with systemic completeness, systemic execution, ecological environment and economic development as the four criteria layers. There are total 15 indexes under four criteria layers. At last, the evaluation of the regional EPIS based on the hybrid extended TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multi criteria decision making) method is proposed with considering the hybrid evaluation information including real numbers and grey numbers. In addition, the novel ranking method and orthocenter distance of grey number based on whitening weight function are proposed to established hybrid TODIM methods. The empirical analysis is presented according to the data of Chinese 30 provinces in the year of 2014–2015. According to the hybrid TODIM method proposed in this paper, we get the evaluation results including completeness and operational effects of regional EPIS. In order to present the regional difference distinctly, k-means method is used to get the clustering results of regional EPIS. The clustering results demonstrate that: (1) The EPIS with excellent operational effect is mainly concentrated in the eastern coastal areas. This is mainly because these regions are relatively developed in the natural, economic, social, human and ecological environment. (2)Regions where the EPIS works moderately are concentrated in the central region. This is because the central region is close to the eastern region in geographical location, and affected by the diffusion effect of eastern region. (3)Regions where the EPIS works badly are concentrated in the western region. This is because the operation of the environmental protection system lacks a certain degree of impetus under the influence of relatively high environmental quality. According to the research on operational effect of EPIS based on hybrid TODIM method, some conclusions could be obtained: (1)The completeness and operational effect of Chinese EPIS are decreasing from east to west, showing a significant decrease in regional gradient. (2) The new ranking method of interval grey number is considering the value distribution information of grey numbers, and the new distance function is effective to measure two interval grey numbers.(3) The hybrid TODIM method proposed in this paper is valid to evaluate the operational effect of Chinese regional EPIS.

It uses tourist ecological footprint model (TEFM) to optimize the non-linear characteristic indexes that affect the demand for sports tourism destinations, and then obtain the initial data for predicting the demand for sports tourism destinations. Then it adopts the multi-objective decision-making theory to conduct trade mediation for the long-term conflict of sports tourism destinations. Finally, through TEFM it makes compensation for sports tourism destinations for long-term conflicts. The analysis of experimental results shows that compared with other different models, the model designed in this paper has high prediction accuracy and can accurately predict the demand trend for sports tourism destinations.

N2  - As a significant technology in the automotive manufacturing industry, weight reduction in vehicle design has attracted much attention. Its effect on energy saving and emission reduction is prominent. The application of lightweight material is commonly adopted as a primary way of weight reduction. However, material selection is often subject to multi-perspective performance characteristics, e.g., mechanical and societal properties, and therefore, an effective multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method is needed. This paper presents a systematic hierarchical structure of multi-perspective indices for optimal lightweight material selection, including mechanical, durability, societal, and technical properties. A hybrid evaluation approach (G-TOPSIS) integrating grey relation analysis and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is applied to evaluate lightweight material alternatives and obtain an optimal one. A case study, i.e., 17 kinds of lightweight materials, is conducted to verify the hierarchical structure and the MCDM method. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to monitor the robustness of solution ranking to changes. The results show that this method provides an effective decision-making tool for optimal lightweight material selection for automobile applications.

N2  - The paper discusses low-cost multi-objective optimization of compact microwave components using variablefidelity EM simulation models and data-driven surrogates. Our approach builds upon a recently reported method where the initial approximation of the Pareto set is obtained by optimizing the kriging surrogate constructed from sampled data of the coarsediscretization EM model of the structure at hand, with selected designs further refined to obtain the high-fidelity Pareto set. The drawback of the method is a large number of training data samples required to set up the surrogate. Here, considerable savings concerning the training data set size are achieved by Pareto front decomposition based on auxiliary points identified along the front and setting up the kriging models in the corresponding subdomains. The key factor is that the total volume of the sub-domains is considerably smaller than the volume of the original domain. Our considerations are illustrated using a compact rat-race coupler with design optimization cost savings of 29-and 30-percent for two and three sub-domains, respectively.

N2  - Goal Programming (GP) is a relevant and simple technique in Operations Research that helps Decision Makers in solving problems involving conflicting and competing criteria and objectives. A GP program is a distance-based model that involves the minimization of the difference between the achievement level of a certain criterion and its goal. GP models when combined with the notion of satisfaction or utility function provide practical advantage to the decision maker to include a system of preferences. In this paper, we present a GP model with satisfaction function that concurrently incorporates criteria on number of employees across various economic sectors and multiple sustainability goals on GDP growth, electricity consumption and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The presented model offers critical inputs in planning and implementation of amenable strategies towards sustainable development. We validate the proposed model with data on vital economic sectors of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) towards achieving year 2030 goals.

N2  - The long-term prospect of the company's progress is determined by the quality of human resources (HR), The urgency to maintain the company's survival it takes a reliable and futuristic leader. Measuring tool that can be used is none other than the performance of human resources. Of course with potential leaders will provide the vision of the company's mission to grow and expand. Leadership selection process can be done with promotion positions based on performance preference. The purpose of this research is to conduct selection of performance promotion based on performance using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) selection methods such as Analytic Hiererachy Process (AHP), VIKOR, ELECTRE, and Promethee, in addition to proving the result of a number of methods based on MCDM such as AHP for the determination of preferences data design, while for data analysis using three methods that will be compared the results of VIKOR, ELECTREE and Promethee. The measurable performance bases for promotional positions are viewed from seven criteria described in the modeling hierarchy using the concept of analytic hierararchy process in the discussion of this paper. The results obtained provide an interpretation that the promethee method is closer to the actual results, while the vikor method is almost close to the results of truth and far away when compared with the electre method. Thus, it can be concluded that the best method for placing employee positions is promethee method.

N2  - This paper discusses the application of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, more specifically Correlation Feature Selection (CFS), in multi-objective design optimization of problems where the computational cost (of optimization) is dominated by the cost of solution evaluations, e.g. electromagnetic shape design problems. Here, CFS is used in order to reduce the dimensionality of the design space. As demonstrated through an Internal Permanent Magnet (IPM) motor design problem, the reduction information can be useful in decreasing the cost of optimization as well as detecting the dependencies of different variables in the vicinity of the optima.

N2  - Traditionally, the data generated in the manufacturing process is not under full use for management decisions, so it is difficult to achieve the decision optimization in a manufacturing system level. The analysis of the big data with uncertain information that influences the assembly objectives can be helpful to improve the capacity of resisting the disturbance of the scheduling system and realize the optimal production. This paper focuses on the analysis and utilization of assembly big data in the manufacturing process and studies the key technologies of big data analysis and assembly scheduling optimization for complex equipment. A big data analysis and scheduling optimization system is proposed to solve the assembly service execution decision for complex equipment. It proposes to analyze the assembly big data and make decisions with uncertain information by locally linear embedding, adaptive boosting, support vector machine, and D-S evidence theory. In order to explore the influence pattern of assembly task and environment on assembly efficiency, the neural industrial engineering is proposed to be introduced into human error prediction based on physiological big data. Finally, the variable metric clustering of assembly tasks can be provided to ensure the maximization of assembly efficiency and the production balance. The proposed system can effectively handle the dynamic and uncertain information in the assembly, and get better overall scheduling optimization of the assembly system. The support technologies presented in this paper can provide a good theoretical foundation and application reference for big data decision to be used in manufacturing optimization.

N2  - Post-crisis response and recovery necessitates the identification and prioritization of the needs and capacities of the affected community in order to provide efficient and wellcoordinated humanitarian assistance. The Community Based Comprehensive Recovery platform aims to facilitate enhanced communication flows between professional communities, affected communities, and volunteer responders to enhance situational awareness, inform and guide response planning, and ensure more effective coordination of activities by volunteer responders. Underpinning the platform, an information framework has been designed to support acquisition and analysis of the needs and capacities that arise across affected communities. In addition, a multi-criteria decision making algorithm has been designed and developed in order to enhance sense making and situational awareness within the platform. Subsequently, this paper introduces the core concepts that provide a basis for the information model, along with the associated ontology. Furthermore, the paper presents details of the decision making algorithm in conjunction with results from its application to a representative set of sample data.

N2  - Data visualization is an essential step in data science to get better interpretation to analyse data. The parallel coordinates plot (PCP) is a well-known method to visualize high-dimensional $(D \gt 3)$ data without dimension reduction. In large-scale datasest, PCP may fail because of many clutters and crossing lines in the plot. The order of coordinates is one of the parameters in PCP which can affect on the performance of this method. Finding the best order can be considered as a multi-criteria comparison task based on different metrics such as minimizing the number of crossing lines between adjacent coordinates and the maximizing the pairwise correlation coefcient values. In order to improve the visualization of data using PCP, this paper presents a multi-metric Pareto-VIKOR ranking (PVRPCP), a new method which determines the best order of coordinates based on optimizing two or more metrics. The method consists of evaluating all possible coordinates permutations based on evaluation metrics and applying non-dominated sorting algorithm (NDS) to obtain the Pareto-front ranks (PF). The solutions on each Pareto front are then ranked by VIKOR, a multi-criteria decision making measure. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the the proposed method in data visualization, we also designed several multi-dimensional benchmarks to represent the effect of ordering in PCP. In addition to author-created benchmarks, several multi-objective function benchmarks and real-world datasets are utilized to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that the PVRPCP offers improved PCP visualization compared to the original order in terms of both utilized metrics.

N2  - Decision-making processes in complex systems generally require the mechanisms to make the tradeoff among contradicting design criteria. When multiple objectives are involved in decision making or machine learning, a crucial step is to determine the weights of individual objectives to the system-level performance. Determining the weights of multiobjectives is an evaluation process, and it has been often treated as an optimization problem. However, our preliminary investigation has shown that existing methodologies in dealing with the weights of multiobjectives have some obvious limitations in the sense that the determination of weights is tackled as a single optimization problem, a result based on such an optimization is incomprehensive, and it can even be unreliable when the information about multiple objectives is incomplete such as an incompleteness caused by poor data. The constraints of weights are also discussed. Variable weights are natural in decision-making processes. Therefore, we are motivated to develop a systematic methodology in determining variable weights of multiobjectives. The roles of weights in an original multiobjective decision-making or machine-learning problem are analyzed, and the weights are determined with the aid of a modular neural network. The inconsistency issue of weights is particularly discussed. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Unsupervised or clustering algorithms can be considered to overcome the need for both high-quantity and high-quality training data for hyperspectral data classification. One of the most widely used algorithms for the clustering of remotely-sensed data is partitional clustering. Partitional clustering is affected by 1) the optimal number of clusters (NOC), 2) the position of cluster centers in hyper-dimension space, and 3) a set of optimally discriminating spectral bands. Among these three parameters, the NOC and their positions can be found simultaneously by dynamic clustering approaches. In this paper, an innovative two-stage dynamic clustering method is proposed and evaluated. In the first stage, the optimum set of solutions is achieved by a multi-objective particle swarm optimization. Then, using an efficient multi-criteria decision-making method, namely, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), a ranking is done among the optimal set of solutions to select the best one. Comparisons with some classic algorithms reveal that the proposed method is more effective at detecting the optimal number and position of clusters. In addition, the proposed algorithm generates better clustering results for hyperspectral data. Indeed, our method leads to a 5%-10% improvement upon classification accuracy. © 2014 IEEE.

N2  - The selection of Ultra-High Voltage (UHV) substation site is a complex multi-objective decision-making problem. The randomness of wind power output and continuous adjustment of the grid structure will bring uncertain factors to the decision-making process, which will directly affect the stability of decision-making result. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis is necessary to be carried out to the uncertainty of index values and index weights in the decision-making process. Firstly, this paper carries out the sensitivity analysis under the change of single index and multiple weights respectively. Three comprehensive evaluation methods including Delphi, Entropy weight method, grey relational analysis (GRA), which will help decision makers master and deal with the sensitive indexes and weights more carefully in the decision-making process. Secondly, this paper takes comprehensive evaluation values of each alternative obtained by each comprehensive evaluation method with the change of index values and index weights as sample data respectively, and introduces cloud model to compare the robustness of decision-making results under each comprehensive evaluation method in order to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each comprehensive evaluation method, this will help decision makers choose the comprehensive evaluation method with better robustness of decision result. Finally the example analysis results verify the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper, so as to gain insight into the sensitivity analysis of decision problem and relate it back to real engineering application.

N2  - The Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem is an interesting and dynamic area for research. Many researchers have contributed different methods for effective ranking of the alternatives. All these methods work with the background of crisp or fuzzy data. Recent research has widely used fuzzy data for representation and the popular among them is the Triangular Fuzzy Number (TFN). In this paper, we make efforts to solve the problem of selection of head nurse for health care using hybridized VIKOR method under TFN environment. The weights of the criteria are determined using Analytical Hierarchal Process (AHP) method. We now integrate AHP with VIKOR to form a hybrid framework for selecting a suitable head nurse for the health care. The strength of the framework is verified by comparing the proposed framework with other methods. Correlation inference shows that the proposed framework is consistent with the other state of the art schemes. We also infer that the proposed hybrid framework is a better choice for MCDM problems involving uncertainties and ambiguities.

The solving procedure is as follows, (i) the weights of criteria are determined by the group decision making models based on AHP; (ii) using the weighted grey relational degree between the reference data sequence and optimal data sequence to result the ranking order for all alternatives; (iii) An illustrative example is provided to verify the proposed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

A real-time and effective credit card holders' churn analysis is important and helpful for bankers to maintain credit card holders. In this research we apply 12 classification algorithms in a real-life credit card holders' behaviors dataset from a major commercial bank in China to construct a predictive churn model. Furthermore, a comparison is made between the predictive performance of classification algorithms based on Multi-Criteria Decision Making techniques such as PROMETHEE II and TOPSIS.

N2  - Waste tire related environmental problems and its recycling techniques have been a major issue nowadays because of their complex combination of very different materials, which include several rubbers, carbon blacks, steel cord and other organic and inorganic minor components. Most important problem in the scrap tire recycling program is type of product recovery options because there are few specific data available. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was used to assess options in reverse logistics for waste tire. MCDA is a widely used decision methodology that considers conflicting systems of criteria. However, many real-world decision problems involve ambiguity and imprecise information. In this study, the analysis has been undertaken using an extended version of MACBETH methodology to take into account the imprecise and linguistic assessments provided by a decision-maker by integrating the 2-tuple model dealing with non-homogeneous information data. The proposed fuzzy MACBETH method has been applied to a real case related to the automobile tire waste to elucidate its details. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - The prioritization of available alternatives is at the core of the multi-criteria decision making. It is typically done by assigning a priority weight to each of the alternatives. The weights indicate the alternatives' relative importance with respect to a given criterion. Many of prioritization methods are based on pairwise comparisons of the decision alternatives. As a result of such comparisons, a pairwise comparison matrix (PCM) that contains priority-weights-ratios is received. In this type of decision-making analysis a special attention is paid to so-called inconsistency analysis. It is a popular claim, that big errors in judgments about the priority ratios make the data contained in PCM useless. To 'measure' the degree of PCM inconsistency various indices are proposed in literature. But the usage of these indices is justified only by some heuristics. In this paper we use simulation-based approach to the analysis of the relationships between the inconsistency indices and the errors of priority-vector's estimates. These relationships are examined under different simulation frameworks that reflect different requirements forced by the PCM-creation methodology. The simulation studies enable us to gain a deeper insight into the nature of pairwise comparisons methodology as well as new knowledge about the impact of various conventional assumptions, taken within the pairwise comparison approach, on the quality of the final priority-weights-estimates.

N2  - Finding and classifying all efficient solutions for a Bi-Objective Integer Linear Programming (BOILP) problem is one of the controversial issues in Multi-Criteria Decision Making problems. The main aim of this study is to utilize the well-known Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology to tackle this issue. Toward this end, we first state some propositions to clarify the relationships between the efficient solutions of a BOILP and efficient Decision Making Units (DMUs) in DEA and next design a new two-stage approach to find and classify a set of efficient solutions. Stage I formulates a two-phase Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, based on the Free Disposal Hull (FDH) model in DEA, to gain a Minimal Complete Set of efficient solutions. Stage II uses a variable returns to scale DEA model to classify the obtained efficient solutions from Stage I as supported and non-supported. A BOILP model containing 6 integer variables and 4 constraints is solved as an example to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach.

N2  - Various classifiers have been proposed for financial risk prediction. The traditional practice of using a singular performance metric for classifier evaluation is not sufficient for imbalanced classification. This paper proposes a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)-based approach to evaluate imbalanced classifiers in credit and bankruptcy risk prediction by considering multiple performance metrics simultaneously. An experimental study is designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of imbalanced classifiers using the proposed evaluation approach over seven financial imbalanced data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The TOPSIS, a well-known MCDM method, was applied to rank three categories of imbalanced classifiers using six popular evaluation criteria. The rankings results indicate that: 1) the rankings generated by the TOPSIS, which combine the results of six evaluation criteria, provide a more reasonable evaluation of imbalanced classifiers over any single performance criterion; and 2) Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)-based ensemble techniques outperform other groups of imbalanced learning approaches. Specifically, SMOTEBoost-C4.5, SMOTE-C4.5, and SMOTE-MLP were ranked as the top three classifiers based on their performances on the six criteria.

N2  - Ultra-dense network (UDN) deployment is one of the well known key technologies for enhancing the 5G network data traffic and network capacity. However, UDN deployment brings about many problems such as frequent handover, decreasing Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE). The access points' selection and handover decisions making always affected by several factors no matter we consider from the user side or from the network side. A scientific and effective execution scheme has direct influence on the overall network performance enhancement and high users' satisfaction especially in the context of ultra-dense network, where one user usually has many potentially achievable access points and the mobility is complex there. In this paper, we propose a kind of improved nonstochastic learning approach suits for the multi-objective optimization to achieve the goal of high performance and low frequency handover, by which the handover decision executes once after a given period and the user could learn the dynamic contextual competitive score (CCS) recorded during the period. We evaluate the results of the scheme by two parameters called satisfaction-ratio and handover times. The results show that users could connect to theirs reasonable access points soon without a lot of handover happens.

N2  - The present paper aims at designing and simulating a MEMS piezoelectric power generating framework by utilizing ambient pressure fluctuations. A complete design flow that includes detailed architecture, necessary dimensioning and theoretical computations are done to verify the simulated model is established using Finite element method. COMSOL Multiphysics 5.0, with its powerful engine and appalling GUI provided a major impetus for modeling and simulating the proposed design accurately. The in-built Eigen frequency analysis tool and Frequency domain analysis tool were used to establish the much needed parameters on which the whole paper is based viz - Effective volume in mm3, Power in ?W and Power density expressed in ?W/mm3. A 10150 ?m cantilever with integrated DPL type BAW resonator is used for lowering the resonant frequency. A multi-structured BAW resonator is used to synthesize enough mechanical stress at resonance such that electrical output observed at terminals is maximized. Using available resources the thickness of the active Si diaphragm is optimized within the SPL range 60-90 dB, a detailed calculation of which is presented. Test results indicated a volume of 0.0145 mm3, maximum power of 70 ?W and power density equal to 4.83 mW/mm3 at resonant frequency 140 Hz for 2.5117 g acceleration.

N2  - Skyline query has attracted much attention from the data management community. It is widely used in many practical applications, such as multi-criteria decision-making, product recommendations, and decision analysis. The range skyline query retrieves skyline results for each query point in the specified range, which means that users can set their ideal range instead of being limited to a single point. The current researchs mainly focus on the query process and answer construction of skyline. We hope to dynamically maintain the results of range skyline based on the new dominant relationship between points. In this work, we proposed a effective method for dynamically maintaining range skyline results based on range dominance relationship. Furthermore, we improved the process of generating ranke skyline results and designed a novel index named RSLayer, for the purpose of providing guidance for updating skyline results. Experiments showed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

N2  - Requirements such as integrated view of the customer or global business process integration make enterprise wide management of master data a prerequisite for achieving business goals. The master data application architecture, as a part of enterprise master data management, plays a critical role in enterprises. Choosing the right master data application architecture is a controversial subject in many enterprises. Unfortunately, the current state of the art in research does not provide sufficient guidance for enterprises dealing with this subject. The paper aims at overcoming this gap in research by presenting a decision model for supporting enterprises in the decision-making process regarding the choice of the right master data application architecture. To design the model, Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis and Design Science Research Methodology were applied. © 2014 IEEE.

N2  - Mobile Ad-Hoc networks (MANET) are widely used for data communication between mobile nodes on the digital battlefield. Clustering has evolved as an important research topic in military MANETs in reference to supporting the ability of C4I system reconfiguration in highly dynamic operation. Clustering is a process that divides the network nodes into groups according to the command system. Each cluster has a Cluster Head (CH) as a coordinator within the cluster. For policy-based MANET Cognitive Radio (CR) it is very important to have an appropriate set of policies according to the variety of specific scenarios of the data network usage. A few algorithms have been recently studied and proposed for distributed clustering. The presented algorithm is based on the multi-criteria decision using the weighted function of the main network parameters. An appropriate selection of weights values for each particular scenario is critical for the effectiveness of MANET-CR. As the simulations have shown, the number of clusters within the network and the number of nodes in the clusters determine the ability of CR adaptation according to better usage of the available spectrum resources. The performances of the proposed algorithm has been evaluated through the simulations using OMNeT++ simulator and the results are encouraging.

N2  - Existing cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tools were designed based on the policies and standards defined by organizations such as the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Frameworks such as the cybersecurity capability maturity model (C2M2) and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) are often used by the critical infrastructure owners and operators to determine the cybersecurity maturity of their facility. Although these frameworks are exceptional at performing qualitative cybersecurity analysis and identifying vulnerabilities, they do not provide a means to perform prioritized mitigation of those vulnerabilities in order to achieve a desired cybersecurity maturity. To address that challenge, we developed a framework and software application called the cybersecurity vulnerability mitigation framework through empirical paradigm (CyFEr). This paper presents the detailed architecture of CyFEr's enhanced prioritized gap analysis (EPGA) methodology and its application to CSF. The efficacy of the presented framework is demonstrated by comparing against existing similar models and testing against the cyber injects from a real-world cyber-attack that targeted industrial control systems (ICS) in critical infrastructures.

N2  - In this work, a technique for fast multi-objective design optimization of antenna structures is presented. In our approach, the initial approximation of the Pareto set representing the best possible trade-offs between conflicting design objectives is obtained by means of sequential patching of the design space. The latter is a stencil-based search that aims at creating a path that connects the extreme Pareto-optimal designs (obtained by means of single-objective optimization runs). For the sake of computational efficiency, the patching process is realized at the level of coarse-discretization EM simulation model. The final Pareto front is obtained through surrogate-based optimization, and it is reusing the EM simulation data acquired at the initial design stage. The proposed approach is demonstrated using the example of an ultrawideband monopole antenna.

N2  - Today, challenges and adventures caused by of risks on IT service providers that are the producers or suppliers of diverse IT services are burdensome. On the contrary, the advantages of using risks prediction and analysis is so high that many of IT service providers are seeking a way to predict, analyze and reduce the effects of risks. In this article, an application oriented model is presented using Failure Modes and Effects Analysis model in combination with Multi-Criteria Decision-Making models of Analytical Hierarchical Process and TOPSIS in Fuzzy environment to improve the risk evaluation of companies providing the IT services. Whilst in this model the weight of risks calculated not only on the basis of intensity, occurrence probability and risk discovery probability, but also on the basis of risk importance degree, that is its actual impact affecting the whole business, the real weight of risks will be calculated and prioritized. Meanwhile, IT establishment framework in IT service providers is considered as IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL V3) framework.

N2  - The extracted product aspects (like 'battery life', 'zoom') from online customer reviews are dissimilar in their significances, some of these aspects have a great influence on the potential customer's decision likewise on the businesses' strategies for product enhancements. Supporting the probable customers with a list of the most representative product aspects will assist their purchasing decision and facilitate the comparative process among the presented products. For the firms, identifying critical product aspects creates a new perspective of product manufacturing and marketing strategies to be competitive and innovative. However the manual identification of the most representative product aspects from the huge amounts of the extracted product aspects in online reviews is a tedious and time-consuming task. Thus, ranking the extracted aspects becomes a necessity to identify the important product aspects mentioned in the customer reviews. The purpose of this study is to formulate the product aspect ranking problem as a decision making process using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). In response, a comparative analysis between two different MCDM ranking approaches, namely; TOPSIS and VIKOR has been conducted to investigate their performances in prioritizing the most important product aspects in customer reviews. The experimental results on different product reviews demonstrate the effectiveness of these two methods in prioritizing the genuine product aspects in customer feedback.

N2  - Technology-mediated collaboration process has been extensively studied for over a decade. Most applications with collaboration concepts reported in the literature focus on enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of the decision-making processes in objective and well-structured workflows. However, relatively few previous studies have investigated the applications of collaboration schemes to problems with subjective and unstructured nature. In this paper, we explore a new intelligent collaboration scheme for fashion design which, by nature, relies heavily on human judgment and creativity. Techniques such as multicriteria decision making, fuzzy logic, and artificial neural network (ANN) models are employed. Industrial data sets are used for the analysis. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed scheme exhibits significant improvement over the traditional method in terms of the timecost effectiveness, and a company interview with design professionals has confirmed its effectiveness and significance. © 2006 IEEE.

N2  - Skyline is widely used in multi-objective decisionmaking, data visualization and other fields. With the rapid increasing of data volume, skyline of big data has also attracted more and more attention. However, skyline of big data has its own shortcomings. When the dimension increases, skyline results will be numerous, and we would like to select k points from the result sets. In this paper, we propose the top-k skyline of big data. It is a Distributed Top-k Skyline Method in MapReduce, called MR-DTKS. Firstly, we convert the multidimensional data to a single value to determine the dominance relationship of two data points. Secondly, we calculate the score by using the converted values to filter out most of unwanted data objects. Finally, we choose k data objects having the strongest dominating capacity. A large number of experiments show that our method is effective, and has good flexibility and scalability on real data sets as well as synthetic data sets.

N2  - Business Process Management (BPM) is known as a management approach that uses tools and methods to support business process analysis, project and control in an efficient manner. A prominent means by which to ensure the success of BPM is by using Information Technology (IT) tools as Business Process Management Systems (BPMS). However, the selection of a BPMS is not an easy task since there are several different types of systems, and each has its own specific characteristics. Due to the complexity of the problem, a systematic proposal, based on Multicriteria Decision Aid, is put forward for selecting BPMS considering the needs of a given organization. In order to illustrate the applicability of the proposal, two cases studies were developed, together with two different IT experts, which provided satisfactory results and evidence that the proposal is appropriate for this kind of problem.

N2  - In multicriteria decision aiding (MCDA), the Choquet integral has been used as an aggregation operator to deal with the case of interacting decision criteria. In this context, a practical problem that arises is related to the identification of the parameters associated with the Choquet integral, which are known as the Choquet capacities. In this paper, we address the problem of capacity identification by means of unsupervised learning, which, in MCDA, refers to the situations in which only the decision matrix is available. Our contribution is twofold. First, we discuss the extension of some previous works on the subject as well as some of their limitations. Then, we introduce a novel method, which is able to associate the parameters of the Choquet integral with the decision table correlation structure. As attested by numerical experiments, the proposed approach is conceptually simple to be implemented and can detect interactions between criteria in a data-driven fashion.

N2  - The use of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) by online broker to rank different service providers in the Cloud is based upon criteria provided by a customer. However, such ranking is prone to bias if the customer has insufficient domain knowledge. He/she may exclude relevant or include irrelevant criterion termed as 'misspecification of criterion'. This causes structural uncertainty within the MCDA leading to selection of suboptimal service provider by online broker. To cater such issue, we propose a self-regulatedMCDA, which uses notion of factor analysis from the field of statistics. Two QoS based datasets were used for evaluation of proposed model. The prior dataset i.e., feedback from customers, was compiled using leading review websites such as Cloud Hosting Reviews, Best Cloud Computing Providers, and Cloud Storage Reviews and Ratings. The later dataset i.e., feedback from servers, was generated from Cloud brokerage architecture that was emulated using high performance computing (HPC) cluster at University of Luxembourg (HPC @ Uni.lu). The results show better performance of proposed model as compared to its counterparts in the field. The beneficiary of the research would be enterprises that view insufficient domain knowledge as a limiting factor for acquisition of Cloud services.

N2  - Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have emerged as an important technology for monitoring of critical situations that require real-time sensing and data acquisition for decision-making purposes. Security of wireless sensor networks is a contemporary challenging issue. A significant number of various types of malicious attacks have been identified against the security of WSNs in recent times. Due to the unreliable and untrusted environments in which WSNs operate, the threat of distributed attacks against sensory resources such as power consumption, communication, and computation capabilities cannot be neglected. In this paper, a fuzzy logic based approach is proposed in the context of distributed denial of service attacks in WSNs. The proposed approach is modelled and formulated as multi-criteria decision-making problem, while considering attack detection rate and energy decay rate as the two decision criteria. Using the Dubois and Prade's fuzzy operator, a mechanism is developed to achieve the best trade-off between the two aforementioned conflicting criteria. Empirical analysis proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2014 IEEE.

N2  - The real-time data processing jointly with the decision making is permanently demanded in the current economy. The Measurement and Evaluation (ME) process represent a key asset for knowing the environment from a quantitative viewpoint. A measurement process must warranty its repeatability, consistency, and the comparability of its results. The interpretation of each result through the indicators represents a critical aspect in relation to the decision-making process. The Real-Time Data Processing Architecture based on Measurement Metadata uses a framework for automatizing the ME process. An extension of this ME framework is proposed for supporting the Stratified Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Method jointly with the updating of the architecture for supporting the indicator interpretation in different scenarios and entity's states. Further, a frequency analysis of each scenario and the entity's states are defined for giving feedback to the domain experts. Now, the indicators can be interpreted in real-time on each scenario and the entity's state jointly with the associated risks previously to make a decision.

N2  - One of the most important quality indicators of a software product is its defect rates and accordingly, Software Defect Prediction (SDP) has become a widely-accepted practice in both academia and industry to reduce the cost of defects. Despite being reported less frequently, applying SDP in the early phases of software development is even more beneficial in reducing the cost of quality. In this regard, we expect that the existence of a standard procedure or approach for evaluating and selecting a convenient method for building a prediction model in the early phases could make SDP less challenging, especially for the practitioners. Therefore, in this paper, we identify criteria to evaluate SDP methods and select the best-fit one with respect to stakeholder needs which are elicited via a questionnaire in the early phases of the development lifecycle. We consider stakeholder needs in SDP method selection which is based on multi-criteria decision analysis. We investigate the feasibility of our evaluation approach over an open dataset suitable for early SDP, which initially confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach.

N2  - Redundancy of data persistence in Data Warehouses is mostly justified with better performance when accessing data for analysis. However, there are other reasons to store data redundantly, which are often not recognized when designing data warehouses. Especially in Business Data Warehouses, data management via multiple persistence levels is necessary to condition the huge amount of data into an adequate format for its final usage. Redundant data allocates additional disk space and requires time-consuming processing and huge effort for complex maintenance. That means in reverse: avoiding data persistence leads to less effort. The question arises: What data for what purposes do really need to be stored? In this paper, we discuss decision support and evaluation approaches beyond cost-based comparisons. We use a compendium of purposes for data persistence. We define a model that includes objective indicators and subjective user preferences for decision making on data persistence in Business Data Warehouses. We develop an indicator system that enables the measurement of technical as well as business-related facts. With multi-criteria decision methodology, we present a framework to objectively compare different alternatives for data persistence. Finally, we apply our developed method to a real world Business Data Warehouse and show applicability and integration of our model in an existing system.

N2  - Recommendation systems (RS) are proposed to detect and suggest items that best meet the needs of users. Most of the existent works are based on recommendation algorithms are proposed to capture numerical data. Therefore, this may not provide consistent results (i.e. users may not have the same rating scale). The semantic web is proposed as an extension within the framework of RS in order to process data which are now the most used on the net, unstructured data (i.e. textual data). The unstructured data is used for the purpose of improving the personalization task in different application fields. As a matter of fact, textual data analysis has got the ability to reveal hidden information which enable us to further capture user's likes, preferences and interests and as a result a correct way to determine the user's profiles. However, the existing solutions unfit to take into account the multi-criteria feature of items which is essential to represent more complex user's preferences. This work proposes a text mining-based RS that exploit the users' comments in order to highlight the important criterion of the active user. Finally, the recommendation task is based on the criterion chosen thought exploiting the user's reviews. The choice of the criterion takes into consideration its importance regarding the percentage of its existence into the items reviews content. Several enhancement versions of this work were proposed that were tested on a real database extracted from the TripAdvisor website. The accuracy and quality of the recommendation has been improved considerably in this work by compared with traditional approaches.

N2  - Online auctions have becoming the most popular forms of trading on Internet. Companies have a need to provide a decision support tool that help buyer to deal with the reverse auction from suppliers. Therefore, a multi-objective decision support mechanism for reverse auction is proposed in this study. A DEA model by considering both buyers and sellers' preference that optimizes their efficiency are proposed. Each seller may revise their own bid according to suggested adjustment from our proposed decision support mechanism.

N2  - Network data analysis for Financial and Managerial applications may influence many business and IT activities. Such analysis can be useful to identify top Investors and Companies based on different criteria. Tradition approaches such as Centrality measures used in identifying top Investors and Companies. However, these approaches require high computation complexity. CrunchBase, a data platform, provides valuable information about Investors and Companies that helps to understand the behavior of peoples, their interest and can predict future investments using the graph-based tools like Neo4j. This research aims to use CrunchBase dataset and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approaches i.e. TOPSIS and Majority Voting to identify top-k Investor and Companies. In addition, proposed an efficient approach using Correlation-based Feature Weighting (CFW) for MCDM approaches. Experimental results show that proposed approaches provide scalability and perform better in terms of accuracy compared to state of-the-art approaches.

N2  - SMB Telkom University annually organizes roadshow visits to high schools in Indonesia as one of the marketing strategies of new student recruitment activities which are their responsibility. Admission Manager as a key person in SMB Telkom University has two assistants to make sure this program is work nicely. In its implementation, they have limitations, such as limited financial budgets, limited marketing staff, and lack of time; hence, they cannot visit all the high school. But it is too complicated in their attempt to filter out the potential high schools. First, criteria weight score should have already inputted by Admission Manager and the school data have to be inputted by Data and Analysis Assistant Manager include their perform score based on the criteria. Later, Marketing and Public Relations Assistant Manager must calculate that data manually using Weighted Sum Model Method (WSM) to get the value of the potential score of each high school. Then the potential score is sorted manually from the highest to the lowest score. All actions and all users using a single worksheet. This web application act as a Decision Support System (DSS). It prevents Data and Analysis Assistant Manager input the same school twice, it prevents all the data deleted by accident, it prevents Marketing and Public Relations Assistant Manager wasting time to calculate the potential value of each high school. This web application will sort that WSM method results into a priority list of high school automatically and give information add-on such as the school's phone number and where is the school Address, even it gives a direction map. Last but not least it is also has a much friendlier interface than a worksheet.

N2  - In the fields of computer vision and image processing, edge detection refers to the identification and localization of significant changes in a digital image. This article presents a survey of widely-used edge detection techniques including linear approaches, morpohlogical operations, multi-resolution analysis, and machine learning methods. Since there exists no single method that is applicable in all situations, different methods are deployed for different applications. A hierarchical framework based on multiple criteria has been proposed here that can facilitate the process of selecting the most appropriate edge detection method in a given scenario. Use of the proposed framework has been explained through an example of medical images. Finally, possible areas for further exploration have been highlighted. © 2013 IEEE.

The application includes 11 of the 26 states of Brazil and 9 criteria. Results show that applying the classification method to the public safety context is useful because it provides a quantitative systematic way to classify Brazilian states regarding violence parameters and then to apply the most suitable public safety policies guided by this classification.

N2  - Additive manufacturing (AM) has become popular in various fields, not only for industrial use, but also for personal use due to its key advantages in almost unlimited design freedom and material efficiency. Manufacturers in the industry recognize AM as a promising method in direct digital manufacturing for their design, research and development, and production processes. However, the applicability of AM technology is limited due to its process instability from several factors including the orientation selection of the part. Orientation of a part refers to the building direction with respect to the part being fabricated by the AM machine. In addition, available quantitative methods to determine the part orientation are limited. In this paper, we examine the part orientation alternatives' efficiency using data envelopment analysis (DEA). We illustrate a case study for one AM process; fused deposition modeling (FDM). The orientation alternatives' efficiency is identified and presented through trade-offs among conflicting criteria and machines. By using the DEA analysis, it provides insights regarding efficiency of each alternative, which can be used for the benchmarking leading to a best-practice frontier. The proposed method can be applied to other AM technologies in the industrial AM-based production environments for effective management.

N2  - The proliferation of cloud computing has revolutionized the hosting and delivery of Internet-based application services. However, with the constant launch of new cloud services and capabilities almost every month by both big (e.g., Amazon Web Service and Microsoft Azure) and small companies (e.g., Rackspace and Ninefold), decision makers (e.g., application developers and chief information officers) are likely to be overwhelmed by choices available. The decision-making problem is further complicated due to heterogeneous service configurations and application provisioning QoS constraints. To address this hard challenge, in our previous work, we developed a semiautomated, extensible, and ontology-based approach to infrastructure service discovery and selection only based on design-time constraints (e.g., the renting cost, the data center location, the service feature, etc.). In this paper, we extend our approach to include the real-time (run-time) QoS (the end-to-end message latency and the end-to-end message throughput) in the decision-making process. The hosting of next-generation applications in the domain of online interactive gaming, large-scale sensor analytics, and real-time mobile applications on cloud services necessitates the optimization of such real-time QoS constraints for meeting service-level agreements. To this end, we present a real-time QoS-aware multicriteria decision-making technique that builds over the well-known analytic hierarchy process method. The proposed technique is applicable to selecting Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud offers, and it allows users to define multiple design-time and real-time QoS constraints or requirements. These requirements are then matched against our knowledge base to compute the possible best fit combinations of cloud services at the IaaS layer. We conducted extensive experiments to prove the feasibility of our approach.

N2  - In the process of flood control operation of multi-objective reservoirs in flood season, it is necessary to select the best from feasible alternatives through comparison and filter. Because of the contradiction among objectives, which used to evaluate and select the satisfying alternative, the difficulty in assessing the weights of objectives, and the uncertainty of flood data, the selection is a multi-criteria and subjectivity problem under fuzzy environments. This paper applies fuzzy optimum neural networks to solve multi-criteria decision making problems and presents a new method to construct the training set for neural networks. First, the criterion set and its relative membership degree matrix are established for the evaluation of alternatives. Next, neural networks are trained with training set, which are constructed by the new method presented in this paper. And then substitute the candidate alternatives into the neural networks. The ranking of alternatives and the best one can be determined directly on the basis of the output of neural networks. The optimization process is simple and easy to use in practice. A case study shows that the method is reasonable and effective.

N2  - With the advent of Cloud computing and subsequent big data, online decision makers usually find it difficult to make informed decisions because of the great amount of irrelevant, uncertain, or inaccurate information. In this paper, we explore the application of multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques in the area of Cloud computing and big data, to find an efficient way of dealing with criteria relations and fuzzy knowledge based on a great deal of information. We propose a MCDM framework, which combines the ISM-based and ANP-based techniques, to model the interactive relations between evaluation criteria, and to handle data uncertainties. We present an application of Cloud service selection to prove the efficiency of the proposed framework, in which a user-oriented sigmoid utility function is designed to evaluate the performance of each criterion.

N2  - A design tool for simultaneous structure design optimization of multiple car models is developed and applied to simultaneous design optimization of MAZDA CX-5 (SUV car), MAZDA6 wagon (large car), and MAZDA3 hatchback (small car) to demonstrate feasibility of the developed design tool. This problem is a multiobjective design optimization problem where the objectives are minimization of total weight of three car models and maximization of number of common thickness parts. To find the nondominated designs efficiently, an evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm named Cheetah is adopted. For analysis of the obtained nondominated and dominated designs, an interactive data mining tool iSPM is used. To evaluate crash performances accurately, a finite-element software LS-DYNA is used for each crash mode. To overcome difficulty in computational time, the K computer is used, where the required computational time is more than 360 hours using 73,728 cores of the K computer. As a result, many designs that outperform the initial design developed by Mazda Motor Corporation are found. In addition, the obtained nondominated designs reveal the trade-off between the two design objectives of the simultaneous structure design optimization problem of multiple car models.

N2  - Traditionnally, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) literature has devoted its effort to the evaluation and recommandation stage of decision analysis. A MCDM problem in this context is therefore completly determined by a table where the entry at a position of this table corresponds to the value of a criterion for the corresponding action and the main purpose for the analyst is to design a procedure that derive an order or pre-order over the actions set from that data table. This framework does have some drawbacks in practice such as the necessity for actions to be evaluated through the same criteria and one objective to realize. In this communication we go further ahead to consider also elecitation and measurement stage and derive a framework that allows also inhomogeneity of attributes that will characterize actions with regard to pursued multiobjectives. A case study in infrastructures projects portfolio selection under fund constraints to enhance suistainable development is considered as an illustrative application of the developped approach.

N2  - In this paper we present an algorithm designed to train a multi-criteria decision system. This kind of system is very important and used a lot in different military fields and, particularly in cyber-defense. We developed this algorithm to be used with different multi-agent detection systems. The MASFAD system is a typical example [1]. It is a multi-agent system for Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) detection. In this paper we compare different optimization methods for learning Weighted Ordered Weighted Averaging (WOWA) coefficients in order to perform a binary classification. The WOWA function is an aggregation function that is a generalization of OrderedWeighted Averaging (OWA) and the Weighted mean. The WOWA operator combines both of their advantages The learning part is based on a Genetic Algorithm and uses a training dataset. We perform a complete parameter study and we determine the efficiency of our model by evaluating the performance during the classification of different PHP files as webshells or normal files. These PHP files were previously analyzed by a program developed at the Royal Military Academy. We obtain very accurate results and a good stability during the decision process. This system could be used in a lot of different fields.

N2  - Multi objective (MO) design space exploration (DSE) in high level synthesis (HLS) is a tedious task which administers the usage of intelligent decision making strategies at multiple stages to yield quality results. The problem of DSE becomes intractable and intricate when an auxiliary variable such as loop unrolling factor plays a vital role in the decision making process. This paper successfully solves the above problem by proposing the novel DSE approach for fully automated parallel (simultaneous) exploration of optimal datapath and unrolling factor (UF) during area-performance tradeoff in HLS. The proposed DSE approach is driven by hyper-dimensional particle swarm optimization (PSO). The major sub-contributions of this proposed algorithm includes: a) deriving a model for computation of execution delay of a loop unrolled control data flow graph (CDFG) based on resource constraint, without the necessity of tediously unrolling the entire CDFG in most cases, b) Consideration of loop unrolling and its impact on: i) control states and execution delay tradeoff during loop unrolling ii) area-execution delay tradeoff during the DSE process, c) novel comparative results for area-performance tradeoff with respect to multiple DFG and CDFG benchmarks. Results of the proposed approach indicated an average improvement in Quality of Results (QoR) of > 30% and reduction in runtime of > 92% compared to recent approaches.

N2  - This paper aims in presenting the optimal placement of the Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) of an IEEE-5 bus system. In this paper a simplest scheme for dynamic vulnerability assessment based on Power System Loss Index has been proposed for Optimal PMU placement and which is compared against the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Techniques namely Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Fuzzy AHP approach and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach. MCDM helps in finding the best solution among the multiple alternatives for the placement of PMU which is based on the weighing factor. But this MCDM has neglected the dynamic operation of the system. In the proposed scheme, the probabilistic nature of network dynamics is performed by Monte Carlo Simulation to iteratively evaluate the system performance for probable input parameter variations such as load variation, generation variation and list of credible contingencies to assess the vulnerability index of the system. Newton - Raphson load flow analysis is performed for each contingency and the power system losses in various parts of the networks are observed. The vulnerability Index is calculated based on total Power System Loss (PSL). Based on the index, the vulnerable regions in the power system network are identified and clustered with the help of Data clustering algorithm. The PMUs have to be located in the most vulnerable regions to prevent the system from blackouts and to take corrective control actions. This proposed simple approach is tested on IEEE-5 Bus test systems. The test result shows that PSL index is effective in identifying the vulnerable regions for optimal PMU placement. The findings of the PMU location are compared against MCDM techniques.

N2  - Return on Equity (ROE) is an important factor from the perspective of formulating and implementing a company's financial strategies. It is also one of its evaluation criteria. It presents to investors the effectiveness of using their capital. Increasing profitability may be treated as a symptom of shareholder wealth, while its reduction may be a signal indicating a deterioration of the financial situation of the company. An investment in a company will be attractive to investors if the results obtained by it will enable the benefit from the dividend to be paid and if the share prices will show an upward trend. Therefore, profit and profitability are categories dependent on the company and affect the wealth of its owners. The ROE ratio is synthetic and is linked to, among others with the size of sales, asset use activity, and the size of the company's debt. However, the decisions regarding the capital structure of a company should be made not only by purely economic and financial analyses but also should take into account the social and environmental effects of economic activities. To take into account not only short-term financial goals but also long-term sustainable development goals during the decision-making process, we need intelligent and creative multi-criteria decision support tools. Bio-inspired artificial intelligence techniques - such as evolutionary algorithms, deep neural networks, or swarm algorithms, to give only a few examples - are gaining more and more popularity in the recent years. Evolutionary algorithms are optimization techniques that are modeled on the processes of evolution that are taking place in natural populations. They can find approximate solutions to the NP-hard global, multi-modal, and multi-objective optimization problems. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach - an agent-based bio-inspired system supporting decisions in the area of corporate finance, which takes into account not only financial goals but also the sustainable development goals. The system will allow for multi-objective optimization with the use of bio-inspired algorithms. In this paper, we will concentrate on one module of the proposed system - the evolutionary algorithm optimizing the ROE factor. During the experiments, we will verify the ability of the proposed algorithm to provide decision makers with reasonable, useful, and, at the same time, also innovative and non-obvious solutions concerning the desired capital structure of a given company, which usually operates in a rapidly changing environment. The proposed system will allow for taking into account more than one criteria and perform multi-objective optimization with the use of an evolutionary algorithm or an agent-based co-evolutionary algorithm, so it will be possible to include also the long-term goals of sustainable development in the future.

N2  - With the rapid development of modern teaching technology, the construction of smart campus has become the focus of modern college education reform. The application of technologies, such as the Internet of Things and big data, plays an important role in improving the teaching environment of colleges and universities, improving the utilization of teaching resources, and the flexibility of education. As an important part of campus activities, teaching performance evaluation scientifically and effectively utilizes teaching information and teacher and student interaction information to evaluate teachers' teaching performance, which helps to motivate teachers' work enthusiasm, improve teaching quality, and enhance school core competitiveness. This paper analyzes the salient features of smart campus from the perspectives of technology, business, and construction mode, and proposes a smart campus architecture model. According to the research content of teaching performance evaluation, the framework model of smart campus education data collection and storage platform is established, which provides a reference model for the construction of smart campus in colleges and universities. The evaluation of teaching performance in smart campus first analyzes the shortcomings of traditional evaluation methods and proposes the necessity of combining teaching performance evaluation with modern technology. Second, six principal components were determined using the PCA algorithm. Then, use the AHP to calculate the weights of each layer of the indicator set, avoiding the decision errors caused by subjective factors. Finally, the gray correlation degree is used to improve the TOPSIS algorithm for multi-objective decision analysis. The evaluation results of the AHP-TOPSIS teaching performance model are consistent with the actual situation. The application of the smart campus education data platform combined with the AHP and the gray correlation improvement TOPSIS algorithm is more targeted to the teacher's teaching performance evaluation and provides a new evaluation method for scientific performance evaluation, and avoid the problem of strong subjectivity of traditional teaching performance evaluation.

N2  - Selection of site is the most fundamental and crucial decision, in the process of setting up a solar power plant. Since several factors influence the site selection process, multi criteria analysis is used to resolve this problem. In this study, seven districts of Rajasthan in India are considered as different alternatives for the installation of solar power plant. They are evaluated over few crucial criteria's such as solar radiation, land availability, water availability, cost of land, population benefitted, transmission losses and number of rainy days, which have a great impact on power generation. As the data corresponding to the criteria's considered is not available, thematic map is used as the raw data, with Arc GIS as interface, baseline data, corresponding to the criteria's for all study areas is extracted. A multi-criteria decision making technique, is used to choose the best suitable site for installation of solar power plant. Based on the literature, Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP), which is advanced and a simple method, is used in this study for the location allocation of solar plant. Results dictate that Bikaner, which is one among the alternatives considered, is the optimal site for the installation for the solar plant in Rajasthan.

N2  - Transport network infrastructure including the use of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) is fundamental to the mobility of people and shipments. This study aims at understanding how different ITS measures may impact multiple traffic engineering goals with respect to a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The ordering of KPIs is determined by the preferences of the decision maker. A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis framework is proposed for impact assessments of ITS measures. Data about KPIs is derived with the help of traffic data gathered from the Gothenburg Region. Comparing the contributions of ITS measures to different goals suggest that the management of flow and speed in a road network is crucial for improving capacity utilisation. The goal assessments are then projected onto different use-cases in terms of socio-economic impacts. The result indicates that corridor section traffic management, transport management (focusing on transit traffic) and urban gate-way will generate socioeconomic effects, respectively, in a decreasing order. Urban gateway is particularly interesting because it is the least intrusive and less costly use-case.

N2  - Thesauri are knowledge systems which may ease Big Data access, fostering their integration and re-use. Currently several Linked Data thesauri covering multi-disciplines are available. They provide a semantic foundation to effectively support cross-organization and cross-disciplinary management and usage of Big Data. Thesauri effectiveness is affected by their quality. Diverse quality measures are available taking into account different facets. However, an overall measure is needed to compare several thesauri and to identify those more qualified for a proper reuse. In this paper, we propose a Multi Criteria Decision Making based methodology for the documentation of the quality assessment of linked thesauri as a whole. We present a proof of concept of the Analytic Hierarchy Process adoption to the set of Linked Data thesauri for the Environment deployed in LusTRE. We discuss the step-by-step practice to document the overall quality measurements, generated by the quality assessment, with the W3C promoted Data Quality Vocabulary.

N2  - The continuous pursue of sustainable manufacturing is motivating the
utilization of new advanced technology, especially for hard to cut
materials. In this study, an adaptive approach for optimization of
machining process of AISI 4340 using wiper inserts is proposed. This
approach is based on advance yet intuitive modeling and optimization
techniques. The approach is based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN),
Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA), as well as Linear Programming
Techniques for Multidimensional Analysis of Preference (LINMAP), for
modeling, optimization and multi-criteria decision making respectively.
This integrated approach, to best of the authors' knowledge, has been
deployed for the first time to adaptively serve different designs of
manufacturing processes. Such designs have different orientations,
namely cost, quality, productivity, and balanced orientation. The
capability of the proposed approach to serving such diverse requirements
answers one of the most accelerating demands in the manufacturing
community due to the dynamics of the uprising smart production lines.
Besides, the proposed approach is presented in a straightforward manner
that can be extended easily to other design orientations as well as
other engineering applications. Based on the proposed design, a balanced
general setting of 197.4 m/min, 0.95 mm, and 0.168 mm/rev was
recommended along with other settings for more sophisticated
requirements. Confirmatory experiments showed a good agreement (i.e., no
more than 7% deviation) with the predicted optimum responses. This
shows the validity of the proposed approach as a viable tool for
designers to promote holistic and sustainable process design.

N2  - A simple yet robust methodology for rapid multiobjective design optimization of antenna structures has been presented. The key component of our approach is sequential domain patching of the design space, which is a stencil-based search that aims at creating a path that connects the extreme Pareto-optimal designs, obtained by means of single-objective optimization runs. The patching process yields the initial approximation of the Pareto set representing the best possible tradeoffs between conflicting design objectives. It is realized-for the sake of computational efficiency-at the level of coarse-discretization electromagnetic (EM) simulation model. The final Pareto front is subsequently obtained using surrogate-assisted optimization where the EM simulation data acquired at the initial design stage is reused.

N2  - Reputation evaluation plays an important role in determining the credibility of online entities. Especially in e-commerce systems, consumers usually give priority to this indicator when choosing vendors. Reputation bootstrapping, which can determine the default reputation value of new entities, is still a challenging problem. Most current bootstrapping methods fail to consider the complexity, the ambiguity of trust, or the reputation and internal correlation characteristics of influential factors in the prediction process. Therefore, in this paper, a novel reputation bootstrapping model that combines the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method with neural network prediction is established. First, we adopt a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making model, named fuzzy DEMATEL method to discuss the intrinsic causal relationships between influential factors and identify the critical success factors (CSFs) for reputation estimation. Then, we adopt back propagation (BP) neural network to generalize the correlations between the CSFs and the initial reputation value. Finally, a case study is constructed to verify the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model has better accuracy and efficiency compared with other reputation bootstrapping methods.

N2  - In the recent era, multi-criteria decision making under uncertainty is gaining importance due to its wide range of applicability. Among several types of uncertainty handling techniques, Robust Optimization (RO) is considered as an efficient and tractable approach provided one has accessibility to data in uncertain regions. However, solutions of RO may actually deviate from actual results in real scenarios, due to conservative sampling. This paper proposes a methodology to amalgamate unsupervised machine learning algorithms with RO which thereby makes it data-driven. A novel evolutionary fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to transcript the uncertain space such that the exact regions of uncertainty are identified. Subsequently, density based boundary point detection and Delaunay triangulation based boundary construction enables intelligent Sobol based sampling in these regions for use in RO. Results of two test cases with varying dimensions are presented along with a comprehensive comparison between conventional RO approach using box uncertainty set and proposed methodology. Considered case studies include highly nonlinear real life model for continuous casting from steelmaking industries, where a time expensive multi-objective optimization problem under uncertainty is formulated to resolve the conflict in productivity and energy consumption. Optimal Artificial Neural Network (ANN) surrogate assisted optimization under uncertainty for casting model is performed to obtain solutions in realistic time. The resulting RO problem being multi-objective in nature, the Pareto solutions are obtained by NSGA II.

N2  - Currently, most spatial decision support systems are based on models that take into account one criteria functions representing the preferences of decision makers. However, they are often faced with complex situations. Since only one function cannot adequately capture all the information necessary for the decision making process, it is natural that we consider the MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) as a tool for integrating multiple decision criteria. The MCDA suggests methods that provide the ability to accommodate a variety of conflicting factors. In this paper, we propose an approach of decision making support that is based on linking the MCDA to the SOLAP process (Spatial Online Analytical Processing), an essential component of the spatial decision support systems analysis. The testing of SOLAP process demonstrated that there exists a shortage in the consideration of the multicriteria aspect. Therefore, it is imperative to integrate multicriteria decision analysis for the expansion of the capabilities of SOLAP process in order that we could make the right decision. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - Regression analysis is one of the techniques of data mining and is used to generate futuristic model for a given problem. One of the major challenge in the study of Regression analysis is to reduce the Outlier values. But the inherent complex and flexible nature of web data makes it difficult for various regression algorithms to propose an ideal futuristic model. This paper discusses a method that tries to reduce Outlier values by using a variant of Ordered Weighted Operators. First, a regression problem will be formulated and then it will be converted into a Multi-criteria decision making problem. Results, thus obtained will show that the outliers can be reduced to a significant extent by proper use of these operators.

N2  - Extending the electrical grid for distant areas that are inadequately electrified is not financially viable and certainly not likely to happen in the short to medium term. Remote areas with potential renewable energy sources are possible to power a micro-grid that could supply their unelectrified area. The use of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology in this study provided an efficient tool in identifying potential hydropower with effective determination of the parameters from the actual field measurements and utilization of the high resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Similarly, the application of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods in the analysis of processed geospatial data was proven capable in finding the optimal site location for hydropower in the remote area of Rogongon, Iligan City. The result suggested that the proposed integration of GIS-MCDM was successful in providing a robust model for decision making of renewable energy location.

N2  - In this paper, the existing methods of multi-criteria decision making for selecting a rational IoT platform when designing IoT systems are considered. The complexity of the selection process is due to the large number of platforms, available on the IoT services market, and the variety of services and features, which they offer. Therefore, the task of selecting a rational IoT platform is very relevant today. This paper presents the application linear convolution and multiplicative convolution methods using two different approaches to forming weight coefficients for criteria: simple ranking and proportional. In addition, the analysis and research of the influence of various methods of multi-criteria decision making on the result of selecting a rational IoT platform have been carried out. The comparative results confirm the appropriateness of the use of the corresponding methods for solving the multi-criteria decision making task, which deals with a selection of the most rational IoT platform in special cases. Properly selected IoT platform allows increasing reliability and safety of the IoT systems for human and industry domains.

N2  - Python has become the programming language of choice for research and industry projects related to data science, machine learning, and deep learning. Since optimization is an inherent part of these research fields, more optimization related frameworks have arisen in the past few years. Only a few of them support optimization of multiple conflicting objectives at a time, but do not provide comprehensive tools for a complete multi-objective optimization task. To address this issue, we have developed pymoo, a multi-objective optimization framework in Python. We provide a guide to getting started with our framework by demonstrating the implementation of an exemplary constrained multiobjective optimization scenario. Moreover, we give a high-level overview of the architecture of pymoo to show its capabilities followed by an explanation of each module and its corresponding sub-modules. The implementations in our framework are customizable and algorithms can be modified/extended by supplying custom operators. Moreover, a variety of single, multi and many-objective test problems are provided and gradients can be retrieved by automatic differentiation out of the box. Also, pymoo addresses practical needs, such as the parallelization of function evaluations, methods to visualize low and high-dimensional spaces, and tools for multi-criteria decision making.

We propose a sensor data prioritization approach based on user requirements for maximizing the satisfaction value. The approach utilizes an MCDA (Multi Criteria Decision Analysis) technique called REMBRANDT to aggregate requirements and to determine a single priority value over sensor data with different attributes. Through a building management system case study, we have shown that our method can obtain higher satisfaction than naive transmission strategies in practical situations.

N2  - One of the most important factors in the success of a business is its location, therefore the problem of identifying an optimal site for a new commercial opening has remained the focus of the research community. The ideal business site depends on many criteria including competitors, ease of access, traffic condition, etc. Precisely, optimal business site selection is a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem, which deals with the selection of the best alternative from several potential candidates based on several criteria. In this work we present an AHP/TOPSIS hybrid approach to identify an optimal site for a commercial opening, given a set a candidate sites. Both the AHP and TOPSIS are MCDM methods, however the hybrid approach is chosen as it results in the reduction of the computational complexity, and the reduction in the manual effort required in the construction of the AHP pairwise comparison matrices. The proposed approach ranks all the candidate sites based on their performance scores and the candidate with the highest score is identified as the optimal site. A nexus of complex factors such as competition in the area, traffic conditions, and area popularity are considered for ranking the candidates, where the factor values are computed with the assistance of real GeoSpatial data. The proposed approach is flexible and can effectively incorporate any number of factors to rank the candidates. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is proved with the help of a case study to identify an optimal location for a new gas station in the New York City.

N2  - Decision support systems (DSSs) are playing an increasingly important role in the characterization of suspicious activities in an area of interest given their proved ability to turn vast amounts of raw data into actionable intelligence that is easy to understand by human operators. Although risk management is an integral component of the decision making process that directly contributes towards improved situational awareness and response assessment, an active end-to-end consideration of the underlying risk sources in the environment is still an important feature that most DSSs currently lack. Additionally, deciding on an appropriate course of action (COA) to mitigate emerging threats in the system is a challenging task even for domain experts given that (1) the number of potential responses to analyze could be overwhelmingly large; (2) seldom are those responses judged in terms of the risks associated with their enactment and (3) assessing the effectiveness of the potential responses in the real world is usually time-consuming and simulation-driven. In this paper, we formalize the adaptation of a recently proposed Risk Management Framework to account for behavioral intents associated with the objects of interest (OOIs) in the monitoring environment and their link to automatic response generation. The intent of the objects is inferred from high-level cognitive and behavioral knowledge in the form of anomalies. When an OOI has crossed a permissible risk threshold, we demonstrate how responses to that situation can be automatically elicited by the COA recommendation module of a risk-aware DSS. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is used to judge a diverse set of plausible responses according to different operational objectives. We illustrate the application of the proposed framework in the context of maritime surveillance operations by triggering a corporate search for a missing vessel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that risk features are synthesized from anomalies and integrated into a more comprehensive RMF engine for knowledge (response) elicitation.

N2  - Humongous contextual data are produced by sensing and computing devices (nodes) in distributed computing environments supporting inferential/predictive analytics. Nodes locally process and execute analytics tasks over contextual data. Demanding inferential analytics are crucial for supporting local real-time applications, however, they deplete nodes' resources. We contribute with a distributed methodology that pushes the task allocation decision at the network edge by intelligently scheduling and distributing analytics tasks among nodes. Each node autonomously decides whether the tasks are conditionally executed locally, or in networked neighboring nodes, or delegated to the Cloud based on the current nodes' context and statistical data relevance. We comprehensively evaluate our methodology demonstrating its applicability in edge computing environments.

N2  - Trust and reputation systems represent a significant trend in decision support including selection of best match cloud providers to process Big Data. Reputation is often considered as a collective measure of trustworthiness based on the referrals or ratings from members in a community. Reputation systems have been applied in various applications such as online service provision. However, reputation models do not reflect user's quality of service (QoS) preferences and thus they might not be satisfied with the recommendations from others. In this paper, we propose a de-centralized reputation-based trust model that incorporates the user QoS preferences to select the best match Cloud Service Provider to process Big Data. Our trust model relies on three multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) methods including Simple Additive Weighting (SAW), Weighted Product Method (WPM), and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). We conducted several experiments using simulated cloud environment to validate our trust model and assess the three MADM methods. The results show that the proposed model is pliable to users' requirements and efficiently evaluate trust of cloud providers.

There is thus a need for an approach that can handle these criteria. Besides, as supply chains are becoming more complex these days, it is also important to incorporate supply risks in the evaluation of the suppliers. This paper offers an approach that mainly focuses on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to analyze and compare the relative efficiencies of the suppliers. Since DEA can only handle quantitative attributes, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is being utilized to help to analyze qualitative analysis. Risks are also being considered in the evaluation of the suppliers. The proposed approach seeks to offer a holistic approach to tackle the Supplier Selection problem.

N2  - Many companies around the world rely on RD to better their chances for profit and permanence in a dynamic market. To keep up with ongoing changes, many ideas arise and some transform into projects. Since resources are limited, organizations seek to select only the most suitable projects to meet their objectives. This is an old practice. However, project portfolio characteristics have changed. The portfolio objectives of today go beyond profit: strategy, environment and society have also become important, along with many other decision criteria. Computational power has also been enhanced, making multi-data decision approaches more feasible, even for small-profit organizations. In the last half century, many authors have proposed multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods for project portfolio selection (PPS) for Research and Development (RD). Nevertheless, only a few paid due importance to the criteria used, which would be a central issue on any multicriteria decision. Thus, in order to contribute to the RD PPS field of study, this work investigates the hypothesis that the criteria used in RD PPS can be selected in an uncertain environment, according to their influence and importance. To do so, we propose a novel MCDM approach for criteria selection, that integrates Fuzzy-based DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) and Fuzzy-AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) Extend Analysis methods. We are also presenting a case study for a representative electrical-public Brazilian RD organization, that from 2008 to 2018 managed RD project portfolios valued at around US1.2 billion. The results reflect current Brazilian concerns on the prioritized criteria, such as environmental, social and technical criteria, especially on the face of the disaster occurrences that took place on the media on the last years. In an overall manner, the results provide guidance on the topic and facilitate knowledge accumulation and creation concerning the criteria selection process in MCDM-based RD PPS.

N2  - A new evolutionary-learning algorithm is proposed to learn a decision maker (DM)'s best solution on a conflicting multiobjective space. Given the exemplary pairwise comparisons of solutions by a DM, we learn an ideal point (for the DM) that is used to evolve toward a better set of solutions. The process is repeated to get the DM's best solution. The comparison of solutions in pairs facilitates the process of eliciting training information for the proposed learning model. Experimental study on standard multiobjective data sets shows that the proposed method accurately identifies a DM's preferred zone in relatively a few generations and with a small number of preferences. Besides, it is found to be robust to inconsistencies in the preference statements. The results obtained are validated through a variant of the established NSGA-2 algorithm.

N2  - Skyline queries are useful in many applications such as multicriteria decision-making, data mining, and user-preference queries. However, the probability that a point dominates another one reduces significantly as the number of dimensions increases, which results in the number of skyline points becoming too numerous to offer any interesting insights. The concept of the k-dominant skyline was previously proposed to solve this problem. A point p is said to k-dominate another point q if there are k (≤ d) dimensions in which p is better than or equal to q and is better in at least one of these k dimensions. A point that is not k-dominated by any other points is in the k-dominant skyline. This paper addresses the problem of computing the k-dominant skyline. By analyzing the properties of the k-dominant skyline, four lemmas are derived to reduce the effort required to select candidates and prune false positives during the computation. A set of experiments showed that our method can efficiently compute the k-dominant skyline for independent, correlated and anticorrelated datasets.

N2  - Multi-criteria decision making under uncertainty is a common practice followed in industries and academia. Among several types of uncertainty handling techniques, Chance Constrained Programming (CCP) is considered as an efficient and tractable approach provided one has accessibility to distribution of the data for uncertain parameters. However, the assumption that the uncertain parameters must follow some well-behaved probability distribution is a myth for most of the practical applications. This paper proposes a methodology to amalgamate machine learning algorithms with CCP and thereby make it data-driven. A novel fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to transcript the uncertain space such that the exact regions of uncertainty are identified. Subsequently, density based boundary point detection and Delaunay triangulation based boundary construction enable intelligent Sobol based sampling in these regions for use in CCP. The Fuzzy clustering mechanism used in the proposed method transforms the existing fuzzy C-means technique such that the decision variables are significantly reduced. This enables evolutionary optimizers to obtain better approximations of the uncertain space by identifying the true clusters. A highly nonlinear real life model for continuous casting from steelmaking industries is considered as a case study for testing the efficiency of data based CCP along with a comprehensive comparison between conventional CCP approach using box uncertainty set and proposed methodology. As the resulting CCP problem is multi-objective in nature, the Pareto solutions are obtained by NSGA II.

N2  - Skyline computation is relevant in multi-criteria decision making where the criteria are inversely proportional to each other. Skyline is generally computed using dominance analysis and applicable in a situation where shortest distance is computed with respect to a point of importance. In real life scenarios different cost parameters are obviously high for the points which are designated as 'important' where as users search for the points which are generally of low cost. These types of inverse conditions are managed in skyline computation. Existing research works majorly apply shortest distance calculation for searching the points of importance and it is assumed that the points are connected without any obstructions. However in practical cases this assumption is often wrong as different obstacles or barriers exist between the points or places. In this research work we use Taxicab distance calculation to consider the presence of obstacles and apply it to compute skyline of geographically dispersed data.

N2  - Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices produce massive amounts of data, which are especially valuable when shared between businesses. However, adoption of platforms that facilitate IoT data sharing is still low. Generic literature on interorganizational systems suggests a plethora of adoption factors, but typically focuses on data sharing between pairs of organizations. In a context of ecosystems, data governance becomes important, but its relative importance as an adoption factor is yet unclear. In this paper, we examine the perception of IoT data providers regarding the relative importance of ecosystem data governance as an adoption factor, in comparison with generic adoption factors. Our study is situated in the horticulture domain, where data sharing potentially is highly valuable. We conduct a multi-criteria decision-analysis survey using the best-worst method (BWM), complemented with interviews for interpreting findings. We find that businesses consider a large variety of factors equally important. Ecosystem data governance is in the middle-range, whereas factors like benefits and readiness are most important. At the same time, out of all adoption factors that platform providers can control directly, ecosystem data governance ranks among the highest. Our findings are important for informing data platform operators on what design issues to consider, in order to attract data owners. Managerial relevance statement Internet-of-Things is generating large amounts of data about production processes, but most data remains unused. When businesses would share data with other businesses in their ecosystem, value can be created, for instance enabling benchmarking. Platforms are emerging in the market that facilitate data sharing in ecosystems, but little is known on how businesses make choices on whether to adopt these platforms. This study shows that the most important consideration is whether they expect to derive benefits from sharing data, followed by concerns over having the appropriate resources to share data. Ecosystem data governance-that is, exercising control over who can access data in which way-turns out to be a relatively important factor. For providers of data sharing platforms that want to attract data owners, we recommend to (1) offer training and consultancy to businesses to improve their readiness to share data; (2) address technological design issues of security and ease-of-use; (3) exercise ecosystem data governance to enhance trust of businesses in sharing data.

N2  - The execution of industrial projects is subject to uncertainties that cause deviations from the designated project schedules. Therefore, it is desired to generate robust schedules in the sense of being insensitive to project disruptions, such as deviations in activity durations. Beyond that, efficient schedules that offer high robustness at a low cost are preferred. This paper focuses on the discrete time-cost tradeoff problem and develops a new method for identifying and ranking efficient schedules. First, a large schedule pool with robust schedules is generated. Efficient schedules are then identified and ranked by applying data envelopment analysis (DEA) with a particular super-efficiency model. An extensive evaluation based on a project testbed and an example construction project shows that the proposed method finds and ranks efficient schedules, that can be suitably presented to a project manager for decision support.

N2  - Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide ubiquitous, continuous and reliable positioning, navigation and timing information around the world. However, GNSS space segment design decisions have been based on the precursor Global Positioning System (GPS), which was designed in the 70s. This paper revisits those early design decisions in view of major technological advancements and new GNSS environmental threats. The rich tradespace between User Navigation Error (UNE) performance and constellation deployment costs is explored and conclusions are complemented by sensitivity analysis and association rule mining. This study finds that constellations at an orbit altitude of ~2 Earth radii can outperform existing GNSS in terms of cost, robustness and UNE. These insights should be taken into account when designing future generations of GNSS.

The aim of this paper is to solve this complicated supplier selection problem by analyzing several Geostationary Transfer Orbit launch vehicle alternatives, which have very high costs measured in million dollars. For this purpose, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is utilized and the results are compared with two popular Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) tools namely, AHP and PROMETHEE. The results indicate that all applied methods ranked the same alternative as the best. However, such a strong consensus is not observed for the worst alternative. In this context, DEA seems to determine the best alternative using less information compared to AHP and PROMETHEE.

N2  - Although tubular permanent-magnet motors have advantages such as remarkable force capability and high efficiency due to lack of end winding, they suffer from high thrust force ripple. This paper presents the use of Taguchi method and artificial neural network (ANN) for shape optimization of axially magnetized tubular linear permanent-magnet (TLPM) motors. A multiobjective design optimization is presented to improve force ripple, developed thrust, and permanent-magnet volume simultaneously. The iron pole-piece slotting technique is used and its design parameters are optimized to minimize the motor's force pulsation. To obtain optimal configuration using this technique, four design variables are selected and their approximate optimum values are determined by the Taguchi method using analysis of means (ANOM). In the next step, two more influential parameters are selected by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and their accurate optimum values are obtained by a trained ANN. Finite-element analysis (FEA) is used to appraise the performance of the motor in different experiments of the Taguchi method and for training the ANN. The results show that force pulsation of the optimized motor is greatly reduced while there is small drop in the motor thrust. © 2010 IEEE.

N2  - Machine learning algorithms known for their performance in using historical data and examples to predict and classify unknown instances. Decision tree is an efficient machine learning approach that can use data only without the involvement of decision maker to improve the decision making process. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)is another paradigm used for data classification. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy classification method based on MCDA called PROAFTN. To use PROAFTN, a set of parameters need to be established from data. The proposed approach uses data pre-processing and canonical genetic algorithm (GA) for obtaining these parameters from data. The generated models have been applied on popular data selected from several application domain, health, economy, etc. According to our experimental study, the new model performs significantly better than decision trees according in terms of accuracy and the interpretation of the decision rules.

N2  - Trustworthiness is a very critical element and should be treated as an important reference when customers try to select proper e-commerce systems. Trustworthiness evaluation requires the management of a wide variety of information types, parameters and uncertainties. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) has been regarded as a suitable set of methods to perform trustworthiness evaluations as a result of its flexibility and the possibility. For making trustworthiness measurement simple and standardized, this paper proposes a novel trustworthiness measurement model based on multi-criteria decision analysis. Recently, a lot of great efforts have been carried out to develop decision making for evaluation of trustworthiness and reputation. However, these research works still stay on the stage of theoretical research. This paper proposes and implements a trustworthiness measurement model using multi-criteria decision making approach for e-commerce systems. Firstly, this paper recognizes trust factors of e-commerce systems and distributes the factors in our designed multi-dimensional trust space and trust trustworthiness measurement model. All relevant factors are filtered, categorized and quantified. Then, our designed multi-criteria analysis mechanism can deal with the trust factors and analyze their trust features from different perspectives. Finally, the evaluated trustworthiness result is provided. Meanwhile, we also have a knowledge learning based approach to improve the accuracy of the result. At the end of this paper, we have conducted several experiments to validate our designed trustworthiness measurement by involving real world data. Our evaluated trustworthiness result and real world data are matched very well.

N2  - 'Neuro marketing' is a new disciplinary field in the marketing which try to understand the costumers' behavior by combining the marketing, psychology, neurology and economics. Behavior of the costumers are being inspected and analyzed in the perspective of neurological findings to assess the marketing strategies or products by using some specific techniques such as fMRI, EEG, FACS and etc. In this study, we have two goals. Firstly, it is aimed to determine the best suitable sector and product family for neuro marketing application by Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques. The criteria and sub criteria for neuro marketing applications are identified with the help of the related literature for finance, automotive, information technology and retail sectors. On the other hand, questionnaires are applied to make pairwise comparisons. According to the results of questionnaires, the selection of the proper sector and product family are made by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA). After than, a product family from the related sector is handled depending on the results of GRA. We focus on the neuro marketing application as the second goal. A system is constructed to analyze the emotions of customers by proper neuro marketing technique. FACS (Facial Action Coding System) analysis is applied to predict costumer gender profiles of selected product family. Results indicate that, FACS is an effective tool to predict costumer gender profiles. Relationship between costumer profiles and FACS results are inspected by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

N2  - This paper proposes a multi-criteria decision making method called the neutrosophic data analytic hierarchy process (NDAHP) for the single-valued neutrosophic set (SVNS). This method is an extension of the neutrosophic analytic hierarchy process (NAHP) designed to handle actual datasets which consist of crisp values. The proposed NDAHP method uses an objective weighting mechanism whereas all other existing versions of the AHP, fuzzy AHP, and other fuzzy based AHP method in literature such as the NAHP and picture fuzzy AHP uses a subjective weighting mechanism to arrive at the decision. This makes the proposed NDAHP method effective as the weightage of the criteria which forms the input of the evaluation matrix are determined in an objective manner using actual data collected for the problem, and hence will not change according to the opinions of different decision makers which are subjective. The proposed NDAHP method is applied to a multi-criteria decision making problem related to the ranking of the financial performance of five public listed petrochemical companies trading in the main board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). Actual dataset of 15 financial indices for the five petrochemical companies for 2017 obtained from Yahoo! Finance was used in this paper. Following this, a brief comparative study is conducted to evaluate the performance of our NDAHP algorithm against the results of other existing SVNS-based decision making methods in the literature. The results are compared against actual results obtained from KLSE. To further verify the rankings obtained through each method, the Spearman and Pearson ranking tests are carried out on each of the decision making methods that are studied. It is proved that NDAHP produces the most accurate results, and this was further verified from the results of the Spearman and Pearson ranking tests.

N2  - Multi-criteria decision making is one of the most critical and yet most challenging components in modern enterprise business intelligence. It is well known that complex business decisions are often made based on multi-dimensional criteria. The competitiveness of optimal business decision making typically resorts to finding a good trade-off among many different and possibly contradicting criteria, e.g., maximum profit, minimum price, minimum resource consumption. A skyline query operator is by design to find the set of interesting data points (objects) over a large dimensional data collection, satisfying a set of possibly contradicting conditions. In this paper, we provide an in-depth coverage of skyline computation models, algorithms and optimization techniques for improving both efficiency and quality of multi-criteria decision making. By reviewing and revising the state of art research in multi-criteria decision making using skyline operations, we describe the essential concepts, the alternative models, and the suite of techniques for providing scalable and elastic skyline computation in massively distributed computing environments. The paper consists of four parts. First, we provide an overview of skyline query operators in terms of concepts, basic processing algorithms and representative application scenarios. Second, we review the state of art literature in skyline query processing research and development, outline the most representative classes of skyline query processing and optimization techniques and discuss the pros and cons of existing approaches. Third, we provide a comprehensive analysis on the inherent limitations of some existing skyline models and algorithms and discuss why scaling skyline query processing over large high dimensional datasets continues to pose daunting challenges. Finally, we present optimization techniques for designing parallel skyline query processing algorithms and how to utilize GPUs to support and scale parallel skyline computations over high dimensional large datasets. We also introduce a novel dominance test technique, called GNL (GPU-based Nested Loop), which can drastically reduce the cost of dominance tests by leveraging GPUs, and outperform CPU-based dominance tests. © 2012 IEEE.

N2  - Cloud computing promises to increase innovation and the velocity with which applications are deployed all while helping any enterprise meet most IT service needs at a lower total cost of ownership and higher return investment. As the March of cloud continues, it brings both new opportunities and new security challenges. To take advantage of those opportunities while minimizing risks, we argue that Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) integrated in the cloud is one of the best existing solutions nowadays in the field. The concept of intrusion detection was known since past and was first proposed in 1980s. Since that time IDSs are evolving. However, even several efforts have been made in the area of Intrusion Detection Systems for cloud computing environment, many attacks still prevail. Therefore, the work presented in this paper proposes a multi-criteria analysis and a comparative study between several IDS architectures designed to work in cloud computing environments. To achieve this objective, in the first place we will search in the state of the art for several consistent IDS architectures designed to work in a cloud environment. Whereas, in a second step we will establish the criteria that will be useful for the evaluation of architectures. Later, using the approach of multi-criteria decision analysis MacBeth (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique) we will evaluate the criteria and assign to each one the appropriate weight according to their importance in the field of IDS architectures in cloud computing. The last step is to evaluate architectures against the criteria and collecting results of the model constructed in the previous steps.

N2  - This study considers the influence of organizational safety factors on the effective implementation of Safety Management Systems (SMS) in airlines in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The study design used a hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis method consisting of the Decision Making and Trial Laboratory (DEMATEL) and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) methods. The organizational factors used in the study provide the frameworks for implementation of Safety Management Systems. The source of information for the organizational factors was the International Civil Aviation Organization's Safety Management System Guidance Manual, which is also fully endorsed by the United Arab Emirates' General Civil Aviation Authority. The study targeted 35 aviation safety experts selected from air transport organizations in the United Arab Emirates. The DEMATEL-ANP method was used to measure experts' perception of the influence of organizational factors on the effective implementation of Safety Management Systems in the United Arab Emirates based on data collected through two rounds of surveys. The results revealed the kind and level of influence the organizational factors have on Safety Management System (SMS) implementation, and identified four core factors that are crucial for effective implementation of SMS in the UAE: hazard identification, risk management, change management, and coordination of emergency. The study concludes with a safety measurement model that is unique to the United Arab Emirates air transport industry.

N2  - Nowadays, coronavirus (COVID-19) is getting international attention due it considered as a life-threatened epidemic disease that hard to control the spread of infection around the world. Machine learning (ML) is one of intelligent technique that able to automatically predict the event with reasonable accuracy based on the experience and learning process. In the meantime, a rapid number of ML models have been proposed for predicate the cases of COVID-19. Thus, there is need for an evaluation and benchmarking of COVID-19 ML models which considered the main challenge of this study. Furthermore, there is no single study have addressed the problem of evaluation and benchmarking of COVID diagnosis models. However, this study proposed an intelligent methodology is to help the health organisations in the selection COVID-19 diagnosis system. The benchmarking and evaluation of diagnostic models for COVID-19 is not a trivial process. There are multiple criteria requires to evaluate and some of the criteria are conflicting with each other. Our study is formulated as a decision matrix (DM) that embedded mix of ten evaluation criteria and twelve diagnostic models for COVID-19. The multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method is employed to evaluate and benchmarking the different diagnostic models for COVID19 with respect to the evaluation criteria. An integrated MCDM method are proposed where TOPSIS applied for the benchmarking and ranking purpose while Entropy used to calculate the weights of criteria. The study results revealed that the benchmarking and selection problems associated with COVID19 diagnosis models can be effectively solved using the integration of Entropy and TOPSIS. The SVM (linear) classifier is selected as the best diagnosis model for COVID19 with the closeness coefficient value of 0.9899 for our case study data. Furthermore, the proposed methodology has solved the significant variance for each criterion in terms of ideal best and worst best value, beside issue when specific diagnosis models have same ideal best value.

N2  - Supplier assessment plays a critical role in the supply chain management, which involves the flow of goods and services from the initial stage (raw material procurement) to the final stage (delivery). Supplier assessment is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach that requires several criteria for the proper assessment of the suppliers. When there are several criteria involved, it makes the supplier assessment process more complicated. For a comprehensive and robust assessment process, we propose the use of supervised machine learning algorithms to classify various suppliers into four categories: excellent, good, satisfactory, and unsatisfactory. In this paper, supervised learning (classification) algorithms are applied for a supplier assessment problem where a model is trained based on the previous historical data and then tested on the new unseen data set. This method will provide an efficient way for supplier assessment that is more effective in terms of accuracy and time when compared to MCDM approach. Classification algorithms such as support vector machines (with linear, polynomial and radial basis kernels), logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and naïve Bayes methods are used to train the model and their performance is assessed against a test data. Finally, the performance measures from all the classification methods are used to assess the best supplier.

N2  - Actually, recommendation systems are widely used across the internet to assist users in finding products or services that fit their individual preferences. In this paper we present a new profile recommendation approach based on Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) algorithm. TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision analysis algorithm. Our approach can be used in the context of flatsharing between persons. The goal is to suggest to a new user profile a set of room-mates profiles that are similar to his. Our approach is proposed to improve the relation between room-mates. In our context, we suppose that we have a set of room-mates profiles saved in a database. Each profile is defined according to its weight in a quantitative multi-criteria. The principle consist to recommend profiles saved in the database according to their similarity with the user profile. In our case, the similarity between profiles is defined as a minimization and/or maximization of distance between multi-criteria. The novelty of our approach is to recommend for each new user profile a set of similar profiles according to a good compromise between the multi-criteria distance. Experiments demonstrate the potential of our approach under different scenarios.

N2  - This paper presents a modified technique of simulated annealing, based on machine learning for effective multi-objective design space exploration in High Level Synthesis (HLS). In this work, we present a more efficient simulated annealing called Fast Simulated Annealer (FSA) which is based on a decision tree machine learning algorithm. Our proposed exploration method makes use of a standard simulated annealer to generate a training set, and uses this set to implement a decision tree. Based on the outcome of the decision tree, the algorithm fixes the synthesis directives (pragmas) which contribute to minimizing/maximizing one of the cost function objectives and continues the annealing procedure using the decision tree. Experimental results show that the average execution time of our proposed tree based simulated annealing algorithm is on average 36% faster than the standard annealer and can be up to 48% faster, while leading to similar results. © 2014 European Electronic Chips & Systems design ECSI.

N2  - Knowledge about the future allocation of wind turbines is relevant for assessments of energy markets or necessary grid expansions. In Germany, political decisions drive the allocation together with investment decisions, social rejections, land use planning, regional development and ecological aspects. Taking all influences into account, a standardized multi-criteria optimization problem combining economic suitability, residential burden and site suitability calculates the regional distribution of wind turbines as input for further assessments. By considering the political framework as boundary conditions for the optimization and detailed geographic area suitability factors using a machine learning approach as input parameters, it is possible to assess effects of regulatory restrictions on regional developments. We use a backtesting for validation and weighting of the objectives. Sensitivities of changing regulatory frameworks modeled as different boundary conditions show effects of changing political decisions.

N2  - Decision Support System (DSS) is a support tool in helping users to provide suggestions of decisions when the information is disorganized and has a complex problem. Eventually, the dynamics of data on certain domains is unclear, semantic interoperability and heterogeneous data sources. To address solve the problem, the ontology can be applied to perform knowledge representation. The aim of this paper is to discuss the role of ontology in developing DSS as a supporter of multi-criteria decision-making. This study used Kitchenham's methodology to assist in literature review. There are five journals electronic databases selected as references, such as, Science Direct, IEEE, Google Scholar, JSTOR, and Springer Link This study obtained 21 final articles that were synthesized to answer research questions. The ontology-based DSS delivers a deeper analysis of the decision situation and suggests a new methodology which can affords accurate results of calculation. Though most of the studies present that the ontology is not integrated with DSS techniques.

N2  - Medical insurance fraud detection has become very significant and a demanding task. Fraudulent activities occurring in insurance claims has resulted a huge loss to the Health insurance companies. The goal of this proposed system is to collect and analyze insurance data including insurance claims, hospital records, past insurance claim data, patient's data and to provide a single platform for checking and providing a list of suspicious claims using predictive analytics. Predictive analytics helps to assess risk associated with certain conditions, and guides in decision making. The medical insurance dataset is viewed as a collection of data of hospitals, insurance company, doctors, patients, pharmacies, and other fields. These data can be huge with many doctors, hospitals and millions of patients details involved. In this work, a mediclaim fraud detection system is designed using predictive analytics, which detects fraudulent medical claims resulting from substantial monetary loss in healthcare systems. An analytical approach to detect medical claim insurance fraud is done using Logistic regression. The fraudulent claims are to be detected using the data from various sectors like insurance company, hospitals, pharmacy, and insurance policyholder. So a multi criteria decision support system is developed to predict if a claim is fraudulent or legitimate. The experimental results demonstrates that proposed model using logistic regression and multi criteria decision analysis performs better than the existing system.

N2  - In this paper we introduce the two-criterion optimization model to design multilayer perceptrons taking into account two objectives, which are the classification accuracy and computational complexity. Using this technique, it is possible to simplify the structure of neural network classifiers and at the same time to keep high classification accuracy. The main benefits of the approach proposed are related to the automatic choice of activation functions, the possibility of generating the ensemble of classifiers, and the embedded feature selection procedure. The cooperative multi-objective genetic algorithm is used as an optimizer to determine the Pareto set approximation in the two-criterion problem. The effectiveness of this approach is investigated on the speech-based emotion recognition problem. According to the results obtained, the usage of the proposed technique might lead to the generation of classifiers comprised by fewer neurons in the input and hidden layers, in contrast to conventional models, and to an increase in the emotion recognition accuracy by up to a 4.25% relative improvement due to the application of the ensemble of classifiers.

N2  - Indoor localisation has been a hot research topic because of its importance for location-based services. The proposed method takes affine transformation matrices and inertial information as input vectors to online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) and outputs relative translation between the two matching frames. The universal approximation capability and extreme learning speed of OS-ELM enable the proposed method to adapt to several matching steps and reduce the localisation error to a low scale. Fuzzy multi-objective decision making and corner detection are also used to improve the final result. Experimental results validate that the proposed method can provide a good localisation accuracy and improve the efficiency of localisation.

N2  - This research investigates the novel combination of multicriteria decision-making theories with a cognitive theory called human plausible reasoning (HPR) to provide personalized assistance via graphical user interfaces (GUIs). A GUI called intelligent file manipulator (IFM) helps with organizing computer file storage. The system reasons about user actions, goals, plans, and possible errors and offers automatic assistance in case of a problematic situation. Three multicriteria decision-making theories [simple additive weighting, multiattribute utility theory, and data envelopment analysis] were adapted, implemented, and combined with HPR, in turn. This process resulted in three different versions of IFM that were evaluated. The protocols of 30 users of different levels of expertise were provided to the system with each of the versions and to ten human experts. The responses of the experts and the different versions of the system were compared. The evaluation revealed that decision-making theories can increase control in an intelligent user interface. They can be combined with a cognitive theory like HPR. There was 66-81% compatibility of the different systems' responses to the proposals of the majority of experts. All decision-making theories were better in simulating the human experts' reasoning when there was unanimity of the human experts' opinion. In such cases, there was 68-84% compatibility of the different systems' responses to the experts' proposals. This research supports that HPR could successfully be completed by a multicriteria decision-making theory, and such combination can be effectively used for providing personalized help in GUIs.

N2  - Big data innovations and development brings opportunities to leverage the impacts of performance metrics on a strategic plan. The purpose of this research work is to study the selection of the performance metrics based on the preferences, and find out what metrics are prioritized in a current strategic plan and how to translate big data insights into meaningful managerial actions. The authors prioritized group commitments and commitment of KPIs in the case study of universities in Mongolia, using the AHP approach for multi-criteria decision makings. Hardcopy questionnaire and interview sessions were used for collecting data to analyse the prioritization results. Based on the prioritization results of strategies, we find that decision-makers strongly prefer strategies with the goals and this preference causes the imbalance of metrics on the dashboard. The prioritization of metrics is highly influenced by the data availability of management reporting. Prioritization of performance metrics are data-driven and bring bottom-up impacts on the dynamics of the strategic plan. The conflicted interests of stakeholders, internal policy, and the excessive amount of metrics make strategic decision makings difficult. The application of AHP in the case study contributes to improving the speed of decision-making processes, providing scientific results on KPIs prioritization and selection, and providing an approach to assess the differences between what strategic planners think and what they execute and prioritize on a practical level. The prioritization of performance metrics is the sustainable approach that can be extended to other strategic decision makings as well, for example prioritizing business model elements or business processes. This research work proves that the multi-criteria decision-making approach AHP can be used to prioritize and identify strategic focus based on selections of the performance metrics. The research also demonstrates the importance of combining bottom-up data-driven analytics with top-down strategy-making processes in big data developments.

N2  - With the increasing popularity of online shopping, customer's purchasing habits are gradually changing in that they often prefer to buy goods online instead of visiting a physical retail store. Hence, the business-to-customer (B2C) e-commerce concept has emerged to bring convenience and flexibility to customers. By shifting the traditional business model to e-commerce, the seller, e.g. supplier or retailer, not only concentrates on directly selling goods to customers online, but also needs to manage the whole business process, including product delivery to customers within a short period of time. To focus on the core business, the logistics function in the B2C market is usually outsourced to a logistics service provider (LSP). However, sellers who are new to the e-commerce market may find it difficult to select an appropriate LSP to fulfill their needs. In this paper, an enhanced logistics service provider selection (ELSPS) model is proposed for selecting an appropriate partner for providing delivery services under the e-commerce environment. A double fuzzy analytical hierarchy processing (FAHP) approach is applied for multi-criteria decision analysis in LSP selection and follow-up action prioritization. A pilot study is conducted, and the results provide a systematic approach and guidelines for new comers to enter into the e-commerce market.

N2  - In multi-criteria decision analysis problems, attributes are criteria with preference-ordered scales and the decision classes are also preference-ordered. Dominance-based rough set approach is an extension of classic rough set approach, which taking into account the ordering properties of criteria. Set-valued decision system is a generalized model of single-valued decision system. Knowledge from decision systems will vary with time under the dynamic decision-making environment. Incremental learning is an effective tool to deal with learning tasks since it can make full use of previous knowledge. In this paper, properties for dynamic maintenance of approximations are analyzed when the criteria values in the set-valued ordered decision system evolve with time. Then, algorithms for updating approximations incrementally with the variation of criteria values are discussed. Furthermore, experiments are carried out on several data sets to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.

N2  - The skyline operator has received considerable attention from the database community, due to its importance in many applications including multicriteria decision making, preference answering, and so forth. In many applications where uncertain data are inherently exist, i.e., data collected from different sources in distributed locations exhibit kind of uncertainty. Based on the well-known notation of the probabilistic skyline query over centralized uncertain data, the notation of distributed skyline queries over uncertain data were proposed. Then the problem of distributed skyline computation were studied and proposed an adaptive algorithm towards retrieving the global skyline tuples from all the distributed local sites with minimum communication cost. Finally, provide an extensive experimental evaluation showing the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. © 2013 IEEE.

Traditional methods for performance assessment cannot be applied to ROs successfully as they differ from business enterprises in their different nature, work content, specificity and multi-dimensionality of created products, spontaneity of activities, data time lag and other features. The paper presents the ROs productivity assessment scheme, which allows the evaluation of activities carried out in ROs from the perspective of their activity types. The created scheme is tested empirically using Multi-Criteria Decision Making analysis methods.

N2  - The Republic of Kazakhstan has significant deposits of fossil fuels and is one of the largest energy producers among the countries of Central Asia. At the same time, Kazakhstan is one of the richest countries of the world in terms of renewable resources, evaluated as 300 to 1000 billion kWh/year. The paper covers developed methodology and software tools for processing of resource-invariant heterogeneous data which could be applied for evaluation of different resources. This work applies the methods of evaluation of renewable energy sources potential that use multi-criteria decision making system (MCDM) based on, among others, Bayesian methods.

N2  - Industrial site selection is a strategic decision that involves several criteria with consideration for technical, economic, social, environmental, and political issues. These criteria are generally described using a number of different indicators, expressed in quantitative and qualitative ways with some possible uncertainty. Decision making requires, therefore, appropriate tools to enable data collection, storage, analysis, fusion, and knowledge management to address this complex multifaceted scenario. This paper presents a comprehensive method for industrial site selection, an innovative approach for reasoning uncertainty and efficiently finding the most suitable solution based on a set of interacting decision support systems. Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides accurate results in the region of interest, coinciding with the choices of expert analysts.
