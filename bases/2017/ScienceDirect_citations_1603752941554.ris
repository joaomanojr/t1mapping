AB  - Supplier assessment and selection mapping as an essential component of supply chain management are usually multi-criteria decision-making problems. Decision making is the thought process of selecting a logical choice from the available options. This is generally made under fuzzy environment. Fuzzy decision-making is a decision process using the sets whose boundaries are not sharply defined. The aim of this paper is to show how fuzzy set theory, fuzzy decision-making and hybrid solutions based on fuzzy can be used in the various models for supplier assessment and selection in a 50 year period.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) has been considered as one of the deadliest human diseases worldwide and the accurate prediction of HF risks would be vital for HF prevention and treatment. To predict HF risks, decision support systems based on artificial neural networks (ANN) have been widely proposed in previous studies. Generally, these existing ANN-based systems usually assumed that HF attributes have equal risk contribution to the HF diagnosis. However, several previous investigations have shown that the risk contributions of the attributes would be different. Thus the equal risk assumption concept associated with existing ANN methods would not properly reflect the diagnosis status of HF patients. In this study, the commonly used 13 HF attributes were considered and their contributions were determined by an experienced cardiac clinician. And Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (Fuzzy_AHP) technique was used to compute the global weights for the attributes based on their individual contribution. Then the global weights that represent the contributions of the attributes were applied to train an ANN classifier for the prediction of HF risks in patients. The performance of the newly proposed decision support system based on the integration of ANN and Fuzzy_AHP methods was evaluated by using online clinical dataset of 297 HF patients and compared with that of the conventional ANN method. Our result shows that the proposed method could achieve an average prediction accuracy of 91.10%, which is 4.40% higher in comparison to that of the conventional ANN method. In addition, the newly proposed method also had better performance than seven previous methods that reported prediction accuracies in the range of 57.85–89.01%. The improvement of the HF risk prediction in the current study might be due to both the various contributions of the HF attributes and the proposed hybrid method. These findings suggest that the proposed method could be used to accurately predict HF risks in the clinic.

AB  - The screening of novel materials with good performance and the modelling of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs), among other issues, are hot topics in the field of materials science. Traditional experiments and computational modelling often consume tremendous time and resources and are limited by their experimental conditions and theoretical foundations. Thus, it is imperative to develop a new method of accelerating the discovery and design process for novel materials. Recently, materials discovery and design using machine learning have been receiving increasing attention and have achieved great improvements in both time efficiency and prediction accuracy. In this review, we first outline the typical mode of and basic procedures for applying machine learning in materials science, and we classify and compare the main algorithms. Then, the current research status is reviewed with regard to applications of machine learning in material property prediction, in new materials discovery and for other purposes. Finally, we discuss problems related to machine learning in materials science, propose possible solutions, and forecast potential directions of future research. By directly combining computational studies with experiments, we hope to provide insight into the parameters that affect the properties of materials, thereby enabling more efficient and target-oriented research on materials discovery and design.

AB  - Airlines typically carry out freight transportation in a hub and spoke structure, where the movements between the outstations and the hub are served by trucks. To transport freight efficiently, air carriers must consider bundling options for shipments that are delivered at outstations and have to be moved to the hub. There are three options when it comes to bundling freight: on ‘through unit load devices’ (T-ULD) (all freight for the same flight at the hub), on ‘mixed unit load devices’ (M-ULD) (freight for different flights at the hub) and loose freight in trucks. The optimal freight bundling configuration for carriers, taking into account their main KPIs (key performance indicators), is unknown. This research formulates the problem as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, allowing carriers to decide which configuration is optimal for a given outstation. The selected KPIs (cost, (un)loading time, and quality) are formulated as mathematical functions. A new MCDM, called best worst method (BWM), is then used to identify the best configuration with respect to the three KPIs. The proposed methodology is applied to KLM Cargo to identify the best configuration for the selected outstations that supply freight to the KLM hub at Schiphol Airport. This case study shows that there are different optimal freight bundling configurations for different outstations and that trucking costs and freight handling tariffs are among the key factors in deciding which configuration is optimal.

AB  - The literature on supply base segmentation has increasingly adopted multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques into recently proposed models. However, most proposals segment the supply base from the standpoint of the purchased item, which prevents them from providing guidelines that are specific to each supplier. Some authors have attempted to overcome these limitations by putting forward portfolio models based on the relationship with suppliers. These approaches use fuzzy variables and MCDM methods that take qualitative judgements by experts as the only input for decision making. However, many companies have databases with historical data about the performance of past transactions with suppliers that should be considered by expert systems that aim to comprehensively evaluate suppliers’ performance. This paper seeks to address this gap by proposing a segmentation model based on the relationship with suppliers capable of aggregating quantitative and qualitative criteria. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to determine the relative importance of each criteria. Fuzzy 2-tuple, a prominent computing with word (CWW) approach, was used to evaluate suppliers with a mixture of historical quantitative data and qualitative judgements by purchasing experts. An illustrative application of the proposed model was carried out in the pharmaceutical supply center (PSC) of a teaching hospital. The proposed model can be viewed as a decision support system capable of aggregating the qualitative judgements of experts and quantitative historical performance measures, thus providing guidelines to improve the relationship between suppliers and the buyer firm.

AB  - Modeling of groundwater potentiality zones is a vital scheme for effective management of groundwater resources. This study developed a new multi-criteria decision making algorithm for groundwater potentiality modeling through modifying the standard GOD model. The developed model christened as GODT model was applied to assess groundwater potential in a multi-faceted crystalline geologic terrain, southwestern, Nigeria using the derived four unify groundwater potential conditioning factors namely: Groundwater hydraulic confinement (G), aquifer Overlying strata resistivity (O), Depth to water table (D) and Thickness of aquifer (T) from the interpreted geophysical data acquired in the area. With the developed model algorithm, the GIS-based produced G, O, D and T maps were synthesized to estimate groundwater potential index (GWPI) values for the area. The estimated GWPI values were processed in GIS environment to produce groundwater potential prediction index (GPPI) map which demarcate the area into four potential zones. The produced GODT model-based GPPI map was validated through application of both correlation technique and spatial attribute comparative scheme (SACS). The performance of the GODT model was compared with that of the standard analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model. The correlation technique results established 89% regression coefficients for the GODT modeling algorithm compared with 84% for the AHP model. On the other hand, the SACS validation results for the GODT and AHP models are 72.5% and 65%, respectively. The overall results indicate that both models have good capability for predicting groundwater potential zones with the GIS-based GODT model as a good alternative. The GPPI maps produced in this study can form part of decision making model for environmental planning and groundwater management in the area.

Such indices can be dependent on tectonics, erosional processes and other factors that control the morphology of the landforms. The inter-relationships between geomorphic indices can determine the influence of regional tectonic activity in the shape development of drainage basins. A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) procedure has been used to perform an integrated cluster analysis that highlights information associated with the dominant regional tectonic activity. Factor Analysis (FA) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) were considered within that procedure, producing a representation of the distributed regional tectonic activity of the drainage basins studied. The study area is western Crete, located in the outer fore-arc of the Hellenic subduction zone, one of the world's most tectonically active regions. The results indicate that in the landscape evolution of the study area (especially the western basins) tectonic controls dominate over lithological controls.

AB  - Developments in carbon fiber mechanical properties are directly dependent on its manufacturing process, especially the thermal process of carbonization through a High Temperature (HT) furnace. These mechanical properties cannot be straightforwardly predicted experimentally since the thermal process involves complex parameters such as: (i) zones temperature, (ii) applied fiber tension, (iii) the N2 gas flow rate which is influenced by uncertain disturbances. The aim of this paper is to optimize the carbon fiber modulus based on the given range of tensile strength using a predictive modelling technique. The data collection of the carbonization thermal process is significantly costly and time consuming, hence we used a novel DOE method to minimize the number of required experiments. The carbon fiber with the highest and lowest tensile and modulus properties were initially analyzed by X-ray diffraction and Raman Spectroscopy, but no significant differences were observed that could account for the differences in measured mechanical and physical properties, thus a surrogate modelling approach was adopted. Four different mathematical methods were employed for modelling and compared with one another. These are (i) non-linear multivariable regression, (ii) Levenberg-Marquardt neural network algorithm, (iii) thin plate splines, and (iv) a convex hull technique. The results clearly showed that the convex hull technique has less error compared to the other tested methods. This method was selected to optimize the carbon fiber modulus based on the given range of tensile strength. Using the convex hull technique along with an evolutionary search (Genetic Algorithm) method, it is shown that the modulus of carbon fiber can be optimized for any given range of tensile strength, providing an optimum set of control parameters are chosen during the process.

AB  - The decommissioning process is constantly challenged with indeterminate risks associated with deteriorated structures and the practice of late-life decommissioning planning. The issue is further complicated by the absence of a fit-for-purpose decision framework. This work develops a knowledge based advisory expert system to address the late-life structural ambiguity of fixed jacket platforms in the selection of a best practicable decommissioning method. A review on the decommissioning industry and its growing need for data-driven management are presented. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is utilized to solve the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem of choosing the best practicable decommissioning alternative. The effects and ranking of identified key structural-operation factors on the decommissioning planning process are numerically computed and discussed. The key system variables are developed with reference to established Asset Integrity Management Systems. Subject matter expert surveys are conducted on leading decommissioning and structural integrity experts in the region which are reflected in the decision matrices. A mathematical standardization technique is employed to remove inconsistencies in the intermediate decision vectors. The model is benchmarked against an actual decommissioning project in Malaysian waters which was based on conventional practices. A comprehensive framework is proposed to establish a practical working philosophy for the developed algorithm.

AB  - Predictive modeling in medicine involves the development of computational models which are capable of analysing large amounts of data in order to predict healthcare outcomes for individual patients. Computational intelligence approaches are suitable when the data to be modelled are too complex for conventional statistical techniques to process quickly and efficiently. These advanced approaches are based on mathematical models that have been especially developed for dealing with the uncertainty and imprecision which is typically found in clinical and biological datasets. This paper provides a survey of recent work on computational intelligence approaches that have been applied to prostate cancer predictive modeling, and considers the challenges which need to be addressed. In particular, the paper considers a broad definition of computational intelligence which includes metaheuristic optimisation algorithms (also known as nature inspired algorithms), Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Fuzzy based approaches, and hybrids of these, as well as Bayesian based approaches, and Markov models. Metaheuristic optimisation approaches, such as the Ant Colony Optimisation, Particle Swarm Optimisation, and Artificial Immune Network have been utilised for optimising the performance of prostate cancer predictive models, and the suitability of these approaches are discussed.

The exemplary preference information in the form of pair-wise comparisons of alternatives constitutes the training information. More specifically, given the exemplary pairwise choices of a DM, we present an approach to infer the unique preference model of the DM, in terms of the parameter values of GACI operator.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to present a practical solution to a particular real-life problem of discrete flow control in a manufacturing system. For this purpose a fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method, which is an extension of the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) approach using Ordered Fuzzy Numbers (OFNs), is used. The paper includes a case study of the application of this method as a flow controller for the transport trolley in a flexible manufacturing system. The immediate aim of control is to choose the transport trolley’s destination (production line). A set of criteria (parameters) for the evaluation of the flow’s destination is suggested, related to time efficiency and equal workload of machines. The advantage of the proposed method is its ability to distinguish the type of criteria (benefit, cost) by using the orientation of ordered fuzzy numbers. An example of calculations using the presented method is shown and the results of the method, based on the simulation of a manufacturing system, are presented. The results thus obtained are compatible with flexible automation. In order to test the FTOPSIS method with OFNs the proposed flow control method is compared with the TOPSIS method and other simple control methods (dispatching rules). The proposed method is more efficient than the methods used for comparison and can be effective and efficient for diversified production and fast, automatic changeovers on production lines.

AB  - Objective
Manual evaluation of machine learning algorithms and selection of a suitable classifier from the list of available candidate classifiers, is highly time consuming and challenging task. If the selection is not carefully and accurately done, the resulting classification model will not be able to produce the expected performance results. In this study, we present an accurate multi-criteria decision making methodology (AMD) which empirically evaluates and ranks classifiers’ and allow end users or experts to choose the top ranked classifier for their applications to learn and build classification models for them.
Methods and material
Existing classifiers performance analysis and recommendation methodologies lack (a) appropriate method for suitable evaluation criteria selection, (b) relative consistent weighting mechanism, (c) fitness assessment of the classifiers’ performances, and (d) satisfaction of various constraints during the analysis process. To assist machine learning practitioners in the selection of suitable classifier(s), AMD methodology is proposed that presents an expert group-based criteria selection method, relative consistent weighting scheme, a new ranking method, called optimum performance ranking criteria, based on multiple evaluation metrics, statistical significance and fitness assessment functions, and implicit and explicit constraints satisfaction at the time of analysis. For ranking the classifiers performance, the proposed ranking method integrates Wgt.Avg.F-score, CPUTimeTesting, CPUTimeTraining, and Consistency measures using the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The final relative closeness score produced by TOPSIS, is ranked and the practitioners select the best performance (top-ranked) classifier for their problems in-hand.
Findings
Based on the extensive experiments performed on 15 publically available UCI and OpenML datasets using 35 classification algorithms from heterogeneous families of classifiers, an average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.98 is observed. Similarly, the AMD method has showed improved performance of 0.98 average Spearman's rank correlation coefficient as compared to 0.83 and 0.045 correlation coefficient of the state-of-the-art ranking methods, performance of algorithms (PAlg) and adjusted ratio of ratio (ARR).
Conclusion and implication
The evaluation, empirical analysis of results and comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the feasibility of AMD methodology, especially the selection and weighting of right evaluation criteria, accurate ranking and selection of optimum performance classifier(s) for the user's application's data in hand. AMD reduces expert's time and efforts and improves system performance by designing suitable classifier recommended by AMD methodology.

AB  - The demand for the energy has increased drastically as a result of the rapid growth in industrialization, urbanisation and higher standard of living. One such potential substitute to fossil fuels is biodiesel that ensures sustainable energy source. The selection of appropriate source of biodiesel and proper blending of biodiesel plays a major role in alternate energy production. In the present work, a novel hybrid Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique was proposed to evaluate and select the optimum fuel biodiesel blend for the IC engine with conflicting criteria to enhance the energy efficiency. Exploratory analysis were carried out on a single cylinder four stroke, air cooled, constant speed, direct injection diesel engine with a rated output of 4.4 kW at 1500 rpm at different loads. Two hybrid MCDM models, namely Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy VIKOR were proposed. Fuzzy was applied to determine the relative weights of the evaluation criteria whereas TOPSIS and VIKOR were applied to obtain the final ranking of alternatives. Diesel, B20, B40, B60, B80 and B100 fuel blend alternatives are prepared by varying the proportion of biodiesel for MCDM model. Similarly BTE, MRPR, NOx, CO2, CO, HC, SMOKE, ID, CD and Exhaust gas temperature were considered as the evaluation criteria. The ranking order by Fuzzy TOPSIS is based on closeness coefficient and Fuzzy VIKOR is based on VIKOR index. In Fuzzy TOPSIS, B40 stands first at 50% and 75% load conditions and second at 25% and full load conditions respectively. In Fuzzy VIKOR, B40 stands first at 25% and 50% conditions and second at no load, 75% and full load conditions respectively. The ranking of alternatives as obtained by both Fuzzy-TOPSIS and Fuzzy-VIKOR is B40 > B20 > Diesel > B80 > B60 > B100 and B40 > B20 > Diesel > B60 > B80 > B100. From the results, it was observed that both the methods indicated that B40 is the best blend to operate the engine. Hence, it is concluded that mixing 40% biodiesel with diesel is suggested as a good partial replacement for diesel. This paper highlights a new insight into MCDM techniques to evaluate the best fuel blend for the decision makers such as engine manufactures and R& D engineers to meet the fuel economy and emission norms to empower the green revolution and energy management.

AB  - In this paper we deal with the problem of designing a classifier able to learn the classification of existing units in inventory and then use it to classify new units according to their attributes in a multi-criteria ABC inventory classification environment. To solve this problem we design a multi-start constructive algorithm to train a discrete artificial neural network using a randomized greedy strategy to add neurons to the network hidden layer. The process of weights’ searching for the neurons to be added is based on solving linear programming formulations. The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm is much more efficient when the dual formulations are used to find the weights of the network neurons and that the obtained classifier has good levels of generalization accuracy. In addition, the proposed algorithm can be straight applied to other multi-class classification problems with more than three classes.

AB  - Small hydropower stations in remote areas promote regional economic development and social progress. Social sustainability assessment which immensely decides the success of small hydropower development has been paid little attention currently. Meanwhile, present methods tend to fail the social sustainability assessment due to following three problems. Firstly, the uncertainty of information cannot be fully described. Secondly, the correlation among indicators lacks rationality. Thirdly, the ranking methods adopted in previous studies are not appropriate for social sustainability assessment of small hydropower. To deal with the above problems, a Preference Ranking Organization. Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) outranking method using hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) is proposed. Firstly, the HFLTS is introduced to describe the uncertainty of information. Then, the Analytical Network Process (ANP) method is adopted to measure the correlation between indicators. Moreover, the PROMETHEE method is employed to rank the social sustainability of each alternative. Then an empirical study is carried out to prove that the proposed methodology is effective and practical. Finally, public recognition is discovered as the key indicator by comparative analysis and discussion. This study provides an innovative perspective for the social sustainability assessment of small hydropower and contributes to making more rational and scientific decisions.

AB  - Within unmanned aerial vehicles on-going research topics, automatic target recognition is acquiring relevance. This is due to the easiness with which it is possible to acquire such devices. In order to do this, signal processing and classification techniques could be adopted. Also, in order to improve the classification ratio, optimization techniques could be used. This subject is object of study for many researchers, but the authors worry about the lack of information while using single-objective optimization techniques. The proposed work comprises the application of multi-objective optimization design in order to create an automatic target recognition system to discriminate different types of unmanned aerial vehicles. In order to accomplish this, a K-band radar system is used to send and receive electromagnetic signals, which are then processed with feature extraction techniques, and finally, applied on an artificial neural network system. In order to improve the system’s classification ratio, the classifier is defined as a multi-objective problem, and evolutionary multi-objective optimization techniques are applied. Finally, in order to select the best possible trade-off, the level diagrams multi-criteria decision making methodology is used to compare different solutions.

AB  - Rural transportation management plays a critical role in the sustainable future of human society. Two emerging challenges faced by rural communities today are cost control and equity due to the increasing demand and limited operations resources available and the need to deal with the inevitable tradeoffs among multiple objectives and criteria. In this paper, we develop a new methodology for rural transportation management which takes into consideration of both the equity and cost factors under multiple objectives. We conceptualize and define equity in rural transportation management with the development of new performance measures and an analytical model for decision making with multiple desirable and undesirable objectives. We also develop a heuristic procedure based on data envelopment analysis for characterizing and analyzing the route design choices on the frontier between costs and multi-objective measures of equity. A GIS-based decision support system is constructed to process the extensive data required in our analysis. The new methodology has been successfully implemented by Quinte Access, a not-for-profit organization in a rural community in Ontario, to help redesign bus routes with significant quantitative benefits observed in multiple performance dimensions. It is also expected that the new knowledge, insights, and decision support tools developed through this study for transportation planning, big data management, and transportation service operations can be transferred to other rural communities in order to deliver more sustainable transportation services in rural regions around the world.

AB  - Time series forecasting is important in several applied domains because it facilitates decision-making in this domains. Commonly, statistical methods such as regression analysis and Markov chains, or artificial intelligent methods such as artificial neural networks (ANN) are used in forecasting tasks. In this paper different time series forecasting methods were compared using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series forecasting. NDVI is a nonlinear, non-stationary and seasonal time series used for short-term vegetation forecasting and management of various problems, such as prediction of spread of forest fire and forest disease. In order to reduce input data set dimensionality and improve predictability, stepwise regression analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were used as data pre-processing techniques. For comparing the obtained performance for the different methods, several performance criteria commonly used in forecasting statistical evaluation were calculated.

AB  - Optimization design has been widely used in the aerodynamic design process of scramjets. The single expansion ramp nozzle is an important component for scramjets to produces most of thrust force. A new concept of increasing the aerodynamics of the scramjet nozzle with energy deposition is presented. The essence of the method is to create a heated region in the inner flow field of the scramjet nozzle. In the current study, the two-dimensional coupled implicit compressible Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes and Menter's shear stress transport turbulence model have been applied to numerically simulate the flow fields of the single expansion ramp nozzle with and without energy deposition. The numerical results show that the proposal of energy deposition can be an effective method to increase force characteristics of the scramjet nozzle, the thrust coefficient CT increase by 6.94% and lift coefficient CN decrease by 26.89%. Further, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm coupled with the Radial Basis Function neural network surrogate model has been employed to determine optimum location and density of the energy deposition. The thrust coefficient CT and lift coefficient CN are selected as objective functions, and the sampling points are obtained numerically by using a Latin hypercube design method. The optimized thrust coefficient CT further increase by 1.94%, meanwhile, the optimized lift coefficient CN further decrease by 15.02% respectively. At the same time, the optimized performances are in good and reasonable agreement with the numerical predictions. The findings suggest that scramjet nozzle design and performance can benefit from the application of energy deposition.

AB  - Wine quality is a complex attribute, thus single berry parameters are not adequate to define grape suitability for the production of specific wines. Fuzzy logic systems are particularly suited for aggregating multiple data to feed multi-variables decision support systems. The aim of the present study was the development of a simple in use and reliable tool based on fuzzy logic multi criteria decision making to objectively classify wine quality based on selected grape attributes. For this purpose, representative berry samples were harvested and vinified for two consecutive years from thirteen commercial vineyards in Nemea, Greece planted with Vitis vinifera cv. Agiorgitiko. Total soluble solids, pH, berry volume, botrytis infection, grape seed colorization, anthocyanin extractability, optical density (OD 520) and skin phenolics (Dpell) were measured at harvest and were used in the tool as inputs. Moreover, the produced wines were sensory evaluated by an experienced and trained panel. The ranking of the vineyards, according to the tasting panel, was compared to the ranking made by the tool and the results showed high general agreement between them suggesting that the latter was able to model expert knowledge successfully. According to the results, the fuzzy logic multi criteria decision making tool could allow the incorporation of grape quality parameters at harvest into a single index providing grape growers and wine producers with a valuable tool for classifying wine quality.

AB  - Aim of this research is to deliver a system of procedures and instruments that allows comparing different scenarios of restoration and retrofit of existing buildings applicable each time a relevant decision about the asset has to be made. The system developed takes advantages of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), thus to focus on main clients’ needs. Decisions about real estate assets are frequently made by managers with incomplete and scattered data, not sufficient to fully support the decision making process. Using a BIM model as a central repository of information could strongly support to compare objectively different scenarios and consequently to decide the application of a multi-criteria matrix involving management, energy, economic and social issues. BIM and BEM (Building Energy Modelling) techniques have a wide potential and analysis capabilities; however, they are often adopted without an integrated framework, causing missing performances and costs overrun. The result is a system enabling to analyze the asset, to produce BIM and BEM models ready to include life cycle data, to evaluate feasible alternatives and scenarios and to extract relevant performance indicators for decision makers’ support. An existing office building in Milan representing an awkward field for intervention is the case study for the system application. While the tools and software adopted are commonly used, the system of procedures developed by the authors can be considered as an ensemble of workflows otherwise typically used independently. Using them together enhance the decision process providing data on which to set up a strategic plan of the refurbishment considering costs, continuity in occupancy and energy efficiency.

AB  - Currently, the implementation of a new production system needs to satisfy three dimensions of sustainability, i.e., it must be economically viable, socially beneficial and have a low environmental impact. Unfortunately, for the social aspect, there is a lack of theoretical underpinnings, in contrast to the environmental dimension, for which the theoretical underpinnings were studied twenty years ago. Indeed, there is not a clear common frame for the social dimension, probably due to the complexity and diversity of social issues. Furthermore, some indicators are difficult to assess because of their qualitative and subjective nature. The availability of input data to evaluate social indicators is often another major bottleneck. However, when considering a new industrial activity, perhaps the most important key indicator in the social assessment is the accrued employment generated. Indeed, the implementation of new industrial activity has the potential to promote the local economy and regional development, especially in rural areas. For authorities and the public, accrued employment is pivotal to facilitate acceptability and to ensure regional sustainability. In this article, the authors propose a method to estimate the total number of jobs created by the development of a new activity. The classic classification of direct, indirect and induced jobs is used. The new methods are based on economic data and, more precisely, on the added value and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization to create a correlation to estimate manpower. Different mathematical methods are used to determine the values of the correlation parameters. After comparing the different approaches, this article presents the capabilities of this evaluation and its interest for multi-criteria analysis based on a case study of the optimal design of a bioethanol supply chain in France.

AB  - The cost-optimal analysis provides the most cost-effective energy retrofit solutions. This can strongly support the deep renovation of buildings. However, an outstanding question arises: How to achieve the robust assessment of cost-optimal solutions, feasible for any building? The paper answers this question by proposing a new multi-stage framework for cost-optimal analysis by multi-objective optimisation and artificial neural networks, called CASA. It couples EnergyPlus and MATLAB®. A genetic algorithm allows to select recommended retrofit packages by minimizing energy consumption and thermal discomfort. Among these packages, the cost-optimal solution is identified. It is robust because the algorithm explores a wide domain of retrofit scenarios. The optimization procedure uses artificial neural networks to predict building performance. Large-scale uncertainty and sensitivity analyses are conducted to support the generation of the networks. These latter are tested against data provided by current literature with excellent results. The networks’ applicability to whole building categories and rapidity of evaluation make the procedure feasible for any building. For demonstration, CASA is applied to a reference office building located in South Italy, by investigating the related category. The achieved cost-optimal solution produces global cost savings around 42.4€/m2, and significant reductions of energy consumption, discomfort hours and polluting emissions.

AB  - Environmental management, being an important component in strategies for achieving sustainable development of processes and products, has emerged as a proactive approach in majority of the manufacturing organizations. From the strategic perspective environmentally conscious manufacturing (ECM) programs lead to better environmental management practice. The objective of the current paper is to present an integrated and holistic framework to evaluate ECM programs. This framework combines three multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods to consider eight major environmentally conscious manufacturing indicators (ECMI) in order to identify the efficiency of each ECM program. First the interdependence relationship among the ECMIs is established using decision-making trail and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). Then a range of weightage (i.e. upper and lower bounds) is created for each ECMI using analytic network process (ANP) to include managerial preferences. Finally, this range of weightage for each indicator is applied to perform restricted multiplier data envelopment analysis (RMDEA). Results show that the technical efficiency of the inefficient ECM programs for integrated RMDEA, on average, is calculated as 53.2% whereas traditional input oriented DEA provides the same score as 72.3%. This clearly indicates that integrated RMDEA is better than the input oriented DEA because same level of output could be produced with lesser resources if the ECM programs perform on the frontier. Hence, the advantage of this methodology is that the managerial preferences are successfully implemented through this newly developed hybrid methodology that will help to reduce less resource consumption and lead to better environmental policy.

AB  - Commuting reflects the long-term travel behavior of people and significantly impacts urban traffic congestion and emission. Recent advances in data availability provide new opportunities to understand commuting patterns efficiently and effectively. This study develops a series of data mining methods to identify the spatiotemporal commuting patterns of Beijing public transit riders. Using one-month transit smart card data, we measure spatiotemporal regularity of individual commuters, including residence, workplace, and departure time. This data could be used to identify transit commuters by leveraging spatial clustering and multi-criteria decision analysis approaches. A disaggregated-level survey is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods with a commuter identification accuracy that reaches as high as 94.1%. By visualizing the spatial distribution of the homes and workplaces of transit commuters, we determine a clear disparity between commuters and noncommuters and confirm the existence of job–house imbalance in Beijing. The findings provide useful insights for policymakers to shape a more balanced job–housing relationship by adjusting the monocentric urban structure of Beijing. In addition, the extracted individual-level commuting patterns can be used as valuable information for public transit network design and optimization. These strategies are expected to reduce car dependency, shorten excess commute, and alleviate traffic congestion.

To achieve more sustainable and more intelligent constructions, the construction industry needs decision support systems that integrate a selection of processes, constraints, time span, and performance criteria that are relevant to all involved stakeholders. This paper intends to demonstrate a design methodology that solves these challenges, and provides several frameworks for decision support systems deemed relevant to the construction industry. Examples of current applications are provided, together with a discussion on future opportunities. The possible synergy with new technologies is emphasized.

AB  - A new integrated and generic Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) is presented based on a combination of Artificial Intelligence and Multicriteria Decision Analysis techniques. The approach proposed is developed to address commonly faced spatial decision problems of site selection, site ranking, impact assessment and spatial knowledge discovery under one system. The site selection module utilises a theme-based Analytical Hierarchy Process. Two novel site ranking techniques are introduced. The first is based on a systematic neighbourhood comparison of sites with respect to key datasets (criterions). The second utilises multivariate ordering capability of one-dimensional Self-Organizing Maps. The site impact assessment module utilises a new spatially enabled Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix. A spatial variant of General Regression Neural Networks is developed for Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and prediction analysis. The developed system is proposed as a useful modern tool that facilitates quantitative and evidence based decision making in multicriteria decision environment. The intended users of the system are decision makers in government organisations, in particular those involved in planning and development when taking into account socio-economic, environmental and public health related issues.

AB  - This paper presents two novel interval-valued fuzzy soft set approaches. First, we initiate a new axiomatic definition of interval-valued fuzzy distance measure, which is expressed by interval-valued fuzzy number (IVFN) that will reduce the information loss and remain more original information. Then, the objective weights of various parameters are determined via normal distribution. Combining objective weights with subjective weights, we present the combined weights, which can reflect both the subjective considerations of the decision maker and the objective information. Later, we propose two algorithms to solve stochastic multi-criteria decision making problem, which take regret aversion and prospect preference of decision makers into consideration in the decision process. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of two approaches are demonstrated by two numerical examples.

AB  - Decisions for aging-dam management requires a transparent process to prevent the dam failure, thus to avoid severe consequences in socio-economic and environmental terms. Multiple criteria analysis arose to model complex problems like this. This paper reviews specific problems, applications and Multi-Criteria Decision Making techniques for dam management. Multi-Attribute Decision Making techniques had a major presence under the single approach, specially the Analytic Hierarchy Process, and its combination with Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution was prominent under the hybrid approach; while a high variety of complementary techniques was identified. A growing hybridization and fuzzification are the two most relevant trends observed. The integration of stakeholders within the decision making process and the inclusion of trade-offs and interactions between components within the evaluation model must receive a deeper exploration. Despite the progressive consolidation of Multi-Criteria Decision Making in dam management, further research is required to differentiate between rational and intuitive decision processes. Additionally, the need to address benefits, opportunities, costs and risks related to repair, upgrading or removal measures in aging dams suggests the Analytic Network Process, not yet explored under this approach, as an interesting path worth investigating.

AB  - A Meta-cognitive Quaternion Valued Neural Network (Mc-QVNN) learning algorithm and its forecasting applications is proposed in this paper. The Mc-QVNN has two parts, the cognitive part that contains the QVNN and a meta-cognitive part, which self-regulates the learning algorithm. At each epoch, when the Mc-QVNN receives a new sample, the meta-cognitive part makes a decision about the manner, the time and the need to learn this sample or not. In this case, the algorithm deletes the unneeded samples and keeps just the necessary ones for learning. The meta-cognitive component makes the decision according to the quaternion magnitude and phases. Three forecasting problems, which are Mackey–Glass time series, Lorenz attractor and the real home's power in the city of Honolulu in Hawaii, USA, are taken to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. Comparison with other existing methods shows that the Mc-QVNN is promising for forecasting chaotic systems.

The system is dialog-based and uses a Multi-Criteria Decision Making technique that is a hybrid of Analytic Hierarchy Process and Sensitive Simple Additive Weighting. The paper describes an approach for disease modeling that uses a set of characteristics which are weighted for each disease using two types of weights: Relative Weights and Scales. The diagnostic process involves calculating the utility value for each disease based on the utility values of its characteristics. Experimental results show an accuracy of over 95%. The system implemented is called AgriDiagnose and it consists of a web-based pathology tool to model the diseases and a mobile app for farmers to interact with the system for disease diagnosis in the field.

AB  - Complexities in the decision-making process are a major problem in business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce due to the fact that an organisation may involve several individuals with different backgrounds and incentives in the buying process, resulting in inconsistency when making decisions. In this paper, a novel buying decision-making process, using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP-NN) with a library-publishers scenario as a case study is proposed to address the challenge of inconsistency in buyers’ opinions. The AHP uses library books criteria and assigns a weight to each, using a pairwise comparison matrix with an arrangement based on priority. Consistency in judgement levels was measured using congruence and dissonance. The MLP-NN was used to develop specific non-linear mapping by adjusting network weights using a learning algorithm. The weights were used to adjust coefficients using the least-squared error and gradient descent method to increase the consistency of buyers’ opinions and consequently improve the choice of indexes that conformed to the common agreement of the buyers. The results show that the intensity of the process, in terms of number of alternatives and criteria, is dependent on both decision-making and knowledge acquisition.

AB  - Lexicographic preferences on a set of attributes provide a cognitively plausible structure for modeling the behavior of human decision makers. Therefore, the induction of corresponding models from revealed preferences or observed decisions constitutes an interesting problem from a machine learning point of view. In this paper, we introduce a learning algorithm for inducing generalized lexicographic preference models from a given set of training data, which consists of pairwise comparisons between objects. Our approach generalizes simple lexicographic orders in the sense of allowing the model to consider several attributes simultaneously (instead of looking at them one by one), thereby significantly increasing the expressiveness of the model class. In order to evaluate our method, we present a case study of a highly complex real-world problem, namely the choice of the recognition method for actuarial gains and losses from occupational pension schemes. Using a unique sample of European companies, this problem is well suited for demonstrating the effectiveness of our lexicographic ranker. Furthermore, we conduct a series of experiments on benchmark data from the machine learning domain.

AB  - New product portfolio selection is a multi-criteria decision making problem including both qualitative and quantitative criteria. Determining the exact values for these criteria is often difficult or even impossible taking into account uncertainty and complexity associated with new product development projects. To assist managers in making portfolio selection decisions, this study proposes a new project portfolio selection model that uses a fuzzy weighted average approach for ranking new product projects and artificial neural networks for estimating project performance. New product development projects are evaluated according to criteria related to marketing, project team, project performance, risk, and strategy. The use of neural networks enables more precise evaluation of project performance criteria and provides additional information in portfolio selection. A case study of the evaluation of new product projects illustrates the usefulness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Realization of the importance for advanced tool and techniques to secure the network infrastructure from the security risks has led to the development of many machine learning based intrusion detection techniques. However, the benefits and limitations of these techniques make the development of an efficient Intrusion Detection System (IDS), an open challenge. This paper presents an adaptive, and a robust intrusion detection technique using Hypergraph based Genetic Algorithm (HG - GA) for parameter setting and feature selection in Support Vector Machine (SVM). Hyper – clique property of Hypergraph was exploited for the generation of initial population to fasten the search for the optimal solution and to prevent the trap at the local minima. HG-GA uses a weighted objective function to maintain the trade-off between maximizing the detection rate and minimizing the false alarm rate, along with the optimal number of features. The performance of HG-GA SVM was evaluated using NSL-KDD intrusion dataset under two scenarios (i) All features and (ii) informative features obtained from HG – GA. Experimental results show the prominence of HG-GA SVM over the existing techniques in terms of classifier accuracy, detection rate, false alarm rate, and runtime analysis.

AB  - Remanufacturing process planning plays a key role in implementing remanufacturing because it directly affects the remanufacturing cost as well as energy consumption and quality. Due to the uncertainty of the quality of returned used components, which are the raw materials for remanufacturing, remanufacturing process planning is far more complex than that for mass production of virgin products. In order to generate the optimal process planning, an optimization method is presented to characterize fault features for remanufacturing process planning. In this method, Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE) are applied to identify fault features and quantify damage degrees respectively, and Rule Reasoning (RR) and Operation Digraph (OD) methods are utilized to generate remanufacturing process plan alternatives, and then Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are integrated to the optimal alternative selection. Finally, a used worm gear is taken as an example to illustrate the validity and practicality of the proposed method of remanufacturing process planning, the results of which showed the proposed method is effective in optimization of remanufacturing process planning.

AB  - Electric mobility is regarded as an important option for reducing environmental impacts of transport. State incentives and planning efforts for the mass deployment of a public charging infrastructure (CI) are in hand in many countries; in particular, public CIs based on the Level 3 DC fast charge are most likely to become commercially viable in the short to medium term, as the drivers are more likely to view the operation as traditional refuelling. The aim of this work is to develop a procedure for the evaluation of the level of service of a configuration of electric fast charging stations (CI scenario), located in a selected urban area of the city of Rome. By varying the configuration of the stations in the area, and taking into account a charge demand inferred from real-world traffic data, we are able to make comparative analyses among different CI scenarios, and to determine the best one in terms of average and maximum waiting time to recharge (demand-side analysis). The steps considered included: creation of realistic CI scenarios based on lists of existing car parks and petrol stations; estimation of the potential battery electrical vehicle (BEV) users in the selected urban area using a Big Data analysis procedure; development of a fuzzy model to assign BEV users to stations with a criterion of convenience; use of a simulation procedure of all the charge events, in order to obtain a time profile of customer crowding at stations.

AB  - This paper aims at generating as well as extracting design strategies for a real world problem using an evolutionary learning classifier system. Data mining for a design optimization result as a virtual database specifies design information and discovers latent design knowledge. It is essential for decision making in real world problems. Although we employed several methods from classic statistics to artificial intelligence to obtain design information from optimization results, we may not cognize anything beyond a prepared database. In this study, we have applied an evolutionary learning classifier system as a data mining technique to a real world engineering problem. Consequently, not only it extracted known design information but also it successfully generated design strategies not to extract from the database. The generated design rules do not physically become innovative knowledge because the prepared dataset include Pareto solutions owing to complete exploration to the edge of the feasible region in the optimization. However, this problem is independent of the method, our evolutionary learning classifier system is a useful method for incomplete datasets.

AB  - In practice, selecting an energy project for development requires balancing criteria and competing stakeholder priorities to identify the best alternative. Energy source selection can be modeled as multi-criteria decision-maker problems to provide quantitative support to reconcile technical, economic, environmental, social, and political factors with respect to the stakeholders' interests. Decision making among these complex interactions should also account for the uncertainty present in the input data. In response, this work develops a stochastic decision analysis framework to evaluate alternatives by involving stakeholders to identify both quantitative and qualitative selection criteria and performance metrics which carry uncertainties. The developed framework is illustrated using a case study from Fairbanks, Alaska, where decision makers and residents must decide on a new source of energy for heating and electricity. We approach this problem in a five step methodology: (1) engaging experts (role players) to develop criteria of project performance; (2) collecting a range of quantitative and qualitative input information to determine the performance of each proposed solution according to the selected criteria; (3) performing a Monte-Carlo analysis to capture uncertainties given in the inputs; (4) applying multi-criteria decision-making, social choice (voting), and fallback bargaining methods to account for three different levels of cooperation among the stakeholders; and (5) computing an aggregate performance index (API) score for each alternative based on its performance across criteria and cooperation levels. API scores communicate relative performance between alternatives. In this way, our methodology maps uncertainty from the input data to reflect risk in the decision and incorporates varying degrees of cooperation into the analysis to identify an optimal and practical alternative.

AB  - In the current era of sustainable development, energy planning has become complex due to the involvement of multiple benchmarks like technical, social, economic and environmental. This in turn puts major constraints for decision makers to optimize energy alternatives independently and discretely especially in case of rural communities. In addition, topographical limitations concerning renewable energy systems which are mostly distributed in nature, the energy planning becomes more complicated. In such cases, decision analysis plays a vital role for designing such systems by considering various criteria and objectives even at disintegrated levels of electrification. Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) is a branch of operational research dealing with finding optimal results in complex scenarios including various indicators, conflicting objectives and criteria. This tool is becoming popular in the field of energy planning due to the flexibility it provides to the decision makers to take decisions while considering all the criteria and objectives simultaneously. This article develops an insight into various MCDM techniques, progress made by considering renewable energy applications over MCDM methods and future prospects in this area. An extensive review in the sphere of sustainable energy has been performed by utilizing MCDM technique.

The effect of design parameters, including inlet flow velocity, inlet flow temperature, U-tube diameter, borehole diameter and pipe spacing on the entropy generation number (EGN) and the integrated evaluation factor were analyzed, respectively. Furthermore, the optimization results using MOGA approach and Screening approach were compared. Finally, the multi-objective design optimization was carried on GHEs and the results were verified in the GSHP system simulation platform using TRNSYS software. The results illustrated that both the MOGA optimization approach and the Screening approach using the Kriging model could improve the thermal performance of GHEs. Furthermore, the thermal performance of optimal results in the MOGA approach was superior to that in the Screening approach. Compared with the original GHE, the average energy consumption of heat pump of the optimal GHE in the MOGA approach decreased by 215.86kJ·h-1, while that in the Screening approach declined by 133.64kJ·h-1 .

AB  - Football is one of the most popular sports in the world. Professional football has become a significant contributor to global economics and business. The game attracts considerable funds, which motivate participants of the sporting process (players, coaches, club owners, administration, etc.) to strive for better athletic results. However, such a motivation simultaneously promotes internal and external rivalry. The increasing number of players, the teams’ desire to attract better team members, and the improved athletes’ performance boost the use of assessment and rating processes. The most popular and widely used player rating systems are based on performance statistics, which reflect situational factors of the game. Most specialists believe that such systems lack objectivity. Thus, this paper presents a new methodology to assess and rank football players based on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). A hands-on study is conducted for the assessment. A sample of 24 players is grouped into four separate groups consisting of six players for each group. The age of U17 is examined by 12 tests distributed as follows: three anthropometrics, five fitness, and four skills tests. Players are ranked on the basis of a set of measurement metric outcomesusing the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method to select the appropriate player using a one-shot experiment. Then, this study utilizes the mean and standard deviation to ensure that the four groups of players undergo systematic ranking, respectively. Findings are as follows: (1) systematic: TOPSIS is an effective tool used to solve player selection problems, and (2) statistics: group number one is the best group among the four groups, identical to the results of the system.

AB  - Spatial Simulation is a spatially explicit, bottom-up modelling approach that includes individual-based models and cellular automata. While spatial heterogeneity and individual variation have been considered as noise in the past, this is exactly what has become the centre of interest of the individual-based paradigm in ecology. According to Individual-based Ecology, the interaction and behaviour of individual organisms leads to the emergence of macro-level patterns on the system scale. Although individual-based models have almost always been spatially explicit, the focus was commonly given to temporal processes and behavioural rules over spatial aspects. Today, the wide availability of spatial data and ever increasing computational power together with a strive for realistic models has renewed the attention to spatial aspects in simulation modelling. This review provides an overview of the state of the art of Spatial Simulation modelling in Ecology, reviews its limitations and open issues and it discusses future research avenues by taking an explicit geospatial perspective. The main avenues that are discussed revolve around the role of spatial context to determine the structure of living systems, potentials of hybrid top-down/bottom-up model designs to integrate hierarchical, spatial and temporal scales of ecological systems, and current trends in the representation and analysis of simulated spatio-temporal (big) data.

AB  - In the manufacturing domain, interoperability represents a characteristic of a manufacturing system in which its components are capable of exchanging information with one another, using the information that has been exchanged. Even though the discussion about interoperability issues can trace back to the 1970s, system interoperability is still the “elephant in the room”. Additionally, in the past few years, research topics related to the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, have been gradually accepted and promoted by governments and organizations all around the world. A research question then arises: what is the role of interoperability in the fourth industrial revolution era? The aim of this paper is to provide a scientific and evidence-based answer to this question. From an academic perspective, a systematic literature review was carried out to discover the main concepts related to interoperability in an Industry 4.0 context. From an industrial perspective, a questionnaire survey was developed to guide the application of a multi-criteria decision analysis method, the Analytic Hierarchy Process, used to analyze and make explicit the relationships of the previously discovered concepts. Results of this study can be used as a basis for future interoperability research in this new industrial revolution wave.

AB  - Optimum production from a hydrocarbon field takes place when technical parameters are optimized with respect to the operational and economic constraints. Well control parameters have an important role in making decisions for choosing efficient production scenario in a reservoir. Among the economical constraints cost of drilling and completion of wells, transportation and refinery costs and price of oil and gas can be named. In this paper, using single well model, the design of experiments and multi criteria decision making, determination of optimum production scenario based on a sector of South Pars gas field is addressed. Flow rate, well spacing, minimum wellhead pressure, production string size, deviation of wells and type of stimulation are decision parameters that are considered in this study. Economic indices chosen for economic analysis are net present value, internal rate of return and plateau time. First using the design of experiments and response surface methodology, proxy models are generated to predict economic indices for production scenarios and after validation of them, they are used for economic analysis and choosing the best scenario based on multi-criteria decision making.

AB  - Prequalification helps decision makers find the right contractor for the job, which is key to the successful delivery of a construction project. The procedure involves judging the suitability, capability and competency of the contractor on various criteria, using both anecdotal and empirical evidence. The evidence used is often imprecise and subjective, and so is the evaluation and decision making procedure. Type-1 fuzzy sets have been used in the prequalification procedure to handle uncertain information. However, type-1 fuzzy sets are unable to reflect the differences in opinion among experts involved in group decision making. The purpose of this paper is to propose a practical prequalification procedure that uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets to address both linguistic imprecision and differences of opinion. A numerical example shows how the proposed procedure is carried out and the benefits that result compared to a similar procedure using type-1 fuzzy sets.

AB  - The deployment of Hybrid Offshore Wind and Wave Energy Systems (HOWiWaES) towards the simultaneous exploitation of the corresponding offshore renewable energy sources, may efficiently address the common challenge of the offshore wind and the wave energy sector to reduce their costs, with multiple additional benefits. A prerequisite at an early stage of the realization of a HOWiWaES project is the determination of marine areas suitable for the deployment of HOWiWaES. In the present paper, a methodological framework for identifying the most appropriate marine areas in Greece towards the deployment/siting of HOWiWaES is developed and presented. The framework is based on the combined use of multi-criteria decision making methods and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). At the first stage of the analysis, the unsuitable for the deployment of HOWiWaES marine areas are identified through the development of a GIS database that produces thematic maps representing exclusion criteria related to utilization restrictions as well as to economic, technical and social constraints. Then, at the second stage of the analysis, eligible marine areas not satisfying exclusion criteria are evaluated and ranked using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), based on evaluation criteria related to economic, technical and socio-political factors. The AHP's implementation is supported by the developed GIS database, eliminating significantly the subjectivity in judgments. The results of the paper illustrate the potential for deploying HOWiWaES in Greece, especially in the offshore areas of Crete and in a lengthwise zone extended from North-central to central Aegean.

AB  - Determination of adequate parameter settings for improvement of multiple quality and productivity characteristics at the same time is of great practical importance in laser cutting. This paper discusses the application of the preference selection index (PSI) method for discrete optimization of the CO2 laser cutting of stainless steel. The main motivation for application of the PSI method is that it represents an almost unexplored multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method, and moreover, this method does not require assessment of the considered criteria relative significances. After reviewing and comparing the existing approaches for determination of laser cutting parameter settings, the application of the PSI method was explained in detail. Experiment realization was conducted by using Taguchi's L27 orthogonal array. Roughness of the cut surface, heat affected zone (HAZ), kerf width and material removal rate (MRR) were considered as optimization criteria. The proposed methodology is found to be very useful in real manufacturing environment since it involves simple calculations which are easy to understand and implement. However, while applying the PSI method it was observed that it can not be useful in situations where there exist a large number of alternatives which have attribute values (performances) very close to those which are preferred.

AB  - Innovative technologies, such as 3D depth cameras, promote the development of natural interaction applications in many domains among large audiences. In this context, supervised machine learning techniques have been proved to be a flexible and robust approach to perform high level gesture recognition from 3D joints provided by these depth cameras. This paper proposes a lightweight approach to recognize gestures with Kinect by utilizing approximate string matching. The proposed approach encodes the movements of the joints as sequences of characters in order to simplify the gesture recognition as a widely studied string matching problem. We evaluated our approach by applying other widespread used techniques in the research field. The experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach can obtain relatively high performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. These findings provide further evidence that our approach could be a viable strategy for recognizing gestures, even in devices with medium and low processing capability (e.g., smartphones, tablets, etc.).

The projects ranked included a food waste-biogas project in Beijing, a food waste-biogas project in Suzhou and a co-digestion project producing biomethane in Hainan. The projects were ranked from best to worst based on technical, economic and environmental criteria under the MCDA framework. The results demonstrated that some projects are encountering operational problems. Based on these findings, six national policy recommendations were provided: (1) shift away from capital investment subsidies to performance-based subsidies; (2) re-design feed in tariffs; (3) promote bio-methane and project clustering; (4) improve collection efficiency by incentivizing FW producers to direct waste to biogas projects; (5) incentivize biogas projects to produce multiple outputs; (6) incentivize food waste-based projects to co-digest food waste with other substrates for higher gas output.

AB  - A large number of journals and special volumes are publishing research concerned with sustainable supply chain (SSC). The importance of this the topic has significantly grown over time thus receiving increased attention from academics and practitioners in this area. This research critically analyzes the content of 286 papers published in different journals in the area over the span of fifteen years (2002–2016). The reviewed literature was structured using the following categories: year, journal, research methodology, research design, operation research (OR)/mathematical tools and techniques, data analysis technique, industry sector, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), authors, universities, country, enablers, and barriers. This enabled crucial gaps in knowledge of SSC to be identified allowing future research opportunities in the field to be determined. The major finding indicates that the research field is being dominated by the qualitative study. Also, of the quantitatively based studies that appeared in the literature, linear programming problem is the most often used solution approach to optimize the complex sustainable supply chain management problems. Drawn results show that there is enough scope to expand the research field and several opportunities still exist which needs to be investigated such as quantitative modeling, use of advance techniques and development of efficient algorithms.

AB  - In this paper, a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is used to visualize corrective actions of failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA). SOM is a popular unsupervised neural network model that aims to produce a low-dimensional map (typically a two-dimensional map) for visualizing high-dimensional data. With regards to FMEA, it is a popular methodology to identify potential failure modes for a product or a process, to assess the risk associated with those failure modes, also, to identify and carry out corrective actions to address the most serious concerns. Despite the popularity of FMEA in a wide range of industries, two well-known shortcomings are the complexity of the FMEA worksheet and its intricacy of use. To the best of our knowledge, the use of computation techniques for solving the aforementioned shortcomings is limited. The use of SOM in FMEA is new. In this paper, corrective actions in FMEA are described in their severity, occurrence and detect scores. SOM is then used as a visualization aid for FMEA users to see the relationship among corrective actions via a map. Color information from the SOM map is then included to the FMEA worksheet for better visualization. In addition, a Risk Priority Number Interval is used to allow corrective actions to be evaluated and ordered in groups. Such approach provides a quick and easily understandable framework to elucidate important information from a complex FMEA worksheet; therefore facilitating the decision-making tasks by FMEA users. The significance of this study is two-fold, viz., the use of SOM as an effective neural network learning paradigm to facilitate FMEA implementations, and the use of a computational visualization approach to tackle the two well-known shortcomings of FMEA.

AB  - The nature of management accountants' responsibility is evolving from merely reporting aggregated historical value to also including organizational performance measurement and providing management with decision related information. Corporate information systems such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have provided management accountants with both expanded data storage power and enhanced computational power. With big data extracted from both internal and external data sources, management accountants now could utilize data analytics techniques to answer the questions including: what has happened (descriptive analytics), what will happen (predictive analytics), and what is the optimized solution (prescriptive analytics). However, research shows that the nature and scope of managerial accounting has barely changed and that management accountants employ mostly descriptive analytics, some predictive analytics, and a bare minimum of prescriptive analytics. This paper proposes a Managerial Accounting Data Analytics (MADA) framework based on the balanced scorecard theory in a business intelligence context. MADA provides management accountants the ability to utilize comprehensive business analytics to conduct performance measurement and provide decision related information. With MADA, three types of business analytics (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive) are implemented into four corporate performance measurement perspectives (financial, customer, internal process, and learning and growth) in an enterprise system environment. Other related issues that affect the successful utilization of business analytics within a corporate-wide business intelligence (BI) system, such as data quality and data integrity, are also discussed. This paper contributes to the literature by discussing the impact of business analytics on managerial accounting from an enterprise systems and BI perspective and by providing the Managerial Accounting Data Analytics (MADA) framework that incorporates balanced scorecard methodology.

AB  - Decision making problems are becoming increasingly complicated. Consequently, the developed methods to support decision makers are more and more general. Group decision-making is a very common scenario. When a team of decision makers is faced with a problem, it is natural to assume that due to diversity of their backgrounds and experience they may require different ways of providing their evaluations and opinions. A very common, and quite unreasonable, assumption made by decision-making methods that deal with groups of decision makers is to consider that all decision makers agreed on a unique criteria set to evaluate given alternatives. Criteria interaction is another common issue in multi-criteria decision making and it is normally addressed using Choquet integral, which alone brings another serious problem of capacity identification. In addition, the decision-making environments are rarely static. Aiming to address all these issues at once, we propose two generalized approaches based on the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive and Multi-Criteria Decision Making). The new methods are able to consider groups of decision makers with all their different opinions, heterogeneous types of information, criteria interaction, fuzzy measure identification and dynamic environments. The methods are applied in two examples and two case studies showing their feasibility in solving complex real world problems.

Answering the questions: “What is the KnoSys community interested in?” and “How does such interest change over time?” are important to both the editorial board and audience of KnoSys. This paper conducts a topic-based bibliometric study to detect and predict the topic changes of KnoSys from 1991 to 2016. A Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is used to profile the hotspots of KnoSys and predict possible future trends from a probabilistic perspective. A model of scientific evolutionary pathways applies a learning-based process to detect the topic changes of KnoSys in sequential time slices. Six main research areas of KnoSys are identified, i.e., expert systems, machine learning, data mining, decision making, optimization, and fuzzy, and the results also indicate that the interest of KnoSys communities in the area of computational intelligence is raised, and the ability to construct practical systems through knowledge use and accurate prediction models is highly emphasized. Such empirical insights can be used as a guide for KnoSys submissions.

AB  - Integration of solar power and diesel generators (DGs) together with battery storage has proven to be an efficient choice for stand-alone power systems (SAPS). For higher energy efficiency, heat recovery from exhaust gas of the DG can also be employed to supply all or a portion of the thermal energy demand. Although the design of such heat recovery systems (HRSs) has been studied, the effect of solar power integration has not been taken into account. In this paper, a new approach for practical design of these systems based on varying engine loads is presented. Fast and elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) equipped with a novel local search was used for the design process, considering conflicting objectives of annual energy recovery and total cost of the system, and six design variables. An integrated power system, designed for a remote SAPS, was used to evaluate the design approach. The optimum power supply system was first designed using the commercial software Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER), based on power demand and global solar energy in the region. Heat recovery design was based on the outcome of HOMER for DG hourly load, considering different power scenarios. The proposed approach improves the annual heat recovery of the PV/DG/battery system by 4%, PV/battery by 1.7%, and stand-alone DG by 1.8% when compared with a conventional design based on nominal DG load. The results prove that the proposed approach is effective and that load calculations should be taken into account prior to designing HRSs for SAPS.

AB  - The costly and time-consuming determination of thermophysical properties of nanofluids through the experimental analysis leads the current investigations to use the soft computing methods like correlating, artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm. In this study, the application of ANN, empirical correlations and genetic algorithm for modeling and multi-criteria optimization of the thermophysical properties of clove-treated MWCNTs nanofluid which has been synthesized through a facile and eco-friendly procedure has been investigated. In this contribution, totally 6 structures are assessed: networks including one and two hidden layers with 2, 4, and 6 neurons. From assessment of the ANN, it is found that the network including two hidden layers with 4 neurons in every layer results in the least difference between the network outputs and the experimental data, providing the best performance. It is concluded that the optimal ANN model is a more precise and accurate way to predict the thermal conductivity and viscosity of environmentally friendly C-MWCNT/water nanofluid compared to empirical correlations obtained from non-linear regression method. Moreover, the evolutionary algorithm has been implemented for achieving the optimal conditions to maximize the thermal conductivity and to minimize the viscosity of nanofluid. In this regard, based on real-world engineering experience, the final optimal solutions opted from several distinguished procedures of decision-making including the Bellman-Zadeh, TOPSIS and LINMAP approaches has been investigated in parallel. The results of this study revealed that the obtained outputs using TOPSIS and LINMAP procedures are the closest to ideal solution.

AB  - Truly successful designs are characterized by both satisfaction of design goals and the presence of desirable physical features. Experienced design professionals are able to exercise their cognition to satisfy both aspects to a high degree. However, complex design tasks represent challenges for human cognition, and as such computational decision support systems emerge as a relevant topic. We present a computational decision support framework for treating preferences related to physical design features. The proposed framework is based on auto-associative machine learning models that inductively learn relationships between design features characterizing highly performing designs. The knowledge matter to be learned is derived through multi-objective stochastic optimization. The resulting auto-associative models are excited with a preference vector containing a favorable composition of design features. The models are able to alleviate those relationships that result in shortcomings of performance. The model thus outputs well performing design solution, where preferences pertaining to physical features are also satisfied, to the extent possible. The paper focuses on the applicability of the proposed approach in architectural design, as an exceptional example of complex design, discusses methods to evaluate model performance, and validates the proposed method through an application focusing on the design of a sustainable façade.

In this paper, we address the multi-objective inter-terminal truck routing problem by specifically considering truck emissions. We present an efficient multi-objective archived simulated annealing approach and a visualization technique. Managerial insights are discussed based on an analysis of trade-offs. The algorithm is embedded in a cloud-based decision support system to consider contextual data, including traffic data and the current positions of trucks. This allows ports to utilize potentials of digitalization and optimization while addressing environmental issues.

AB  - There are situations in which lexicon-based methods for Sentiment Analysis (SA) are not able to generate a classification output for specific instances of a given dataset. Most often, the reason for this situation is the absence of specific terms in the sentiment lexicon required in the classification effort. In such cases, there were only two possible paths to follow: (1) add terms to the lexicon (off-line process) by human intervention to guarantee no noise is introduced into the lexicon, which prevents the classification system to provide an immediate answer; or (2) use the services of a word-frequency dictionary (on-line process), which is computationally costly to build. This paper investigates an alternative approach to compensate for the lack of ability of a lexicon-based method to produce a classification output. The method is based on the combination of the classification outputs of non lexicon-based tools. Specifically, firstly the outcome values of applying two or more non-lexicon classification methods are obtained. Secondly, these non-lexicon outcomes are fused using a uninorm based approach, which has been proved to have desirable compensation properties as required in the SA context, to generate the classification output the lexicon based approach is unable to achieve. Experimental results based on the execution of two well-known supervised machine learning algorithms, namely Naïve Bayes and Maximum Entropy, and the application of a cross-ratio uninorm operator are presented. Performance indices associated to options (1) and (2) above are compared against the results obtained using the proposed approach for two different datasets. Additionally, the performance of the proposed cross-ratio uninorm operator based approach is also compared when the aggregation operator used is the arithmetic mean instead. It is shown that the combination of non lexicon-based classification methods with specific uninorm operators improves the classification performance of lexicon-based methods, and it enables the offering of an alternative solution to the SA classification problem when needed. The proposed aggregation method could be used as well as a replacement of ensemble averaging techniques commonly applied when combining the results of several machine learning classifiers’ outputs.

AB  - Real-world optimization problems typically involve multiple objectives to be optimized simultaneously under multiple constraints and with respect to several variables. While multi-objective optimization itself can be a challenging task, equally difficult is the ability to make sense of the obtained solutions. In this two-part paper, we deal with data mining methods that can be applied to extract knowledge about multi-objective optimization problems from the solutions generated during optimization. This knowledge is expected to provide deeper insights about the problem to the decision maker, in addition to assisting the optimization process in future design iterations through an expert system. The current paper surveys several existing data mining methods and classifies them by methodology and type of knowledge discovered. Most of these methods come from the domain of exploratory data analysis and can be applied to any multivariate data. We specifically look at methods that can generate explicit knowledge in a machine-usable form. A framework for knowledge-driven optimization is proposed, which involves both online and offline elements of knowledge discovery. One of the conclusions of this survey is that while there are a number of data mining methods that can deal with data involving continuous variables, only a few ad hoc methods exist that can provide explicit knowledge when the variables involved are of a discrete nature. Part B of this paper proposes new techniques that can be used with such datasets and applies them to discrete variable multi-objective problems related to production systems.

AB  - Logistics infrastructure in several developing countries has been planned and developed in a haphazard way. Many decision makers normally specify its location based on their experience due to limited data source; and at the same time, disregard the spatial efficiency of the areas. The objectives of this study are (i) to develop a decision tool that helps store and analyse both primary and secondary data in a systematic manner; and (ii) to apply it for evaluating the spatial efficiency of transport logistics in a regional scale. The development of the decision support system is two-fold. One is the development of knowledge base. The study used the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) method to develop the decision solutions. To model the MCDM mechanism, various data and indicators related to logistics efficiency were acquired from both local and regional government and non-government organizations, study reports, and corporate studies. The study conducted a questionnaire survey from three expert groups: the academic group, the government officials, and the private companies. The study applied Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to designate the criteria used for the MCDM model and to determine the weights of each criterion. The second is the development of computer system. This study used the Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to analyse the MCDM model and visualize the spatial data. The proposed spatial decision-making tool embedded in a GIS platform can be a powerful tool to support decision made in case of highly complex spatial data. Such data related to efficiency evaluation can be visualized for the potential, advantages, and disadvantages of each area and can be used for strategic planning, enhancing logistics efficiency in regional areas.

AB  - Road Safety Analysis (RSA) ensure prevention of loss of human life and damage to property which is a procedure to assess the safety standards of a road and helps in the overall decision making process of road management. Road are to be prioritized based on Safety levels to identify the most vulnerable roads to provide mitigation measures. In this paper a study was carried out to determine the priority of safety requirements of a certain category of rural roads, viz., Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) roads in the Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan, India. Multi-criteria techniques were used to quantify the safety levels. Further analysis has also been done on the road having the worst safety features to rank various stretches. The parameters vital for safety have been selected and quantified using three multi-criteria decision making analysis tools: Simple Additive Weightage (SAW), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy AHP methods and results are compared. The methodology presented herein gives an insight to prioritize roads for safety mitigation measures which is expected to be useful to various Decision Makers.

AB  - In Italy, the recent wolf expansion process is the result of a series of historical, natural, ecological and conservation related factors that have characterized the Italian environmental context during the last few decades. The difficulties in broaching the environmental management of the wolf species have increased economic conflicts, mainly with livestock farmers. To facilitate and pacify the debate, an assessment of the risk of wolf attacks on livestock farms in Umbria’s municipalities needed to be carried out. For this assessment, AHPSort II, a new multi-criteria sorting method for a large number of alternatives, has been developed. This is used for sorting the alternatives into predefined, ordered risk categories. It requires far fewer comparisons than its predecessor, AHPSort. This sorting method can be applied to different environmental problems that have a large number of alternatives. In our case study, AHPSort II requires only 1.4% of the comparisons that would have been required by AHPSort. Combined with clustering, only 0.54% of the comparisons are required. The resulting map shows that a high number of municipalities are at risk, especially those near protected areas.

AB  - Recommender systems have emerged in the e-commerce domain and are developed to actively recommend the right items to online users. Traditional Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems recommend the items to users based on their single-rating feedback which are used to match similar users. In multi-criteria CF recommender systems, however, multi-criteria ratings are used instead of single-rating feedback which can significantly improve the accuracy of traditional CF algorithms. These systems have been successfully implemented in Tourism domain. In this paper, we propose a new recommendation method based on multi-criteria CF to enhance the predictive accuracy of recommender systems in tourism domain using clustering, dimensionality reduction and prediction methods. We use Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) as prediction techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a dimensionality reduction technique and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Expectation Maximization (EM) as two well-known clustering techniques. To improve the recommendation accuracy of proposed multi-criteria CF, a cluster ensembles approach, Hypergraph Partitioning Algorithm (HGPA), is applied on SOM and EM clustering results. We evaluate the accuracy of recommendation method on TripAdvisior dataset. Our experiments confirm that cluster ensembles can provide better predictive accuracy for the proposed recommendation method in relation to the methods which solely rely on single clustering techniques.

AB  - Manufacturing systems are often characterized by a stochastic and uncertain behavior in which frequent changes and unpredictable events may occur over time. Moreover, the customers’ demands can sometime evolve drastically along time. In order to cope with such changes in the manufacturing system state, and to optimize given performance criteria, the assignment of multi-skilled workers to the machines in the system can be decided online, in a dynamic manner, whenever workers become available and need to be assigned. Indeed, the starting and completion times of jobs in such systems cannot be predicted, so that static optimization approaches turn out not to be relevant. Several studies, in the ergonomics literature, have outlined that the operators' performances often decline because of their fatigue in work. In particular, in manufacturing contexts, fatigue can increase the processing times of jobs. Several online heuristic have been published, but to the best of our knowledge, they do not cope with this consequence of fatigue. We propose to solve this dynamic multi-skilled workers assignment problem using a new methodology, which aims to provide an adaptable dynamic assignment heuristic, which is used online. Our approach takes the impact of fatigue into consideration, in order to minimize the mean flowtime of jobs in the system. We suggest computing more realistic task durations, in accordance with the worker's fatigue. The heuristic uses a multi-criteria analysis, in order to find a compromise that favors short processing times and avoids congestions. The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is used to select the machine where to assign the worker. Since in our case no expertise is available, an offline adaptation process, based on simulation optimization, is used to identify the weights needed by TOPSIS, so as to better fit with the system specificities. A Job-Shop system is simulated to illustrate the proposed approach. The performance of the suggested heuristic is assessed and compared to two other workers assignment rules, which are widely used in the scientific literature because of their efficiency on the mean flowtime: SPT and LNQ. The comparisons are made under different conditions (staffing level, operators’ flexibility). A sensitivity analysis is also performed to analyze the impact of the way how fatigue affects the task duration. Our experimental results show that our heuristic provides better results in every case studied. Several important research directions are finally pointed out.

AB  - In the era of big data, we are facing with an immense volume and high velocity of data with complex structures. Data can be produced by online and offline transactions, social networks, sensors and through our daily life activities. A proper processing of big data can result in informative, intelligent and relevant decision making completed in various areas, such as medical and healthcare, business, management and government. To handle big data more efficiently, new research paradigm has been engaged but the ways of thinking about big data call for further long-term innovative pursuits. Fuzzy sets have been employed for big data processing due to their abilities to represent and quantify aspects of uncertainty. Several innovative approaches within the framework of Granular Computing have been proposed. To summarize the current contributions and present an outlook of further developments, this overview addresses three aspects: (1) We review the recent studies from two distinct views. The first point of view focuses on what types of fuzzy set techniques have been adopted. It identifies clear trends as to the usage of fuzzy sets in big data processing. Another viewpoint focuses on the explanation of the benefits of fuzzy sets in big data problems. We analyze when and why fuzzy sets work in these problems. (2) We present a critical review of the existing problems and discuss the current challenges of big data, which could be potentially and partially solved in the framework of fuzzy sets. (3) Based on some principles, we infer the possible trends of using fuzzy sets in big data processing. We stress that some more sophisticated augmentations of fuzzy sets and their integrations with other tools could offer a novel promising processing environment.

AB  - In recent years, machine learning research has gained momentum: new developments in the field of deep learning allow for multiple levels of abstraction and are starting to supersede well-known and powerful tree-based techniques mainly operating on the original feature space. All these methods can be applied to various fields, including finance. This paper implements and analyzes the effectiveness of deep neural networks (DNN), gradient-boosted-trees (GBT), random forests (RAF), and several ensembles of these methods in the context of statistical arbitrage. Each model is trained on lagged returns of all stocks in the S&P 500, after elimination of survivor bias. From 1992 to 2015, daily one-day-ahead trading signals are generated based on the probability forecast of a stock to outperform the general market. The highest k probabilities are converted into long and the lowest k probabilities into short positions, thus censoring the less certain middle part of the ranking. Empirical findings are promising. A simple, equal-weighted ensemble (ENS1) consisting of one deep neural network, one gradient-boosted tree, and one random forest produces out-of-sample returns exceeding 0.45 percent per day for k=10, prior to transaction costs. Irrespective of the fact that profits are declining in recent years, our findings pose a severe challenge to the semi-strong form of market efficiency.

AB  - Globalization leads the modern world towards green sources of energy. Green energy is clean sources of energy that have a lower environmental impact compared to conventional energy technology. Green energy plays a significant role in the strategic energy planning process for any country. Regarding energy resources, India plays an important part on the world scene. However, the energy systems of the different regions and territories varied on various parameters. Therefore, a detailed green energy planning for sustainable development has been studied extensively to find the most suitable common strategy for energy management to answer the following questions: (i) which approaches were predominantly applied in a particular region? (ii) Which evaluating criteria were paid more intentness to energy planning for sustainable development in that region? (iii) Is there any inadequacy of the approaches?. Various decision-making strategies, integrated approaches, combined methods have proposed to characterize the energy management problem by different researchers. In modern power management, the performance of different green energy is evaluated against multiple criteria rather than considering a single factor-consumption. This paper reviews the various work on distinct approaches, integrated approaches, multi-criteria decision-making methods, etc., for green energy planning and scheduling problem. This research not only provides confirmation that the energy management strategies are better than the traditional methods, but also aids the researchers and decision makers in applying the procedures.

AB  - Supplier selection is a critical multi-criteria decision making problem for supply chain management. With the emergence of big data, there is an urgent need for data-driven decision making methods. A hybrid DEA-Adaboost model is proposed to meet the challenge. The proposed model is split into the DEA and the learner. The fuzzy multi-objective DEA is used to build the expert database, which contains the appropriate and inappropriate suppliers. The learner is trained by Adaboost from the expert database. Thus, the DEA and derived learner are combined as the hybrid model to reduce the time consumption and computational complexities for suppliers selection. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model improves the accuracy compared with other two approaches.

AB  - Universal electricity access is an important development objective, and the focus of a number of key global UN initiatives. While robust electricity planning is widely believed to be a prerequisite for effective electrification, to date, no comprehensive overview of electricity planning research has been undertaken on sub-Saharan Africa, the world region with the lowest access rates. This paper reviews quantitative and qualitative electricity planning and related implementation research, considering each of the 49 sub-Saharan African countries, the four regional power pools and the sub-continent as a whole. Applying a broad understanding of electricity planning and a practical limit of 20 reviewed articles per country and region, 306 relevant peer-reviewed journal articles are included in this review. A general classification scheme is introduced that classifies the planning literature along the addressed value chain depth, number of different analysed criteria and number of evaluated decision alternatives. The literature is found to be strongly clustered in a few countries, with less than 5 identified relevant articles in 36 of the 49 countries. The total amount of articles per year is clearly increasing over time, addressing technology choice, operation, distribution and implementation analyses. Although including different high-level criteria in analysing electricity systems is common, the literature is only starting to use formalised multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) tools. The review indicates that 63% of relevant articles favour renewable energy technologies for their given problems. Frequently mentioned success factors for electrification in sub-Saharan Africa include adequate policy design, sufficient finance and favourable political conditions. While considerable regional and methodological literature gaps are apparent, the literature in this review identifies a rich and fruitful ground for future research to fill these gaps.

AB  - Objective
To integrate multiple sources of clinical information with patient feedback to build evidence-based decision support model to facilitate treatment selection for patients suffering from vestibular schwannomas (VS).
Methods
This was a mixed methods study utilizing focus group and survey methodology to solicit feedback on factors important for making treatment decisions among patients. Two 90-minute focus groups were conducted by an experienced facilitator. Previously diagnosed VS patients were recruited by clinical investigators at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). Classical content analysis was used for focus group data analysis. Providers were recruited from practices within the UPMC system and were surveyed using Delphi methods. This information can provide a basis for multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework to develop a treatment decision support system for patients with VS.
Results
Eight themes were derived from these data (focus group + surveys): doctor/health care system, side effects, effectiveness of treatment, anxiety, mortality, family/other people, quality of life, and post-operative symptoms. These data, as well as feedback from physicians were utilized in building a multi-criteria decision model.
Discussion
The study illustrated steps involved in the development of a decision support model that integrates evidence-based data and patient values to select treatment alternatives.
Conclusions
Studies focusing on the actual development of the decision support technology for this group of patients are needed, as decisions are highly multifactorial. Such tools have the potential to improve decision making for complex medical problems with alternate treatment pathways.

AB  - The subjectivity that underlies the notion of quality does not allow the design and development of a universally accepted mechanism for software quality assessment. This is why contemporary research is now focused on seeking mechanisms able to produce software quality models that can be easily adjusted to custom user needs. In this context, we introduce QATCH, an integrated framework that applies static analysis to benchmark repositories in order to generate software quality models tailored to stakeholder specifications. Fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making is employed in order to model the uncertainty imposed by experts’ judgments. These judgments can be expressed into linguistic values, which makes the process more intuitive. Furthermore, a robust software quality model, the base model, is generated by the system, which is used in the experiments for QATCH system verification. The paper provides an extensive analysis of QATCH and thoroughly discusses its validity and added value in the field of software quality through a number of individual experiments.

AB  - The advent of Big Data has seen both the sources and volumes of data increase rapidly. A multi-source information system can be used to represent information drawn from multiple sources. However, some of these sources are of less importance than others, and some are essentially worthless. Selecting the most valuable sources and efficiently fusing information are therefore core issues in the field of data science. To investigate this matter, we first propose internal-confidence and external-confidence degrees to estimate the reliability of each information source within a multi-source information system. A source selection principle is then constructed, allowing worthy and reliable information sources to be chosen. Furthermore, a new information fusion method is constructed by transforming the original information of each object into a triangular fuzzy information granule, and some uncertainty measures of this fusion process are studied. Finally, to interpret and comprehend the proposed theories and algorithm, extensive experiments are performed on six datasets to verify that our approach can deal with practical issues. The results indicate that the proposed triangular fuzzy granule fusion approach is efficient and effective for information fusion in multi-source datasets.

AB  - There has been an increasing growth in numerous applications that naturally generate large volumes of uncertain data. By the advent of such applications, the support of advanced analysis query processing such as the top-k and reverse top-k for uncertain big data has become important. In this paper, we model firstly probabilistic reverse top-k queries over uncertain big data for the discrete situation, in both monochromatic and bichromatic cases, denoted by MPRT and BPRT queries, respectively. We determine the partitions of solution space of MPRT queries and provide in theory a mathematical model for solving arbitrary dimensional data space. Additionally, we propose effective pruning heuristics to reduce the search space of BPRT queries. Moreover, efficient query procedures are presented seamlessly with integration of the proposed pruning strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approaches with various experimental settings.

AB  - The Analytic Network Process (ANP) is a subject of interest of the authors, which is included into methods of multi-criteria decision-making approach. The article covers the issue of supporting decisions involving experts. A network model structure was proposed, where the assessment of the decision variants on the set of criteria depends not only on the experts’ opinion, but also on the level of their competence. The possibility of taking into account the preferences for the criteria set by: a decision maker, experts or beneficiaries representing the decision-making options was also considered. The model’s performance was verified on the example of employee assessment. The results of the experiment have confirmed that the decision model developed can be formally represented in the computer decision support systems and delivered to the users in the form of a ready-made proposal (pattern).

AB  - Classic multi-criteria group decision making models that have a high amount of alternatives are unmanageable for the experts. This is because they have to provide one value per each alternative and criteria. In this paper, we focus on solving this issue by carrying out multi-criteria group decision making methods using a different novel approach. Concretely, fuzzy ontologies reasoning procedures are used in order to automatically obtain the alternatives ranking classification. Thanks to our novel methodology, experts only need to provide the importance of a small set of criteria values making it possible for experts to perform multi-criteria group decision making procedures that have a high amount of alternatives without having to directly deal with them. Furthermore, in order to allow experts to provide their preferences in a comfortable way, multi-granular fuzzy linguistic modelling is used in order to allow each expert to choose the linguistic label set that better fits him/her.

The main of objective of this study is to provide a review on the application and use of decision making approaches in regard to energy management problems. This paper selected and reviewed 196 published papers, from 1995 to 2015 in 72 important journals related to energy management, which chosen from the “Web of Science” database and in this regard, the systematic and meta-analysis method which called “PRISMA” has been proposed. All published papers were categorized into 13 different fields: environmental impact assessment, waste management, sustainability assessment, renewable energy, energy sustainability, land management, green management topics, water resources management, climate change, strategic environmental assessment, construction and environmental management and other energy management areas. Furthermore, papers were categorized based on the authors, publication year, nationality of authors, region, technique and application, number of criteria, research purpose, gap and contribution, solution and modeling, results and findings. Hybrid MCDM and fuzzy MCDM in the integrated methods were ranked as the first methods in use. The Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy Review was the important journal in this paper, with 32 published papers. Finally, environmental impact assessment was ranked as the first area that applied decision making approaches. Results of this study acknowledge that decision making approaches can help decision makers and stakeholders in solving some problems under uncertainties situations in environmental decision making and these approaches have seen increasing interest among previous researchers to use these approaches in various steps of environmental decision making process.

Sustainable development is possible if conditions of respect for the environment, preventing the exhaustion of natural resources and preserving the overall balance, are fulfilled. The necessity of the development and maintenance of habitats also emphasized. Construction processes have important role in creation of built environment and their impacts have to be measured as construction contributes to air pollution, land use and contamination, usage of resources, water and materials depletion, water pollution, impacts on human health, and climate change. Previous (own) research revealed, that the key categories of Web of Science, which encompass the research on the sustainable built environment, cover construction and building technologies, environmental science and studies, and civil engineering. The article presents a review of the literature on efforts to harmonize the construction processes, which was made on the basis of the Web of Science Core Collection database. The analysis of the number of publications was made according to years of publication and research areas. To honour the contribution made by Prof Oleg Kapliński in the field of Sustainable Development and Decision-Making, and to commemorate his 75th anniversary, this article also highlights his academic career and research.

AB  - Landslides are one of the most important natural hazards, causing serious financial damages and loss of life in many regions, including Iran. Landslide spatial modeling (LSM) in the current research consists of four phases including: (1) determining the relationship between each conditioning factor and landslide occurrences, using the evidential belief function (EBF) model; (2) utilizing LSM using three geographic information systems (GIS)-based machine-learning models, including the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and Naïve Bayes (NB); (3) evaluating considered models and selecting the best model using receiver operating characteristics and calculation of the area under the curve (AUC); and (4) feature selection and the rank of importance of conditioning factors using the learning vector quantization (LVQ) algorithm. In order to achieve this aim, first, a landslide inventory map with 146 disaster locations was prepared using national reports and field monitoring, and landslide locations were divided into a training (70%=102) and validating (30%=44) data set. Then, 12 landslide conditioning factors, such as aspect, altitude, drainage density, distance from faults, lithology, slope, land use, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance from rivers, distance from roads, and the topographic wetness index, were selected as input layers for the LSM in the Chahardangeh Watershed. In the next step, the EBF model was used to consider the relationship between landslide locations and the aforementioned conditioning factors. Subsequently, three GIS-based machine learning algorithms were applied for landslide susceptibility mapping, and their results were validated using AUC values. Finally, the LVQ algorithm was applied for feature selection and importance determination of different conditioning factors. The results showed that the RF model had the highest AUC value (83.3%), followed by the SVM, and the NB with AUC values of 75.7% and 72.5%, respectively. Also, the results of the LVQ model revealed that altitude, the distance from the road, lithology, and land use have the most effects on landslide occurrence, respectively. So, the landslide susceptibility maps can be used for land use planning, and the management of landslide hazards in this study area.

AB  - The variety and complexity in cloud marketplaces is growing, making it difficult for cloud consumers to choose cloud services from multiple providers in an economic and suitable way by taking into account multiple objectives and constraints. In this paper, we present an extension of CloudSim implementing cloud management functionality to enable the assessment of consumer-oriented brokering schemes. The underlying discrete-event simulation framework allows evaluating their performance in more realistic operating conditions in a repeatable manner. We integrate brokering mechanisms to support a multi-criteria location-aware selection of virtual machines in multi-cloud environments by implementing a greedy heuristic and two large neighborhood search metaheuristics. Based on microbenchmarks of real cloud offerings and a diverse set of scenarios and workloads, we conduct simulation experiments to assess the performance of our approaches. The results show that approximately 10 – 12% of the total costs can be saved by using a large neighborhood search approach compared to the greedy heuristic. Finally, we analyze and discuss the trade-off between costs and latency as well as the impact of region constraints, showing, e.g., that latency improvements often come at a high price and a greater regional flexibility can lead to latency improvements while solely optimizing costs. Using real data of cloud marketplaces, we show that the proposed CloudSim extension can support decision makers as a tool for assessing cloud portfolios and market dynamics.

AB  - With the arrival of on-board monitoring systems for aircraft structures, maintainers have access to a near real-time assessment of component health. Due to the traditional reliability assessment methods for aircraft structures lack of the ability to make full use of real-time status information collected by the monitoring systems, a new reliability evaluation method based on the real-time load information is proposed for aircraft structural reliability. Condition-based-maintenance is a maintenance scheme which recommends maintenance decisions according to equipment status collected by monitoring systems over a period of time. As most researches on condition-based maintenance for aircraft focused on solely minimizing maintenance cost or maximizing the availability of single aircraft, a multi-objective decision-making model based on condition-based-maintenance concentrated on both minimizing the maintenance cost and maximizing the availability of a fleet (total number of available aircraft in fleet) is established for an aircraft fleet. Finally, a maintenance decision-making support system (MDMSS) is developed based on the proposed model. The system integrates the process of data acquisition (real-time status information of aircraft), data processing (reliability assessment of aircraft structures) as well as maintenance decision-making. Therefore, it simplifies the complex process of equipment management and takes a step further in engineering application.

AB  - A Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) model was developed in order to predict the adipose/blood partition coefficient of environmental chemical compounds. The first step of QSAR modeling was the collection of inputs. Input data included the experimental values of adipose/blood partition coefficient and two sets of molecular descriptors for 67 organic chemical compounds; a) the descriptors from Linear Free Energy Relationship (LFER) and b) the PaDEL descriptors. The datasets were split to training and prediction set and were analysed using two statistical methods; Genetic Algorithm based Multiple Linear Regression (GA-MLR) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The models with LFER and PaDEL descriptors, coupled with ANN, produced satisfying performance results. The fitting performance (R2) of the models, using LFER and PaDEL descriptors, was 0.94 and 0.96, respectively. The Applicability Domain (AD) of the models was assessed and then the models were applied to a large number of chemical compounds with unknown values of adipose/blood partition coefficient. In conclusion, the proposed models were checked for fitting, validity and applicability. It was demonstrated that they are stable, reliable and capable to predict the values of adipose/blood partition coefficient of “data poor” chemical compounds that fall within the applicability domain.

AB  - Building safe and effective roundabouts requires optimizing traffic (operational) efficiency (TE) and traffic safety (TS) while taking into account geometric factors, traffic characteristics and local constraints. Most existing simulation-based optimization models do not simultaneously optimize all these factors. To capture the relationship among geometry, efficiency and safety, we put forward a model formulation in this paper. We present a new multi-criteria and simultaneous multi-objective optimization (MOO) model approach to optimize geometry, TE and TS of urban unsignalized single-lane roundabouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that uses the multi-criteria decision-making method known as analytic hierarchy process to evaluate and rank traffic parameters and geometric elements of urban single-lane roundabouts. The model was built based on comprehensive review of the research literature and existing roundabout simulation software, a field survey of 61 civil and traffic expert engineers in Croatia, and field studies of roundabouts in the Croatian capital city of Zagreb. We started from the basis of Kimber’s capacity model, HCM2010 serviceability model, and Maycock and Hall's accident prediction model, which we extended by adding sensitivity analysis and powerful MOO procedures of the bounded objective function method and interactive optimization. Preliminary validation of the model was achieved by identifying the optimal and most robust of three geometric alternatives (V.1-V.3) for an unsignalized single-lane roundabout in Zagreb, Croatia. The geometric parameters in variant V.1 had significantly higher values than in the existing design V.0, while approaches 1 and 3 in variant V.2 were enlarged as much as possible within allowed spatial limits and Croatian guidelines, reflecting their higher traffic demand. Sensitivity analysis indicated that variant V.2 showed the overall highest TE and TS across the entire range of traffic flow demand and pedestrian crossing flow demand at approaches. At the same time, the number of predicted traffic accidents was similar for all three variants, although it was lowest overall for V.2. The similarity in predicted accident frequency for the three variants suggests that V.2 provides the greatest safety within the predefined constraints and parameter ranges explored in our study. These preliminary results suggest that the proposed model can optimize geometry, TE and TS of urban single-lane roundabouts.

AB  - Bioenergy sources have been introduced as a means to address challenges of conventional energy sources. The uncertainties of supply-side (upstream) externalities (e.g., collection and logistics) represent the key challenges in bioenergy supply chains and lead to reduce cross-cutting sustainability benefits. We propose a mixed biomass-based energy supply chain (consisting of mixed-mode bio-refineries and mixed-pathway transportation) and a multi-criteria decision making framework to address the upstream challenges. Our developed framework supports decisions influencing the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Economic analysis employs a support vector machine technique, to predict the pattern of uncertainty parameters, and a stochastic optimization model, to incorporate uncertainties into the model. The stochastic model minimizes the total annual cost of the proposed mixed supply chain network by using a genetic algorithm. Environmental impact analysis employs life cycle assessment to evaluate the global warming potential of the cost-effective supply chain network. Our presented approach is capable of enhancing sustainability benefits of bioenergy industry infrastructure. A case study for the Pacific Northwest is used to demonstrate the application of the methodology and to verify the models. The results indicate that mixed supply chains can improve sustainability performance over traditional supply infrastructures by reducing costs (up to 24%) and environmental impacts (up to 5%).

AB  - Purpose
The paper proposes a decision support system for selecting logistics providers based on the quality function deployment (QFD) and the technique for order preference by the similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for agricultural supply chain in France. The research provides a platform for group decision making to facilitate decision process and check the consistency of the outcomes.
Methodology
The proposed model looks at the decision problem from two points of view considering both technical and customer perspectives. The main customer criteria are confidence in a safe and durable product, emission of pollutants and hazardous materials, social responsibility, etc. The main technical factors are financial stability, quality, delivery condition, services, etc. based on the literature review. The second stage in the adopted methodology is the combination of quality function deployment and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to effectively analyze the decision problem. In final section we structure a group decision system called GRoUp System (GRUS) which has been developed by Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT) in the Toulouse University.
Results
This paper designs a group decision making system to interface decision makers and customer values in order to aid agricultural partners and investors in the selection of third party logistic providers. Moreover, we have figured out a decision support system under fuzzy linguistic variables is able to assist agricultural parties in uncertain situations. This integrated and efficient decision support system enhances quality and reliability of the decision making.
Novelty/Originality
The novelty of this paper is reflected by several items. The integration of group multi-criteria decision tools enables decision makers to obtain a comprehensive understanding of customer needs and technical requirements of the logistic process. In addition, this investigation is carried out under a European commission project called Risk and Uncertain Conditions for Agriculture Production Systems (RUC-APS) which models risk reduction and elimination from the agricultural supply chain. Ultimately, we have implemented the decision support tool to select the best logistic provider among France logistics and transportation companies.

AB  - A general aggregation formalism for multi criteria decision making (MCDM) applications is presented. Using this formalism, we derive the existing aggregation operators, and also develop some new ones. The proposed general formalism is further extended to develop discriminative class of aggregation operators for aiding MCDM. The proposed discriminative aggregation operators are based on the consideration of the variability in the various evaluations of a criterion. Four families of discriminative aggregation operators are developed using the extended formalism. These operators and applied in a managerial real world case-study.

AB  - Ever increasing customer choices, environmental concerns and competitiveness among manufacturers across the globe has engaged the industry to embrace newer manufacturing strategies. Predominantly, there are three dimensions to modern manufacturing systems viz. economic, environmental and social. The integration of lean-green-agile manufacturing strategies would be a complete and comprehensive manufacturing system which is the need of the 21st century. The adoption of Lean-Green-Agile Manufacturing System (LGAMS) would be facilitated by few enablers. The influence of these enablers is a matter of investigation which is addressed by the present study. An attempt has been made to prioritize the facilitating capacity of each enabler. The outcome of the research would facilitate the policy makers in the industry and government to frame policies.

AB  - Acid-rain has evolved into a robust, diverse and dynamic spectra of studies in contemporary times. The significant role of rain water harvesting as a major source of water supply, especially in high harvesting potential regions like the Niger delta of Nigeria, the core area of oil exploratory activities and where gas flaring a major cause of acid rain is rife, prompts serious concerns. Unlike previous studies, this is a pioneer effort applicable in generalization, as it goes beyond considering other complimentary acid rain control options like nitrogen oxides (NOx), to capturing both social and institutional factors with crucial sustainability criteria solicited from expert interview into its modelling. It applies the unique and exemplary features of fuzzy TOPSIS to aid the selection of sustainable acid rain control options intrinsic to society, under economic, environmental, social, technical, and institutional factors. Linguistic scales were employs to solicit expert opinions, understanding acid rain dialogues as public policy issues saddled with numerous vagueness and complexity especially in achieving sustainability. Results from data aggregation, normalization and performance ratings, coupled with the weighted distance from the positive and negative ideal solutions indicated that solar as an alternative energy source ranked topmost while hydro and use of NOX burners ranked second and third respectively. The revelations are satisfactory logically and especially consistent with use of NOX burners ranking third, that Nigerian crude is sweet. Hence beyond the general clamor for total elimination of gas flaring, enforcing the use of pollution control devices like NOX burners and a shift to promoting investment in solar plants/energy is considered viable.

AB  - This work proposes a new criterion to validate and improve the classification efficiency of the Learning Algorithm Multivariable and Data Analysis (LAMDA) fuzzy algorithm, which is an algorithm that combines the concepts of neural networks architecture and fuzzy clustering. LAMDA is based on finding the Global Adequacy Degree (GAD) of one data (individual) to a class (functional state), considering the contributions of each descriptor or variable. LAMDA is capable of generating new classes after the training stage and it uses probability density functions (PDF) for the estimation of similarity analysis between classes in order to determine the grouping criterion. The LAMDA algorithm was used here to identify new functional states that were not included during the training stage. However, this algorithm induced significant uncertainties when the recognized classes, corresponding to engine operating modes, exhibited similar membership degree values (MDV). To solve this, a new criterion to validate functional states after recognition (LAMDA-FAR), based on the minimum and maximum distances among MDV was developed. Both LAMDA and LAMDA-FAR algorithms were used in supervised learning mode to classify a historical database obtained from an experimental mapping methodology of an automotive diesel engine operating under several steady state conditions. For each engine operating mode the engine speed (rpm), exhaust gas temperature (°C) and accelerator pedal position (%) were measured as the representative variables to carry out the classification. Both algorithms were trained with 70% of the historical database. The remaining 30% of the data, as well as new engine operating modes (not taken into account during the training stage), were used to validate classifier results. It was found that the LAMDA algorithm alone was unable to properly classify similar engine operating modes, while the LAMDA-FAR algorithm showed 100% efficiency for both known and unknown operating modes. This high efficiency and low computational cost tool can be used to improve engine control strategies based on experimental mapping methods, as well as to monitoring and controlling on-line vehicle performance.
