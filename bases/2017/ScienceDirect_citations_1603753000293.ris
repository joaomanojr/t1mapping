AB  - Aspects of sustainability – understood as the ability to manage economic, social and environmental performance at the same time – are becoming more important in Supply Chain Management. This is a challenge as sustainability adds less quantifiable aspects to Supply Chain Management than classic process aspects. On the other side measuring sustainability is crucial for the implementation of modern Supply Chains Management and to manage sustainably in the daily business. This contribution discusses the integration of sustainability in performance measurement and management systems (PMMS) for Supply Chain Management. Therefore in the paper firstly an overview of definitions and developments in performance measurement and management systems and a structure for PMMS are given. Secondly guidelines for good and modern PMMS are discussed. Thirdly existing approaches for Supply Chain Management PMMS (e. g. KPIs, TCO, value driver trees and balanced scorecards and maturity assessments) are presented and the suitability for Supply Chain Management as well as the possibility to integrate aspects of sustainability are examined. Lastly the fulfilment of the requirements and the ability to cope with the challenges of the approaches is discussed.

AB  - Landslides in mountainous areas render major damages to residential areas, roads, and farmlands. Hence, one of the basic measures to reduce the possible damage is by identifying landslide-prone areas through landslide mapping by different models and methods. The purpose of conducting this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of two models of the analytical network process (ANP) and fuzzy logic in landslide risk mapping in the Azarshahr Chay basin in northwest Iran. After field investigations and a review of research literature, factors affecting the occurrence of landslides including slope, slope aspect, altitude, lithology, land use, vegetation density, rainfall, distance to fault, distance to roads, distance to rivers, along with a map of the distribution of occurred landslides were prepared in GIS environment. Then, fuzzy logic was used for weighting sub-criteria, and the ANP was applied to weight the criteria. Next, they were integrated based on GIS spatial analysis methods and the landslide risk map was produced. Evaluating the results of this study by using receiver operating characteristic curves shows that the hybrid model designed by areas under the curve 0.815 has good accuracy. Also, according to the prepared map, a total of 23.22% of the area, amounting to 105.38 km2, is in the high and very high-risk class. Results of this research are great of importance for regional planning tasks and the landslide prediction map can be used for spatial planning tasks and for the mitigation of future hazards in the study area.

AB  - Design alternative evaluation in the early stages of engineering design plays an important role in determining the success of new product development, as it influences considerably the subsequent design activities. However, existing approaches to design alternative evaluation are overly reliant on experts’ ambiguous and subjective judgments and qualitative descriptions. To reduce subjectivity and improve efficiency of the evaluation process, this paper proposes a quantitative evaluation approach through data-driven performance predictions. In this approach, the weights of performance characteristics are determined based on quantitative assessment of expert judgments, and the ranking of design alternatives is achieved by predicting performance values based on historical product design data. The experts’ subjective and often vague judgments are captured quantitatively through a rough number based Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. In order to facilitate performance based quantitative ranking of alternatives at the early stages of design where no performance calculation is possible, a particle swarm optimization based support vector machine (PSO-SVM) is applied for historical data based performance prediction. The final ranking of alternatives given the predicted values of multiple performance characteristics is achieved through Višekriterijumska Optimizacija I kompromisno Rešenje (VIKOR). A case study is carried out to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.

AB  - Excessive use of fossil fuels leads to numerous environmental problems in human life. These problems encompass the growth in greenhouse gases, global warming, and deterioration of air quality, climate change, oil spills, and acid rain. Accordingly, renewable energy sources have become more attractive since they do not produce such pollution and negative effects compared to fossil fuels. In this study, the bioenergy resources in Kurdistan province, Iran are assessed and the bioenergy map is developed. Bioenergy power potentials of Kurdistan province have been estimated to be approximately 4millionMWhper year. This amount of power can be compared with 450MW thermal power plants. The biomass production capacity in Kurdistan can also be compared with the combined cycle power plant in Sanandaj. The results of these comparisons indicate the enormous potentials of biomass resources that have been neglected in Kurdistan thus far. In the present work, we are studying different sources of bioenergy, including agricultural residues, wood residues, livestock waste, sewage, and municipal wastes. In each category, the existing data and information are employed, and a suitable method is applied to estimate the amount of bioenergy obtained. Our findings reveal that agricultural crop residues can play a major role in energy production from bioenergy resources in the cities with agriculture capacity such as Bijar, Divandarreh, and Qorveh. In highly populated cities in Kurdistan, including Sanandaj and Saqqez, municipal sewage and waste are two important bioenergy sources.

AB  - Solar energy is the most promising resource as it plays a vital role in economic growth, improvement in quality of life and achievement of sustainable future of a nation. The objective of the present study is to conduct the Strength-Weakness-Opportunity-Challenges (SWOC) analysis of solar energy deployment in Indian context. Moreover, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique is utilized to obtain priority of the SWOC variables in deployment of solar energy. The hybrid combination of AHP with SWOC analysis produces analytically determined priorities for the factors and makes them commensurable. Finally, sensitivity analysis has been used to investigate SWOC variables’ rank stability. Among SWOC variables, opportunity factor emerged out to be the most dominant which concludes that deploying solar energy can provide several chances to grow for a nation sustainably. Moreover, weakness associated with solar energy reaches to bottom place which shows bright future of diffusion of solar energy. Present study will assist policy planners, and concerned authorities to understand the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges of solar energy in order to plan, manage and develop it effectively to attain sustainability.

AB  - A new comprehensive approach is proposed to support cost-optimal design of building envelope’s thermal characteristics and HVAC (heating, ventilating and air-conditioning) systems in presence of a simulation-based model predictive control (MPC) for heating and cooling operations. The cost-optimal solution is identified through a main mono-objective genetic algorithm (GA) that minimizes global costs for space conditioning. The explored solutions represent building thermal designs integrated with the MPC of HVAC systems. For defining the MPC strategies, the main GA launches two secondary bi-objective GAs that optimize heating and cooling operations, respectively. These secondary GAs perform Pareto optimizations by minimizing operating costs and thermal discomfort. They provide the optimal hourly set point temperatures for heating and cooling operations, with a day-ahead planning horizon, by considering the forecasts of weather conditions and building use. The optimal control strategies are found based on requirements of users, who set a minimum comfort level to be fulfilled. The GAs are implemented by coupling MATLAB® with EnergyPlus. The methodology is applied to a new multi-zone residential building in Naples (Southern Italy). It yields primary energy savings around 35.4kWh/m2a and global cost savings around 7000€, ensuring the same satisfying comfort level, compared to a standard design approach.

AB  - Cities have become important drivers in promoting strategies for sustainable development. The primary objective of this article is to analyze the differences between public transportation in Newcastle upon Tyne, the city considered the most sustainable in the United Kingdom, and Florianópolis, a city with great potential for sustainable policies located in southern Brazil. This comparison may provide models, ideas and actions for the development of Florianópolis as a model of sustainability in South America. Therefore, a comparative analysis is provided: to observe changes, build models, and verify similarities and differences, while seeking to discover which behaviors govern political and social phenomena in the area of urban sustainability. This paper provides a comparative description of social and economic indicators: gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, inflation, employment, as well as the historical population evolution of the two cities. This work contrasts the sustainable transport model used by Newcastle and the reality of the transport needs of Florianópolis. This article is the first in a series to analyze the indicators for sustainable cities, focusing mainly on the reality of the South American city.

AB  - Investing in renewable energy production is a high interest venture considering global energy needs and the environmental impact of fossil fuel consumption. Motivated by the goals set by the European Union towards 2020, this study aims at designing a renewable energy map (installing solar power plants) in Greece. Three aspects are considered, namely, social, financial, and power production aspects. A goal programming model is developed under target and structural constraints, and all possible weight combinations are examined. The solutions derived from each iteration are subjected to a financial meta-analysis, considering different tax and return scenarios aligned to the Greek taxation and banking system. The analysis considers Greece and each region separately, taking net present value (NPV) as an objective measure to assess the solutions. From the results, it is concluded that the internal rate of return is approximately 22.5%−25% for the overall network. In addition, higher NPV values are obtained when the financial and power production aspects are given greater emphasis. The proposed model provides multi-dimensional information for decision makers; investors can determine the optimal budgeting mix, and policy makers can determine the weight on each aspect that guarantees the success of the venture.

AB  - There exist two main types of uncertainty for an intuitionistic reciprocal preference relation (IRPR). One is inconsistency among pairwise intuitionistic judgments, and the other is vagueness and incompleteness of judgments. It is important to capture and control uncertainty or hesitancy of the obtained results for evaluating missing values of incomplete IRPRs. In this paper, we put forward geometric consistency of incomplete IRPRs. A two-stage procedure comprising two goal programming models is developed to evaluate missing values of an incomplete IRPR. The first goal programming model is devised to minimize the inconsistency level of the resulting complete IRPR and control ratio-based hesitation indices of the evaluated intuitionistic judgments within a given acceptable threshold. The second goal programming model aims to seek the most fitting evaluation values in the sense of maintaining the inconsistency level derived by the first model. By applying the developed evaluation model and introducing a weighted AND-like representable Cross Ratio uninorm-based aggregation method, a procedure is then presented for solving group decision making problems with incomplete IRPRs. Three numerical examples including a comparative study are examined to illustrate the advantage and applicability of the developed framework.

AB  - There is incomplete knowledge about seismic vulnerability assessment of residential buildings due to the complexity and multiplicity of effective parameters. The lack of an integrated model with all effective parameters for such assessment limits the possibility of policy-making and decision-making toward earthquake risk mitigation and disaster risk reduction. This paper is a response to this need and proposes an integrated model for the seismic vulnerability assessment of residential buildings based on the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in geographic information system (GIS). The methodology integrates five main group-parameters -- geotechnical and seismological, social, distance to dangerous facilities, and access to vital facilities -- with their related sub-parameters. To evaluate the practicability and applicability of the newly developed model, it was used for Mahabad city, Iran. The obtained vulnerabilities for the city were mapped in GIS and the same were visualized in the 3D city model for residential buildings. The developed model can be considered as a significant tool to confront crises resulting from future earthquakes.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to evaluate the best mode of transport in relation to the transport quality perceived by users. To this aim, we have found a framework to aggregate data and information coming from multiple information sources, often characterized by a high level of uncertainty. The proposed method is a hybrid approach based on two different theories: the Analytical Hierarchy Process (Saaty, 1980) and the Evidence- or Dempster-Shafer-Theory(Dempster 1967; 1968; Shafer, 1976). First, we have carried out a survey to investigate the users’ point of view about the quality of transport, expressed through fifteen criteria, representative of the transport quality. Within the survey, the users were asked to rank the chosen criteria. Due to the complexity of the transport problem, we have used the Analytical Hierarchy Process to decompose the problem in different levels. Because of the decomposition, we have obtained priority vectors, which we have taken as basic probability assignments for application of the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). The DST is used to fuse different users’ opinions and to take into account Uncertainty embedded in human judgment. The results show which alternatives users consider the best in relation to analyzed criteria.

AB  - Similar to other modelling methodologies, the potential of system dynamics to contribute to system understanding and decision making depends upon the practices applied by the modeller. However lessons about many of these practices are often unreported. This paper contributes to the methodology of system dynamics modelling of socio-ecological systems by 1) examining issues modellers face during the modelling process, and 2) providing guidance on how to effectively design and implement system dynamics modelling. This is achieved through an investigation of five case studies, drawing on lessons from these experiences. This is complemented by a literature review of system dynamics applied within the context of integrated modelling and environmental DSS. The case studies cover a variety of environmental issues and system dynamics modelling methods and tools. Although we used system dynamics as the common lens from which lessons are drawn, many of these insights transcend to other integrated modelling approaches.

AB  - Flight safety cannot be compromised. Thus, commercial airlines should constantly develop safety management strategies to mitigate the diverse hazardous factors in flight operations. Given the constraint of organizational resource, a commercial airline may not have sufficient resources to implement all the necessary strategies simultaneously. This study uses a well-structured process to develop a qualitative evaluation model that will enable airlines to identify human errors and select an intervention strategy with the highest success potential. To clarify the decision problem, the Human Factors Intervention Matrix framework is utilized to construct the decision hierarchy. The Analytic Hierarchy Process is then used to attain the priorities of potential alternative strategies for various unsafe acts. Finally, Zero-One Goal Programming models are formulated to select an optimal portfolio based on the specific target and the available organizational resources. An empirical study is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed model. According to the results of the combined model, an optimal portfolio, including the intervention approaches of organizational/administrative, human/crew, and operational/physical environment, can remediate four unsafe acts, namely, decision errors, skill-based errors, perceptual errors, and violations, under resource constraints of the organization.

This model is used to investigate whether technical efficiency causes flight punctuality or the other way around. The model, however, yields a non-trivial likelihood function and is not amenable to estimation using least squares or standard maximum likelihood techniques. To estimate the model therefore, we propose and implement maximum simulated likelihood with importance sampling. The results suggest a mutual dependence (feedback) between technical efficiency and delays. Policy implications are derived.

AB  - Facility location is a problem of paramount importance and optimizing business operations without affecting customer service is very challenging. In the case of banking services, the location of bank branches and ATMs must match the service demands (turn around time for service, reachability etc) of the customers’ and the expected quality of service is determined by the socio-economic background of the customer. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate the optimization problem so as to reflect the customers’ expectations and tolerance for quality of service in a given geographical region. The ability to do so requires clustering people living in the region into several smaller areas called service areas. An ideal clustering algorithm should consider the social behavior of people living in the service area and the uncertainty associated with their social behavior. In this paper, we propose a modification to generalized density based clustering algorithm (GDBSCAN) to deal with fuzziness in the values describing the population demographics and the preferences for ATM location among customers utilizing the ATM services. The modified version of GDBSCAN clustering algorithm, which we call GFDBSCAN, is used to cluster people around key socio-economic parameters. GFDBSCAN can also be used to cluster geographical regions based on the requirement and preferences expressed by the customers for services like business outlets, ATMs, bank branch operations, public utilities, etc. We apply the proposed algorithm to cluster geo-spatial data based on personal traits of people living in the geographical area under study. We measure and compare the performance of GFDBSCAN with other popular clustering algorithms using Silhouette coefficient, Dunn index and Davies–Bouldin index. We plot the clustering results on Google maps for better visualization of results. We found that GFDBSCAN is better able to cope with fuzziness in the values of both spatial and non-spatial attributes. We finally use voronoi diagrams to identify the ideal locations to place ATMs so as to ensure that the customers’ preferences are served and, at the same time, the service area of each ATM is optimized.

Firstly, we put forward a basic model for assessing supply chain enterprise credit risk by splitting overall credit risk into spontaneous and contagious credit risk. Secondly, after constructing an evaluation indicator system for supply chain enterprises, we determine spontaneous credit risk by employing fuzzy preference relations. Thirdly, we establish a risk numerical matrix to measure contagious credit risk based on spontaneous credit risk and analyze its cumulative effect using a matrix analysis. Finally, a real-world case study is presented to illustrate how the proposed model can be applied to assess supply chain enterprise credit risk.

AB  - Forced by competitive, legislative and customers' pressures, corporate executives are supposed to consider sustainability aspects of value creation which induces a new set of challenges within decision-making. Unfortunately, guidelines supporting comprehensive analysis, especially concerning the evaluation of environmental and social performance of decision alternatives, are missing. This hinders the advancements in corporate sustainability. Questions arise on how to measure and balance respective indicators with traditional economic objectives. To fill this void, this research sets out to develop an intuitive and holistic planning framework for advancing sustainability along supply chains. In a first step, we identify sustainability issues and indicators as well as decision-support methods by scrutinizing literature on sustainable supply chain management. Based on this, we develop a planning framework that supports executives in evaluating and deciding upon corporate sustainability initiatives. The framework comprises three consecutive phases of planning: ‘Problem definition’, ‘Assessment of alternatives’, and ‘Decision analysis’. For each phase we propose appropriate tools distinguishing concepts of sustainable supply chain management (e.g. Sustainable Logistics and Sustainable Manufacturing), methods for measuring the ecological and social efficiency of decision alternatives, and quantitative decision-support techniques able to balance trade-offs between the three dimensions of the triple bottom line. As a result, this article presents a framework for guiding corporate decision-processes. From the academic angle, the article contributes to the research field by providing a structured integration of concepts and methods utilizable in the pursuit of ecological and social improvements along the value chain.

AB  - Many-objective Optimization Problems (MaOPs) present various challenges to the current optimization methods. Among these, the visualization gap is an important obstacle to the interpretation of results. Having the ability of visualizing partial or final results of a high-dimensional multi-objective problem provides key advantages to the optimizer and also to the decision-maker in terms of understanding the problem and interpreting results. In this article, a multi-purposed visualization tool is proposed to be applied in an evolutionary design process. The proposed visualization tool follows the circular design layout, mapping the solutions from high-dimensional objective space into a 2D form of scattering that is based on norm and angle information. Meanwhile, it preserves some desirable characteristics of objective space, such as the shape of the Pareto front, its location, relations between objectives etc. With the support of this tool the decision-maker can obtain information about the shape of the Pareto front, the range of explored area by the algorithms, qualitative estimation of algorithm performance, relation between objectives, location of solutions and their dispersion. Furthermore, this application has scalability and flexibility about the number of objectives and population size. Finally, the proposed mapping allows the decision-maker to visually identify poorly explored regions of the objective space and determine weight vectors to guide the search to a specific or preferred region. The case studies in the experimental results show that this tool can play a role in the design process and help the evolutionary solving process.

KW  - Knee point driven evolutionary algorithm
AB  - Cloud computing is able to deliver large amount of computing resources on demand, and it has become one of the most effective ways to implement large-scale computationally intensive applications. In a cloud computing environment, applications typically involve workflows. Therefore, optimized workflow scheduling can greatly improve the overall performance of cloud computing. However, existing studies on cloud workflow scheduling usually consider at most three objectives only and effective methods to solve scheduling problems with four or more objectives still lack. To address the above issue, a new cloud workflow scheduling model is formulated that simultaneously considers four objectives, namely, minimization of makespan, minimization of the average execution time of all workflow instances, maximization of reliability, and minimization of the cost of workflow execution. To solve this four-objective scheduling problem, an improved knee point driven evolutionary algorithm is proposed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the improved algorithm outperforms existing popular many-objective evolutionary algorithms in most experimental scenarios studied in this work, in particular when there is sufficiently large amount of computing resource supply and the time for scheduling is limited.

The main objective is to maximize the annual energy savings, expressed in Euros, while minimizing the initial investment expressed also in Euros, considering the retrofit strategies as decisions variables and evaluating their effect in the usage of space heating and cooling and costs, depending on the chosen technology. A multi-objective genetic algorithm coded in MATLAB© to solve the optimization problem. Different energy efficiency measures are considered, such as the improvement of U-values in external walls and windows through the application of insulation materials, the change of lighting fixtures and refrigerator model to reduce the electricity consumption, and the usage of PV panels for self-consumption, and the use of Heat Pumps for space heating and cooling. The fitness function is subjected to different constraints related with the fulfillment of the demand, the physical limitation of household space, the capacity to comply with the heating and cooling needs, and the non-negativity nature of the variables. The best set of retrofitting options are presented, the budget to implement them and the amount of achieved energy savings.

AB  - Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) is the most preferred displacement measurement transducer used in industries because of its simple design and proven reliability. The major challenge faced in LVDT is linearity in limited stroke range. In this paper, a fractional order model of LVDT is developed and its characteristics like sensitivity, nonlinearity and stroke range are analysed by considering fractional behaviour only in self-inductance, mutual inductance and both. The results presented in this paper shows that Fractional Order Linear Variable Differential Transformer (FOLVDT) provides high sensitivity with reduced nonlinearity compared to the conventional LVDT. The results also demonstrate that the FOLVDT can be operated for increased stroke range without compromising on sensitivity and linearity.

AB  - The climate evolution towards a progressive increase of Earth's temperature is leading to many worrying consequences, involving different aspects of World life. Among them, a specific focus should be given to the resilience of building energy design to global warming, since the efficiency and effectiveness of energy conservation measures over time can be highly affected by climate change. In this vein, the paper applies a multi-stage, multi-objective approach to find robust cost-optimal energy retrofit solutions and to assess their resilience to global warming. The approach combines the software EnergyPlus and MATLAB® to implement an optimization genetic algorithm and a smart research strategy. This framework allows to explore a huge solution domain by investigating sundry performance indicators, such as energy needs, polluting emissions and global costs, thereby ensuring a robust assessment of cost-optimality. Different cost-optimal retrofit solutions are found for different global warming and economic scenarios. Finally, a careful decision-making is performed to identify a recommended solution that provides the highest resilience to the cited scenarios, yielding the best trade-off among energy, environmental and economic performances. The approach is applied to a typical Mediterranean building, located in South Italy. The recommended solution includes the energy retrofit of the whole building envelope and the replacement of energy systems. It requires an investment around 100€/m2 and, in most scenarios, produces high potential benefits in terms of primary energy savings (42÷44kWh/m2a), polluting emission reductions (11.5÷12.0kgCO2-eq/m2a) and global cost savings (5÷78€/m2).

AB  - The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology supports companies to optimize business processes and reduce operational costs by knowing an item’s condition and location in the inventory. RFID applications expand on the basis of speed, security and correct information flow; however, selecting the most suitable RFID service provider presents a challenge. This article offers an integrated multi-criteria evaluation framework for selecting the most suitable RFID service provider by applying Fuzzy Axiomatic Design (Fuzzy AD) and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP) techniques with Group Decision Making (GDM) approach. A case study is conducted and the results are discussed through a sensitivity analysis and a comparative evaluation with fuzzy TOPSIS. It is observed that an alternative RFID service provider that does not meet the defined Functional Requirements (FRs) is directly eliminated by Fuzzy AD, whereas fuzzy TOPSIS ranks it as an eligible one. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that if FRs are low enough, the outcome of Fuzzy AD and fuzzy TOPSIS do converge, underlining the goal-oriented advantage of Fuzzy AD. The paper contributes to literature by presenting a novel approach for incorporating subjective and often conflicting linguistic evaluations of a decision committee into a solid decision support model approach for selecting the most suitable RFID service provider.

AB  - An important strategy to promote a strong sustainable growth relies on an efficient municipal waste management, and phasing out waste landfilling through waste prevention and recycling emerges as a major target. For this purpose, effective collection schemes are required, in particular those regarding selective waste collection, pursuing a more efficient and high quality recycling of reusable materials. This paper addresses the assessment and benchmarking of selective collection schemes, relevant to guide future operational improvements. In particular, the assessment is based on the monitoring and statistical analysis of a core-set of performance indicators that highlights collection trends, complemented with a performance index that gathers a weighted linear combination of these indicators. This combined analysis underlines a potential tool to support decision makers involved in the process of selecting the collection scheme with best overall performance. The presented approach was applied to a case study conducted in Oporto Municipality, with data gathered from two distinct selective collection schemes.

KW  - Sanjiangyuan region
AB  - Sanjiangyuan region, which located in the north of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China, is characterized by an extreme environment and is subject to the impacts of climate change and intense human activities. To protect the eco-environment in Sanjiangyuan, the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve (SNNR) was established in 2000, and an ecological project was initiated in 2005. Comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of the eco-environmental vulnerability (EV) and analysis of the long-term dynamic changes in the region are extremely important for understanding eco-environmental change and assessing protection effectiveness, however rarely found in previous research. The aim of this study is to develop a method to assess EV and analyse the dynamic change in Sanjiangyuan region for years 1990, 2000 and 2010. In the first phase of the study, an integrated evaluation method based on Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) was developed. This phases included: ■development of the evaluation hierarchical structure and selection criteria;■data collection and processing;■evaluation criteria normalization;■determination of the related importance of the criteria;■criteria weighting calculation, and;■linear weighted combination. In the second phase of the study, the developed methodology was applied to assess the EV in the Sanjiangyuan region for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010, and to document the dynamic change. In the third phase, a series of integrated regional EV grades were used to analyse the EV change both within and outside of SNNR. The results showed that: 1) EV in the whole Sanjiangyuan region was distributed as a high/low gradient that trends west to east in all three study periods; 2) the dynamic change of EV in Sanjiangyuan region as a whole showed a moderate reduction during 1990–2000, a sizeable and extensive decrease during 2000–2010; and, 3) during the 2000–2010 period, ecological environment change magnitude was significantly better within the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve than for the unprotected areas of the region. The proposed method is relatively easy to implement and could also be applied to other study regions. However, the method could be further improved by reducing some subjective elements.

AB  - Construction trades need to share temporary structures to increase the output of direct work while controlling the labor input of indirect work. The purpose of this research is to develop a framework to determine the optimal location of temporary structures in a computerized practical manner for piping construction projects. Based on the spatial relationship between work envelope and scaffolding placement requirements, this paper presents the optimization model in two phases: the simulation-based optimization model and a multi-attribute utility (MAU) based alternative selection model. A multi-objective optimization model is established to improve scaffolding availability among multiple activities while maximizing piping crew productivity. The multi-attribute utility model is employed to handle the uncertainty of the assessment weights on the attributes to illustrate the preference of decision makers among different scaffolding placement alternatives obtained from the first phase. The approach was validated in a piping module, which provided superintendents and space planners with an effective decision-making tool among possible scaffolding alternatives in piping construction. The proposed optimization technique is an alternative methodology for solving the productivity-tasks-scaffolding trade-off problem, which further revolutionizes the spatial coordination process of workspace management and temporary structure planning.

AB  - Today, customer centricity becomes the key success factor for the manufacturing companies in gaining sustainable competitive advantage. In this regard, they need advanced production planning and control (PPC) techniques to be more customer focused. This study aims to integrate customer relationship management (CRM) and PPC approaches in order to use manufacturing resources of job shops more effectively in satisfying customers. To this aim, a simulated annealing based simulation optimization approach is proposed. To confirm the viability of the proposed approach, it is applied to a realistic job shop system. In order to accelerate the flow of production, product type based lot splitting is applied. In the scheduling phase, dynamic scheduling is implemented by machine-based dispatching rules. Multiple customer segments with different importance weights, and their expectations and penalties on order completion rate on due date, tardiness and earliness are considered. The aim of the proposed approach is to make near optimal policy decisions regarding the machine-based dispatching rules and number of equal sublots for the products. In this regard, four well-known dispatching rules and five modified versions of these rules which are proposed in this study are employed. Computational experiments are performed by using different dominance relationships between the customer segments, inter-arrival times and level of due date allowance factor. Results of the experiments reveal that integration of CRM and PPC approaches in job shop systems provides more effective use of resources in satisfying customers, and that the proposed approach can easily be implemented in practice.

AB  - The Bhopal pesticide accidenttriggered a number of responses from the companies involved from the Indian government as well as reforms in the United States. These initiatives reached a range of different conclusions that arguably failed to provide a coherent framework for action around the globe. In other domains, organisations such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), provide a common point of reference for the many different investigations that may be conducted in the aftermath of an accident. The early origin of the international aircraft safety investigation process can be traced back more than 70years and has developed in the course of time to be useful in improving aviation safety. Despite these practices can’t applied directly to other industry they may help to develop good practices. Even today, the international chemical industry lacks international guidelines for safety investigations. There are, however, initiatives to support investigations within individual nations.Without greater consistency, we argue that there is littleprospectof ensuringinternationalcooperationin mitigating the consequences or reducing the likelihood of future accidents across increasingly globalizedchemicalindustries. This contribution elaborates on the engines for change, taking into account system inherent properties and safety management concepts that serve as barriers for implementation. Such barriers are of a methodological nature, originating from differences in goals and perspectives between accident investigation in aviation and risk management strategies in nuclear and chemical industries. We also identify opportunities to overcome these barriers through the exchange of good practice across these industries.

Addressing the elusive nature of urban planning and its need to cope with more technical sectors, the framework allows urban planners to generate and evaluate many alternative urban configurations, while focusing their attention on the most promising ones. First, addressing the need for integrated urban modeling approaches, a Mixed Integer Linear Programing (MILP) optimization model representing both urban and energy system components was developed. Second, an interface based on parallel coordinates and georeferenced maps is proposed to effectively communicate the optimization results to decision makers, revealing tradeoffs and synergies between competing objectives. Interaction with the parallel coordinates charts further allows planners to steer consecutive optimization runs based on their preferences and experience. The framework is applied to an urban development project in Switzerland to demonstrate its usability and relevance.

For this, we consider both technology and market characteristics in providing competitor intelligence by utilizing patent data as a representative proxy for a firm's technology, and trademark data as an information source for the firm's target goods and services. To analyze the two types of data, a collaborative filtering approach together with portfolio analyses and association mining techniques were adopted. Theoretically, this is one of the earliest attempts to combine patent data and trademark data to investigate corporate strategies. In practice, the research results are expected to be used as a decision criterion to diagnose the economic value that companies can obtain by entering the market, as well as the technological value to be passed onto their customers. Thus, the proposed approach can be useful to support effective technology and business strategies in a firm.

AB  - In recent years there has been increased consumer use of the vast array of online reviews. Given the increasingly high volume of such reviews, automatic analyses of their quality have become imperative. Not surprisingly, this situation has attracted the interest of researchers. However, prior approaches are insufficient to address the consumers' need for non-burdensome sense making of online reviews. This research attempts to close this gap by proposing novel design science artifacts (i.e. construct, architecture, algorithms and prototype) to address the consumers' need. We evaluate these artifacts using a set of experiments and hypothesis tests. The results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed artifacts. We demonstrate their practical utility and relevance using real world pilot experiments. This paper contributes theoretical knowledge to the review quality literature and, what we believe is the first exemplifier for adequately validating the solutions of review quality research.

AB  - Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) is an important issue for organizations that spend considerable amounts of investments on personnel training annually. Although these investments present positive effects, the manner to assess the effectiveness of the training is unclear. Training, whose characteristics are intangible, is sometimes difficult to be assessed. This research has carried out a multi-criteria training assessment for GSCM through the four top-level processes of Supply Chain Operations Reference Model (SCOR) i.e., Plan, Source, Make and Deliver. Analytic Hierarchy Process was applied in the training assessment. In the chemical industry where our study was performed, the SCOR top-level processes were considered criteria, whereas Individual and Organizational Benefits alternatives. The modeling considered pairwise judgments for criteria, and ratings or absolute measure for alternatives. The analysis revealed that training essentially contributes to the organization, resulting in 87% for Organizational Benefits, and 77% for Individual Benefits. Organizational Benefits focused on the use of the best practices in GSCM and on the common understanding of vocabulary and processes. In addition, Individual Benefits increased knowledge and skills in GSCM. This result, presented to managers of the company, was validated as consistent and feasible.

AB  - The methods applied in the attempt to minimize electricity consumption waste as result of consumer's consumption patterns is of crucial concern for government, investors and even consumers. There is a need to identify the potential factors influencing electricity consumption pattern in order to encourage sustainable practices. To examine the electricity consumption pattern and their influencing factors, this study applied Fuzzy-DEMATEL model to examine the sustainable lifestyle factors of electricity consumption pattern in Nigeria. The originality of this paper lies in the proposed approach that integrates fuzzy logic and DEMATEL to evaluate sustainable lifestyles factors that influence industries electric consumption patterns for the first time in Nigeria. Firstly, 24 sustainable lifestyle factors were sourced from literature sources and grouped into 4 clusters of economic, political, environmental and socio-cultural criteria. Two sets of questionnaires were distributed to 30 experts who comprise of managers and senior technicians in Nigerian Power Industry. The results show that the critical factors which influence industries electric consumption patterns are corruption, inadequate planning and design, electricity theft, literacy level, population demography and lifestyle attitude. The implication for decision makers is that in improving power consumption pattern in the Nigerian industries; emphasis should be placed on the critical sustainable lifestyle factors. Thus, corruption should be minimized, planning and design adequately implemented, theft of electricity curbed while improving literacy level and lifestyles of the masses to improve electric consumption patterns.

AB  - This paper proposes a sampling-based method (SBM) for planning minimum dose path navigation for workers in nuclear facilities. To simulate and avoid obstacles, they were approximated by a combination of basic geometries and detected with the aid of virtual reality. To obtain an optimized walking path with minimum dose without considering the pre-designed road networks, a sampling-based method that utilizes the rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT*) algorithm, applicable in both continuous and discrete radiation fields, was proposed and implemented. The performance of this method was evaluated by simulating walk paths and estimating their radiation dose rates in a hypothetical nuclear facility, and the simulation results were compared with those derived from Dijsktra's algorithm under various radioactive environments.

AB  - In 1994, through classic control theory, John, Naim and Towill developed the ‘Automatic Pipeline, Inventory and Order-based Production Control System’ (APIOBPCS) which extended the original IOBPCS archetype developed by Towill in 1982 ─ well-recognised as a base framework for a production planning and control system. Due to the prevalence of the two original models in the last three decades in the academic and industrial communities, this paper aims to systematically review how the IOBPCS archetypes have been adopted, exploited and adapted to study the dynamics of individual production planning and control systems and whole supply chains. Using various databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar (113 papers), we found that the IOBPCS archetypes have been studied regarding the a) modification of four inherent policies related to forecasting, inventory, lead-time and pipeline to create a ‘family’ of models, b) adoption of the IOBPCS ‘family’ to reduce supply chain dynamics, and in particular bullwhip, c) extension of the IOBPCS family to represent different supply chain scenarios such as order-book based production control and closed-loop processes. Simulation is the most popular method adopted by researchers and the number of works based on discrete time based methods is greater than those utilising continuous time approaches. Most studies are conceptual with limited practical applications described. Future research needs to focus on cost, flexibility and sustainability in the context of supply chain dynamics and, although there are a few existing studies, more analytical approaches are required to gain robust insights into the influence of nonlinear elements on supply chain behaviour. Also, empirical exploitation of the existing models is recommended.

AB  - Indoor Location Based Services (LBS), such as indoor navigation and tracking, still have to deal with both technical and non-technical challenges. For this reason, they have not yet found a prominent position in people’s everyday lives. Reliability and availability of indoor positioning technologies, the availability of up-to-date indoor maps, and privacy concerns associated with location data are some of the biggest challenges to their development. If these challenges were solved, or at least minimized, there would be more penetration into the user market. This paper studies the requirements of LBS applications, through a survey conducted by the authors, identifies the current challenges of indoor LBS, and reviews the available solutions that address the most important challenge, that of providing seamless indoor/outdoor positioning. The paper also looks at the potential of emerging solutions and the technologies that may help to handle this challenge.

AB  - Coal as the basic energy in China plays a pivotal role in supporting national economic development and protecting national energy safety. The sustainable development of China's coal industry is still a hot topic both in practice and research. In terms of the lack of theoretical researches and practical applications of scientific coal mining evaluation, we built an evaluating system to assess the current development activities of coal enterprises. In the present work, to evaluate the scientific basis for coal mining systematically, effectively and objectively, the key indexes for assessing the level of scientific mining of coal resources were established using the document analysis method and the expert consultation method. The evaluating system consisting of 5 dimensions (informatization, productivity, safe mining, full cost and green mining), 18 criteria, and 56 assessment factors was constructed. Then, the weight values at all levels in the evaluating system were calculated using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Finally, an evaluating model for scientific mining could be constructed based on the comprehensive index assessment method. The application of this evaluating system of scientific mining could be used for finding the existing problems in the coal production process. Therefore, the coal enterprise managers and the government regulators could make the appropriate policies to enhance the scientific exploitation level of coal mines.

AB  - The choice of fuel for cooking, particularly in rural areas, can lead to significant socio-economic and environmental impacts amongst households. Using the Logone Valley on the border between Chad and Cameroon as the case study region, this study sought to evaluate appropriate cooking technologies for the case study region. Several alternatives to traditional three-stone fire were evaluated, including the: ceramic stove, Centrafricain stove, parabolic solar cooker, biodigester, LPG stove, and mlc rice husk stove. Four main clusters were investigated, structuring quantifiable indicators for financial, environmental, social and health related impacts of the use of a certain energy technology. The findings suggest that the Centrafricain stove alone or in combination with the mlc stove, was the most appropriate cooking technology for use in the case study region. These technologies were more appropriate than the traditional cooking system of the three stone fire. The use of four clusters of criteria, within a weighted system, coupled with the views of users, experts and literature, as well as the scope of the criteria employed enabled a reliable and valid approach to understanding the most appropriate cooking technology to recommend.

AB  - This paper presents an experimental investigation and control optimization of a ground source heat pump (GSHP) system. A set of experimental tests was first carried out to examine the performance of the GSHP system under different ground loop differential pressure set-points and different configurations of the ground heat exchangers (GHEs). A model-based optimization strategy was then developed to determine the optimal operating speed of the variable speed pumps in the ground loop system, in which a hybrid optimization technique integrating a performance map-based near-optimal strategy and the exhaustive search method was used to search for the optimal solutions of the optimization problem. The results from the experiments showed that, for the GSHP tested, the coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat pump units increased while that of the whole GSHP system decreased with the increase of the ground loop differential pressure set-point. The GSHP system with GHEs in the parallel operation outperformed that in the series operation. Using the proposed model-based strategy, energy savings of 8.0% during the heating period, and 9.0% during the cooling period can be achieved in comparison to a rule-based strategy with two-stage control for variable speed pumps.

KW  - Pareto optimal solution
KW  - Performance-price ratio
KW  - Average variability
KW  - Sensitive ratio
AB  - Based on the concept of performance-price ratio, we propose a quantitative method to solve multi-objective optimization problems. A new hypothesis is established in this paper: market rules that seek a higher-performing product with a lower price are used to compare and select Pareto non-inferior solutions. After carefully observing the distribution of the Pareto front, we find that the distribution is monotonically increasing or decreasing. This means that different variability exists in the Pareto front and that new inherent disciplines can be found. Based on this discovery, we use the performance-price ratio as a reference to construct the average variability that adjacent non-inferior solutions correspond to the objective function values. Then, the sensitivity ratio that is similar to the performance-price ratio is obtained, and a quantitative method is developed to evaluate Pareto non-inferior solutions. Two important achievements are derived: (1) based on the sensitivity ratio, a new subset of the Pareto non-inferior solution set is formed in accordance with the dominance relationship. The number of Pareto non-inferior solutions is reduced, and the bias degree corresponding to every Pareto non-inferior solution is obtained for different objectives. Thus, it is convenient for decision makers to select Pareto non-inferior solutions based on their preferences. (2) In the new subset of Pareto non-inferior solutions, the solution that corresponds to the minimal absolute value difference of the sensitivity ratio for different optimization objectives is defined as an unbiased and good solution. Accordingly, we obtain the optimal solution that is acceptable for every objective. Finally, the method is illustrated with a numerical example.

AB  - A rational and reliable energy benchmark is useful for understanding and enhancing building performance while most buildings cannot provide sufficient information for a detailed energy assessment. This work presents a systematic methodology of developing dynamic energy benchmarks for individual office building with very limited information. Simultaneously, an energy consumption rating (ECR) system is established to provide vertical energy assessment for individual office building in a short time span, i.e. hourly. Based on the data produced by DOE prototype large office building model performed in the EnergyPlus environment, this study is conducted in three steps: (1) Step 1: Data preparation; (2) Step 2: Development of the dynamic energy benchmarks; and (3) Step 3: Evaluation of the dynamic energy benchmarks and ECR system. Based on the decision tree analysis, the system energy consumption is classified into eight patterns by few commonly accessible weather and time variables, i.e. outdoor dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, day type and time type. Then, four energy benchmarks are developed according to four energy consumption patterns on weekdays. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic energy benchmarks, it is used to evaluate the building energy performance on September, October and November, respectively. Besides, comparative analysis is conducted between the energy baseline (i.e. the same benchmark is used for all energy consumption patterns) and proposed dynamic energy benchmarks. Accordingly, the hourly ECRs were calculated using energy baseline and proposed dynamic energy benchmarks, respectively. Results showed that the energy baseline can be improved by using the proposed dynamic energy benchmarks. And the proposed method is capable of evaluating the energy performance of information poor office buildings.

The mathematical efficiency, the physical reasonableness and the reliability in dealing with redundant objectives of PCA are verified by typical DTLZ5 test function and multi-objective correlation analysis of supercritical airfoil, and the proposed method is integrated into aircraft multi-disciplinary design (AMDEsign) platform, which contains aerodynamics, stealth and structure weight analysis and optimization module. Then the proposed method is used for the multi-point integrated aerodynamic optimization of a wide-body passenger aircraft, in which the redundant objectives identified by PCA are transformed to optimization constraints, and several design methods are compared. The design results illustrate that the strategy used in this paper is sufficient and multi-point design requirements of the passenger aircraft are reached. The visualization level of non-dominant Pareto set is improved by effectively reducing the dimension without losing the primary feature of the problem.

AB  - The uncertainty of task allocation in disaster environments is challenging both practically and theoretically. In real environments, agents encounter uncertain factors for the selection and execution of tasks. The present methods for task allocation seem inadequate in such environments. This paper aims to provide an efficient approach to improving the task allocation, despite the uncertainty in disaster environments. Therefore, after deduction of the major uncertainties in disaster environments, we propose a method for the agents’ decision-making about the task allocation. The allocation procedure includes four phases of ordering the tasks, choosing the coordinating agent, implementing the auction by considering the uncertainties, performing tasks and observing the real environment. The main innovation of this research is using the concepts of interval uncertainty in the task ordering as well as in the auction implementing. The results were obtained by comparing the proposed method with the contract net protocol (CNP) at three scales. In addition, the results were evaluated in the presence of uncertainties at different ranges. On average, the proposed method was better than the CNP in terms of search and rescue (SAR) operation time (124min), the number of dead people (8) and the number of incorrect allocations (180 tasks). The uncertainties range in the tasks’ decision-making procedure affected SAR operation time by more than 26%. Therefore, considering that uncertainty in task allocation can be a great advantage in the disaster environment, and considering these factors in the decision-making procedure, we have improved confidence in allocating tasks with fewer errors.

In this paper, we present a new methodology for (i) targeting areas in a manufacturing setting that could benefit from a PHM system, and (ii) testing and comparing PHM strategies for implementation on the targeted areas. Our proposed WEAR methodology is inspired by its four principal steps: (1) World – identifying targets, (2) Experiments – collecting candidate PHM strategies, (3) Assess – evaluating the proposed strategies using simulation, and (4) Return – constructing a business case for PHM implementation. The goal of the methodology is to streamline the decision making process before installing a PHM system so that the impacts of PHM are maximized with regards to the manufacturing system as a whole, and the total cost of implementation is reduced. A case study is presented in which the WEAR methodology was implemented at a manufacturing facility in cooperation with an industry partner.

AB  - Regional water cycles increasingly reflect the dual influences of natural and social processes, and are affected by global climate change and expanding human activities. Understanding how to maintain a healthy state of the water cycle has become an important proposition for sustainable development of human society. In this paper, natural-social attributes of the water cycle are synthesized and 19 evaluation indices are selected from four dimensions, i.e., water-based ecosystem integrity, water quality, water resource abundance and water resource use. A hierarchical water-cycle health evaluation system is established. An analytic hierarchy process is used to set the weight of the criteria layer and index layer, and the health threshold for each index is defined. Finally, a water-cycle health composite-index assessment model and fuzzy recognition model are constructed based on the comprehensive index method and fuzzy mathematics theory. The model is used to evaluate the state of health of the water cycle in Beijing during 2010–2014 and in the planning year (late 2014), considering the transfer of 1 billion m3 of water by the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP). The results show health scores for Beijing of 2.87, 3.10, 3.38, 3.11 and 3.02 during 2010–2014. The results of fuzzy recognition show that the sub-healthy grade accounted for 54%, 49%, 61% and 49% of the total score, and all years had a sub-healthy state. Results of the criteria layer analysis show that water ecosystem function, water quality and water use were all at the sub-healthy level and that water abundance was at the lowest, or sick, level. With the water transfer from the SNWDP, the health score of the water cycle in Beijing reached 4.04. The healthy grade accounted for 60% of the total score, and the water cycle system was generally in a healthy state. Beijing’s water cycle health level is expected to further improve with increasing water diversion from the SNWDP and industrial restructuring.

AB  - This article chronologically reviews the works, achievements, and professional life accomplishment of Prof. Ueda, who passed away in November 2015. He had been interested in systems of artifacts. Starting with clarification of systems of cutting and chip formation, he later emphasized manufacturing systems, particularly addressing biologically inspired systems: Biological Manufacturing Systems (BMS). Subsequently, he advocated emergent synthesis, an important and fundamental concept of manufacturing especially during the more complex era of recent excess information-driven societies. Later, his research interests extended to social systems. He examined dynamic interactions with consumers during product design and manufacture. Such a mindset led him to conceptualize co-creative decision making among producers, consumers, recyclers, and other stakeholders, which has now become a fundamental theory that is used broadly in reality. Additionally, in line with co-creative decision making studies, he sincerely explored the issue of value, finally developing the value creation model, which originates in emergent synthesis. The model can be a key factor in consideration of how to produce value through manufacturing in society. Those inspirational works by Prof. Ueda have shone brilliantly to the present day. We dedicate this article to the great professor, Kanji Ueda.

AB  - In this study, the application of a transductive support vector machine (TSVM), an innovative semi-supervised learning algorithm, has been proposed for mapping the potential drill targets at a detailed exploration stage. The semi-supervised learning method is a hybrid of supervised and unsupervised learning approach that simultaneously uses both training and non-training data to design a classifier. By using the TSVM algorithm, exploration layers at the Dalli porphyry Cu-Au deposit in the central Iran were integrated to locate the boundary of the Cu-Au mineralization for further drilling. By applying this algorithm on the non-training (unlabeled) and limited training (labeled) Dalli exploration data, the study area was classified in two domains of Cu-Au ore and waste. Then, the results were validated by the earlier block models created, using the available borehole and trench data. In addition to TSVM, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was also implemented on the study area for comparison. Thirty percent of the labeled exploration data was used to evaluate the performance of these two algorithms. The results revealed 87 percent correct recognition accuracy for the TSVM algorithm and 82 percent for the SVM algorithm. The deepest inclined borehole, recently drilled in the western part of the Dalli deposit, indicated that the boundary of Cu-Au mineralization, as identified by the TSVM algorithm, was only 15 m off from the actual boundary intersected by this borehole. According to the results of the TSVM algorithm, six new boreholes were suggested for further drilling at the Dalli deposit. This study showed that the TSVM algorithm could be a useful tool for enhancing the mineralization zones and consequently, ensuring a more accurate drill hole planning.

AB  - Controller design aspect for automatic generation control (AGC) of multi-area power system is often regarded as an optimization problem with different conflicting objectives. The controller must fulfill these objectives to produce a feasible set of solution as per the requirements of the designer. This paper explores the design and performance analysis of a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller employing Jaya algorithm for AGC of an interconnected power system. A filter with derivative term is used with PID controller to minimize the effect of noise in the input signal. The different performance measures considered are integral-time-multiplied-absolute-error (ITAE), the minimization of peak overshoots and the settling times of the deviations in the frequencies and tie-line power. Furthermore, these performance measures i.e. objectives are combined to form a single objective problem using analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Recently proposed Jaya algorithm, which is free from algorithm-specific parameters, is used for minimizing this single objective. The two-area interconnected linear power system model is considered for the simulation process. The simulation studies are carried out under five different cases with diverse sets of disturbances. The efficacy and superiority of the proposed Jaya algorithm based PID controller is shown by comparing simulation results with other algorithms like particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), Nelder-Mead simplex (NMS), elephant herding optimization (EHO) and teacher learner based optimization (TLBO). Time-domain simulations and statistical analysis are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

AB  - Structure modeling and optimizing are important topics for the design and control of robots. In this paper, we propose a process for modeling robots and optimizing their structure. This process is illustrated via a case study of a robot gripper mechanism that has a closed-loop and a single degree of freedom (DOF) structure. Our aim is to conduct a detailed study of the gripper in order to provide an in-depth step-by-step demonstration of the design process and to illustrate the interactions among its steps. First, geometric model is established to find the relationship between the operational coordinates giving the location of the end-effector and the joint coordinates. Then, equivalent Jacobian matrix is derived to find the kinematic model; and the dynamic model is obtained using Lagrange formulation. Based on these models, a structural multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem is formalised in the static configuration of the gripper. The objective is to determine the optimum force extracted by the robot gripper on the surface of a grasped rigid object under geometrical and functional constraints. The optimization problem of the gripper design is solved using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm version II (NSGA-II). The Pareto-optimal solutions are investigated to establish some meaningful relationships between the objective functions and variable values. Finally, design sensitivity analysis is carried out to compute the sensitivity of objective functions with respect to design variables.

AB  - Honeybees are critically important for the environment and to the economy. However, there are in substantial decline worldwide, leading to serious threat to the stability and yield of food crops. Beekeeping is of pivotal importance, combining the wide economical aspect of honey production and the important ecological services provided by honeybees. In this scenario, the prompt identification of beekeeping areas is strategic, since it maximised productivity and lowered the risks of colony losses. Fuzzy logic is an ideal approach for problem-solving tasks, as it is specifically designed to manage problems with a high degree of uncertainty. This research tested a novel GIS-based approach to assess beekeeping suitability of lands located in Calabria (Southern Italy), without relying to Analytic Hierarchy Process – Multiple Criteria Decision Making (AHP-MCDM), thus avoiding the constraints due to the technique and decision makers’ influences. Furthermore, the data used here were completely retrieved from open access sources, highlighting that our approach is characterized by low costs and can be easily reproduced for a wide arrays of geographical contexts. Notably, the results obtained by our experiments were validated by the actual beekeeping reality. Besides beekeeping, the use of this system could not only be applied in beekeeping land suitability evaluations, but may be successfully extended to other types of land suitability evaluations.

KW  - Preference
AB  - In this paper we propose a preference-based multi-objective optimization model for reservoir flood control operation (RFCO). This model takes the water preserving demand into consideration while optimizing two conflicting flood control objectives. A preference based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with decomposition, named MOEA/D-PWA, is developed for solving the proposed RFCO model. For RFCO, it is challenging to define the preferred region formally, as the preference information is implicit and difficult to formulate. MOEA/D-PWA estimates the preferred region dynamically according to the final water level of solutions in the population, and then guides the search by propelling solutions towards the preferred region. Experimental results on four types of floods at the Ankang reservoir have illustrated that the suggested MOEA/D-PWA can successfully produce solutions in the preferred region of the Pareto front. The schedules obtained by MOEA/D-PWA can significantly reduce the flood peak and guarantee the dam safety as well. The proposed MOEA/D-PWA is also efficient in term of computational cost.

AB  - In the recent years, increasing attention has been posed towards enhancing the sustainability of manufacturing processes by reducing the consumption of resources and key materials, the energy consumption and the environmental footprint, while also increasing companies’ competitiveness in global market contexts. De- and remanufacturing includes the set of technologies/systems, tools and knowledge-based methods to recover and reuse functions and materials from industrial waste and post-consumer products, under a Circular Economy perspective. This new paradigm can potentially support the sustainability challenges in strategic manufacturing sectors, such as aeronautics, automotive, electronics, consumer goods, and mechatronics. A new generation of smart de- and remanufacturing systems showing higher levels of automation, flexibility and adaptability to changing material mixtures and values is emerging and there is a need for systematizing the existing approaches to support their operations. Such innovative de- and remanufacturing system design, management and control approaches as well as advanced technological enablers have a key role to support the Circular Economy paradigm. This paper revises system level problems, methods and tools to support this paradigm and highlights the main challenges and opportunities towards a new generation of advanced de- and remanufacturing systems.

AB  - In wastewater systems as one of the most important urban infrastructures, the adverse consequences and effects of unsuitable performance and failure event can sometimes lead to disrupt part of a city functioning. By identifying high failure risk areas, inspections can be implemented based on the system status and thus can significantly increase the sewer network performance. In this study, a new risk assessment model is developed to prioritize sewer pipes inspection using Bayesian Networks (BNs) as a probabilistic approach for computing probability of failure and weighted average method to calculate the consequences of failure values. Finally to consider uncertainties, risk of a sewer pipe is obtained from integration of probability and consequences of failure values using a fuzzy inference system (FIS). As a case study, sewer pipes of a local wastewater collection network in Iran are prioritized to inspect based on their criticality. Results show that majority of sewers (about 62%) has moderate risk, but 12%of sewers are in a critical situation. Regarding the budgetary constraints, the proposed model and resultant risk values are expected to assist wastewater agencies to repair or replace risky sewer pipelines especially in dealing with incomplete and uncertain datasets.

The research involved a 4-step methodology combining statistical and operations research tools. The findings were as follows: (1) the project suffered from high variability and low performance across several important process parameters; (2) Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that approximately 40.51% of variability in the data could be explained by two principal components; (3) Data envelopment analysis (DEA) revealed that 47% of the decision making units (DMUs) were inefficient, and 73% of DMUs exhibited increasing returns to scale; (4) regression results showed that adjusted R2 values ranged between 0.913 and 0.996 for the models of DEA efficiency, and significant explanatory variables were extracted based on type III sum of squares. This research is significant in the biowaste-to-energy literature in that it provides a robust method for identifying process bottlenecks in industrial-scale anaerobic digestion of food waste.

The risk extent (rating) corresponding to a particular risk source has been expressed as a function of two parameters: likelihood (possibility) of occurrence and impact (consequence of occurrence). The concept of risk matrix has been explored herein to categorise various risk factors at different levels of severity for the establishment of necessary actions requirement plan. A case study of a metropolitan construction project for building an underground metro rail station has been reported here to demonstrate application procedural steps of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Sustainable management of water resources necessitates close attention to social, economic and environmental aspects such as water quality and quantity concerns and potential conflicts. This study presents a new fuzzy-based multi-objective compromise methodology to determine the socio-optimal and sustainable policies for hydro-environmental management of groundwater resources, which simultaneously considers the conflicts and negotiation of involved stakeholders, uncertainties in decision makers' preferences, existing uncertainties in the groundwater parameters and groundwater quality and quantity issues. The fuzzy multi-objective simulation-optimization model is developed based on qualitative and quantitative groundwater simulation model (MODFLOW and MT3D), multi-objective optimization model (NSGA-II), Monte Carlo analysis and Fuzzy Transformation Method (FTM). Best compromise solutions (best management policies) on trade-off curves are determined using four different Fuzzy Social Choice (FSC) methods. Finally, a unanimity fallback bargaining method is utilized to suggest the most preferred FSC method. Kavar-Maharloo aquifer system in Fars, Iran, as a typical multi-stakeholder multi-objective real-world problem is considered to verify the proposed methodology. Results showed an effective performance of the framework for determining the most sustainable allocation policy in groundwater resource management.

AB  - As production networks grow globally, their complexity and susceptibility to risk are increasing as well. Due to internal and external factors, risks affect individual network nodes and their impact propagates through the network to affect other nodes. A Fuzzy Dynamic Inoperability Input/output Model (FDIIM) is developed to facilitate and analyse the risk and its propagation in global production networks (GPN), at the strategic level. This method applies fuzzy arithmetic to track and operate with uncertainty in GPN parameters and to estimate the confidence in the results obtained. The expert provides a judgement on relevant risk parameters’ values in the form of linguistic values, where relevant statistical data is absent. We used the measure of ambiguity to measure uncertainty in the GPN parameters. Two types of analyses are carried out: (1) to examine the sensitivity of the FDIIM to changes in input parameter values, including interdependencies between GPN nodes, resilience of the GPN, intended revenues and impact of disruptions, and (2) to examine sensitivity to uncertainty in the GPN’s input parameters. A generic GPN example and different risk scenarios are defined to illustrate these analyses. The analyses provide an insight into the importance of different GPN’s parameters in the risk analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated how to identify GPN parameters which are important to specify with less uncertainty.

AB  - This paper deals with group decision making and, in particular, with rank aggregation, which is the problem of aggregating individual preferences (rankings) in order to obtain a consensus ranking. Although this consensus ranking is usually a permutation of all the ranked items, in this paper we tackle the situation in which some items can be tied, that is, the consensus shows that there is no preference among them. This problem has arisen recently and is known as the Optimal Bucket Order Problem (OBOP). In this paper we propose two improvements to the standard greedy algorithm usually considered to approach the bucket order problem: the Bucket Pivot Algorithm (BPA). The first improvement is based on the introduction of the Utopian Matrix, a matrix associated to a pair order matrix that represents the precedences in a collection of rankings. This idealization constitutes a superoptimal solution to the OBOP, which can be used as an extreme (sometimes feasible) best value. The second improvement is based on the use of several items as pivots to generate the bucket order, in contrast to BPA that only uses a single pivot. The set of items playing the role of decision-maker is dynamically created. We analyze separately the contribution of each improvement and also their joint effect. The statistical analysis of the experiments carried out shows that the combined use of both techniques is the best choice, showing a significant improvement in accuracy (17%) with respect to the original BPA and providing an important reduction in the variance of the output. Moreover, we provide decision rules to help the decision maker to select the right algorithm according to the problem instance.

In this paper, we used the permafrost subgrade treatment, the permafrost distribution, geological engineering conditions, interference of facilities along the route, route length and 10 other indicators to reflect the factors affecting the selection of route in permafrost regions. An optimization model for highway route scheme was established based on matter element theory by comparing the optimal value of each evaluation program. The weight of each index was determined by an analytical hierarchy process. A case study shows that the optimal model was simple and intuitive, providing a new comprehensive evaluation method for route scheme selection considering the unique geological conditions in permafrost regions.

AB  - The role of stakeholders in organizational decision-making is gaining more and more attention. Managers find that in order to create value sustainably and ethically, it is necessary to balance the interests of various stakeholders. This trend is reflected in the management literature, where much advancement has been made in what is known as stakeholder theory. In the founding years of stakeholder theory there was a close connection and interchange of ideas between stakeholder theorists and operational researchers. Yet in recent years, the stream of papers that includes both fields has dwindled to a trickle. This lack of theoretical integration is surprising, as Operational Research is in nature a collaborative discipline. In this paper, we discuss three topics in stakeholder theory that can inform and improve studies involving working with stakeholders in Operational Research: instrumental versus moral stakeholder theory; focusing on trade-offs versus focusing on avoiding trade-offs; and focusing on the decision-making organization versus focusing on stakeholder engagement. We then conduct a systematic review of 144 Operational Research articles on the topic ‘stakeholders’. Content analysis of these articles reveals four distinct traditions of working with stakeholders: optimizing, balancing, structuring and involving. We compare the four traditions on goals, role of the analyst, type of data used, and results. Our analysis provides the basis for recommendations to Operational Research practitioners on how to work with stakeholders.

AB  - A methodology of multiobjective design optimization of laminated composite plates with piezoelectric layers is presented in this paper. Constrained optimization is conducted for different behaviour objectives, like the maximization of buckling load or natural frequencies of specific vibration modes or prescribed displacements for example. Weight minimization can also be considered or the minimization of the electric voltages applied in the piezoelectric actuators. The optimization problems are constrained by stress based failure criteria and other structural response constraints like limits imposed on certain displacements, buckling characteristics and natural frequency constraints. The design variables considered in the present work are the fiber reinforcement orientations in the composite layers, thicknesses of individual layers and the electric potentials applied to the actuators. The optimization problems are solved with two direct search derivative-free algorithms: GLODS (Global and Local Optimization using Direct Search) and DMS (Direct MultiSearch). DMS, the multiobjective optimization solver, is started from a set of local minimizers which are initially determined by the global optimizer algorithm GLODS for each one of the objective functions.

AB  - Based on the standardized Euclidean distance method, an evaluation theory for sustainable agricultural development was constructed, which includes a sustainable agricultural development model, an evaluation function model, a sustainable agricultural development exponent (SADE), a rank of the sustainable agricultural development, an index frame of the sustainable agricultural development, a goal system, and a zero system. Data from Zhenyuan County of Gansu province (ZYC) between 2000 and 2012 was used as a case study of the theory. The SADE of ZYC was [0.34, 0.90], and the agriculture system exhibited low sustainability from 2000 to 2003, mid sustainability from 2004 to 2007, and high sustainability from 2008 to 2012. The results explained the actual ZYC situation, and showed that the Euclidean distance method of sustainable agricultural development is feasible. The innovativeness and merits of the method include: (1) reliable methodology, (2) construction using goal and zero systems, which serve as reference systems of sustainable agricultural development and allow control of the evaluation, and (3) index weights embedded in the evaluation function, which prevents errors or mistakes in the expert scoring method and prevents the reassignment of index weights due to adding or subtracting indicators. The main reasons that the SADE increased in ZYC include suitable chemical fertilization and pesticide application, enhancement of conservation farming areas, soil testing and fertilizer-formulated areas, and drinking water security in rural and non-disaster crop areas. The main problems with increasing the SADE in ZYC include straw application and low farmer income, both of which should be increased.

AB  - Retail industry growth in Indonesia is considered significant and will continue, related to Indonesian lifestyle changes. One of the important things to consider is location determination. The complexity of the location determination problem for the development of a business requires a comprehensive decision support system, using relevant data and appropriate technology so that it can accommodate a variety of data formats and information. This paper described the spatial pattern analysis approach to discover patterns of fast food restaurants. ArcGIS Spatial Autocorrelation (Moran’s I) tool was used to find evidence that the fast food restaurant distribution in Jakarta, as the biggest city in Indonesia, has a clustered pattern and were not the result of random chance. The clustered pattern was investigated using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify the clustered area of fast food restaurant.

AB  - The use of desktop technologies, opposed to their mobile counterparts, is still predominant in the business domain and daily corporate activities. For complex business tasks, the usability of mobile applications is still perceived as inferior. Nevertheless, mobile computing could support work activities in different ways. This research seeks to explore whether mobile applications, especially sophisticated real-time groupware such as Group Decision Support Systems can match or even outperform their desktop-based counterparts regarding task performance and user satisfaction. To provide a more comprehensive comparison, two widely used web metric frameworks, HEART and PULSE (the former focusing on human behavior and the latter focusing on technology), have been used to evaluate and compare a web-based mobile group decision support app with its desktop counterpart on a chair-led multi-step decision-making process in lab settings and real-world contexts. Moreover, data from web tracking tools and system logs of these two apps have been analyzed to deepen the level of analysis. Therefore, an innovative methodology for usability research combining lab experiments with long-term web observations is proposed. The results have shown that users interacting with the mobile version of the system had a steeper learning curve than users interacting with the desktop one. After a short practice period, participants using the mobile version of the groupware could perform as efficiently as participants using its desktop counterpart. Not only both the mobile and the desktop version of the app were used effectively for the group decision tasks chosen for this study, but also the two versions of the application were rated similarly in terms of user satisfaction. Furthermore, the mobile version had a faster adoption, better engagement, and better retention than its desktop counterpart. Despite an additional groupware middleware layer and a sophisticated user interface rendering layer, both groupware versions have yielded a user-to-user response time sufficient for real-time group interactions. These results convey important implications: as society is quickly moving towards mobile computing, web-based mobile technologies can now support multi-step group decision-making tasks.

AB  - Public transport in urban areas has been observed to have contributed significantly to the reduction of traffic congestion and pollution, providing alternate means of sustainable transport mode and in a general improvement in ‘quality of life’ of city dwellers. In developing countries like India, rapid urbanization has led to increased travel demand, an increase in a number of the personalized vehicles; however, lack of commensurate comprehensive transportation planning in urban areas has put tremendous pressure on the existing inadequate and out of date transport infrastructure. In order to overcome such alarming situation, improved public transport both in qualitative and quantitative terms has been recommended from all quarters. The present study assesses the existing ‘quality of services’ of midi buses operating in Patna, India. Accordingly, a Likert-type ordinal scale rating based face-to-face survey was conducted among midi bus users in Patna. Respondents were asked to rate the 20 attributes of midi bus services in the city, in terms of satisfaction based on their experiences while commuting. A total of 402 refined questionnaires were analyzed using TOPSIS method. The findings will help to understand the shortcomings of the existing public bus service and provide the responsible authorities and bus operators with suggestions that can enhance the ‘quality of service’ and attract more users to public bus service. Commuters were found satisfied with ‘qualitative’ attributes such as ‘ticketing facility’, ‘seat comfort’, ‘condition of bus stops’, ‘condition of bus’, etc. while dissatisfaction was found for ‘bus information at the bus stop’, ‘frequency of bus service’ and ‘buses being on time’. This study justifies the need of improving ‘qualitative’ aspects of existing bus services. The findings of the study will provide the policy makers and bus operators in planning and implement the effective and sustainable public transport system in future for small and mid-sized cities of developing countries.

AB  - Predictive biomarkers can guide treatment decisions in breast cancer. Many studies are undertaken to discover and translate these biomarkers, yet few biomarkers make it to practice. Before use in clinical decision making, predictive biomarkers need to demonstrate analytical validity, clinical validity and clinical utility. While attaining analytical and clinical validity is relatively straightforward, by following methodological recommendations, the achievement of clinical utility is extremely challenging. It requires demonstrating three associations: the biomarker with the outcome (prognostic association), the effect of treatment independent of the biomarker, and the differential treatment effect between the prognostic and the predictive biomarker (predictive association). In addition, economical, ethical, regulatory, organizational and patient/doctor-related aspects are hampering the translational process. Traditionally, these aspects do not receive much attention until formal approval or reimbursement of a biomarker test (informed by Health Technology Assessment (HTA)) is at stake, at which point the clinical utility and sometimes price of the test can hardly be influenced anymore. When HTA analyses are performed earlier, during biomarker research and development, they may prevent further development of those biomarkers unlikely to ever provide sufficient added value to society, and rather facilitate translation of the promising ones. Early HTA is particularly relevant for the predictive biomarker field, as expensive medicines are under pressure and the need for biomarkers to guide their appropriate use is huge. Closer interaction between clinical researchers and HTA experts throughout the translational research process will ensure that available data and methodologies will be used most efficiently to facilitate biomarker translation.

AB  - In the European Union, approximately 3.6milliontonnes of used tires are generated annually. Because used tires are not biodegradable, there is strong motivation to successfully manage this fast-growing waste flow. One of the most popular approaches for sustainable environmental stewardship of used tires is retreading. The problem investigated in this paper is to identify optimized purchasing, retreading, and inventory planning schemes of used tires in multiple tire retreading plants as well as allocation patterns of retreaded, reusable, and end-of-life tires that secure maximized profit within a multi-period planning horizon and under multiple uncertainties. This paper proposes an interval-parameter semi-infinite programming model for used tire management and planning. The underlying difference between this model and those developed in previous research is its ability to consider the effects of external impact factors related to complicated economic, environmental, and social activities on used tire management systems. Moreover, it can successfully handle real-life uncertainties of the used tire management systems expressed as functional and crisp intervals. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed model. Flexible long-term purchasing, retreading, inventory, and allocation plans, which are adjustable with variations of external impact factors, are obtained. The presented model has advantages in addressing the dynamic complexity of used tire management systems by introducing the functional interval parameters associated with the price of a new tire as well as electricity and gas prices and labor costs in waste management and transportation sectors. Compared with the available models, the resulting solutions are far more robust because they are able to satisfy all possible levels of external impact factors. The presented model is beneficial for the tire retreading industry, which processes millions of used tires annually.

Mainly focused on robotics, the literature relevant to ethics is shown to be scarce in the field of cyber-physical industrial system while relevant stakes are important. A set of recommendations is suggested and an example dealing with the industrial deployment of a cyber-physical system in transportation illustrates these recommendations.

AB  - Rapid development and transformation are the main causes for declining urban natural landscapes as well as its physical and environmental qualities. Currently, rehabilitation and preservation actions cause tough pressures to cities, which lead to serious damages on urban natural landscapes. These fragmentations, particularly in historical heritage cities, cause the riverscapes to lose their sustainability qualities. People’s sense of attachment, satisfaction, and social bonding with riverscapes are also being deteriorated. This subject has become one of the most challenging issues for the Malaysian government and its local authorities. This research aimed to establish the sustainable riverscape rehabilitation strategy framework for Malaysia’s historical heritage cities from the urban design and planning perspectives. The research methodology was designed in two phases. Phase one has developed the sustainable riverscape rehabilitation strategy framework for Malaysia’s historical heritage cities by applying the goal-oriented method. The second phase has validated the framework application using the Grounded Group Decision Making (GGDM) method. For validation, the feasibility study shows the expert input has reached more than 70% saturation for all feasibility assessment factors, except technical aspects of the factor project potential for extension, which has received 45% saturation. This strategy framework involves sustainability domains; social benefits, environmental quality, and economic growth. Moreover, this strategy framework formulates a sustainable riverscape rehabilitation index score for promoting riverscape preservation. It integrates the Malaysian government, stakeholders, and public participations in riverscape rehabilitation activities.

AB  - Agriculture crop residues represent one of the largest and most diversified sources for producing bio-fuel. However, these resources are highly heterogeneous in terms of the physicochemical properties, spatial distribution and logistics associated costs. These factors are the major bottlenecks hindering the success of biomass energy conversion facilities that use crop residues. The purpose of this study was to develop an integrated GIS-based Fuzzy AHP methodology. This approach combines both spatial and non-spatial factors, such as the logistics factor, transport cost indicators, and technical and geographic restrictions in the study area. The identification of these factors for the actors involved in energy planning provides at a broad-scale multidimensional analysis that allows for the identification of the best sites for a bioenergy plant. This methodology was applied in the department of Santander (Colombia) due to its intense agricultural activity, reflecting the important energy potential of biomass. For three cocoa crop residues evaluated (pruning, rejected and cocoa pod husk), it was possible to identify 12 ideal places to install a bioenergy plant using this approach. The capacity of these biomass plants varies between 52,475 and 146,791 t/year, corresponding to 171 and 479 TJ/year, respectively.

In this review paper, research work on PVPS modeling, reliability, feasibility, field performance, design procedures and control strategies is analyzed and reported. In addition, technical challenges to this science are concluded in this review. According to the results, the numerical method is recommended for sizing PVPS. In the meanwhile, incremental conductance and artificial intelligent (AI) based maximum power point tracking algorithms are the most recommended control strategies for PVPS. On the other hand, According to reported PVPS performance, the average overall system's efficiency is about 3.4% with average annual productivity rate of 6580.611m3/kWp. In general PVPS have a number of challenges related to design procedure, modeling method, control strategy, availability of data and site obstacles such as shadow effects.

AB  - In this paper, surrogate-assisted optimisation of a U-shaped baffle square-duct heat exchanger (USBSD-HX) is proposed. A single-objective design problem is formulated to optimise the heat exchanger thermal performance and friction loss. Several surrogate models including a Kriging model, radial basis function interpolation, a quadratic response surface model and support vector regression are used for objective function approximation. The self-adaptive differential evolution with neighbourhood search (SaNSDE) is improved by introducing a new mutation strategy and employing the weighted sum of exploitation and exploration indicators for solution selection. A design demonstration of USBSD-HX reveals that the simultaneous use of multiple surrogate models gives better results. The proposed meta-heuristic is a powerful optimiser for this design task. Optimum USBSD-HX using air as the working fluid is also obtained in this study.

AB  - Power system emergency control is one key defense strategy in contingencies for protecting the system from cascading blackout. Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) is one such strategy to ensure system stability by shedding load to retrieve balance between power supply and demand. Novel UFLS scheme design and a scheme optimization approach are proposed in this paper to find the optimal load-shedding schemes for different network partition resulted from contingencies. To obtain all possible UFLS schemes for a certain area, a candidate scheme set design algorithm based on value assigning of scheme parameters is proposed and then a relatively complete candidate scheme set is constructed. Considering network splitting caused by protection, several subsystems may exist from the reconstruction of independent network areas. The concept of homological area is defined and a graph-based method is used to analyse system topology change. Then, a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) algorithm is introduced for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) for global optimizing candidate schemes. Optimal schemes for an area in both isolated area and homological area cases can be derived from all feasible UFLS schemes by MADM method. Simulation results demonstrate that the UFLS schemes can effectively restore system frequency in different network topologies.

AB  - Rivers are one of the main water resources for agricultural, drinking, environmental and industrial use. Water quality indices can and have been used to identify threats to water quality along a stream and contribute to better water resources management. There are many water quality indices for the assessment and use of surface water for drinking purposes. However, there is no well-established index for the assessment and direct use of river water for irrigation purposes. The aim of this study was to adopt the framework of the National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSFWQI) and, with adjustments, apply it in a way which will conform to irrigation water quality requirements. To accomplish this, the NSFWQI parameters for drinking water use were amended to include water quality parameters suitable for irrigation. For each selected parameter, an individual weighting chart was generated according to the FAO 29 guideline. The NSFWQI formula was then used to calculate a final index value, and for each parameter an acceptable range in this value was determined. The new index was then applied to the Ghezel Ozan River in Iran as a case study. A forty five year record of water quality data (1966 to 2010) was collected from four hydrometery stations along the river. Water quality parameters including Na+, Cl−, pH, HCO−3, EC, SAR and TDS were employed for water quality analysis using the adjusted NSFWQI formula. The results of this case study showed variation in water quality from the upstream to downstream ends of the river. Consistent monitoring of the river water quality and the establishment of a long term management plan were recommended for the protection of this valuable water resource.

AB  - This paper presents the development and subsequent application of a facility location methodology for selecting good show locations for a traveling entertainment troupe in Bavaria, Germany. The troupe is headquartered at a theater in Munich and wishes to expand its audience by offering traveling shows to select sites across Bavaria. A spatial analysis of the region is completed via classic location theory modeling techniques, leading to the development of a multi-criteria facility location approach for application. Additionally, we use location analytics techniques on demographic and consumer spending data extracted from the Business Analyst Web App (BAWA) system for each of the 95 districts in Bavaria. This data is integrated into a decision support system to weight consumer demand values with district lifestyle population patterns aggregated at the postal code level. Lifestyle-weighted demand is then used to identify locations that maximize the amount of customers within a given travel distance to a show while maintaining dispersion of selected facilities.

AB  - The purpose of this research article is to identify the critical success criteria/factors that affect the cloud computing adoption and examine structure, reliability and validity of the criteria in the SMEs industry. This study considers nine types of criteria/factors with fifty-one sub-criteria, which have somewhat previously been used, and creates a ranking model that offers decision makers to measure the prior implementation of cloud computing adoption. A questionnaire-based survey research was used to collect data from 110 firms belonging to the SMEs industry in India. In this paper, the data collected was analysed by an integrated approach. Firstly, an Analytic Hierarchy Process approach was applied to find the significant fact of each criterion as the assessable indices of the cloud computing adoption. Secondly, an Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis were used to examine structure, reliability and validity of the criteria. The data was tabulated in a Microsoft Excel sheet and then imported in SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20) for analysis. The findings discovered that ‘Security and Privacy’, ‘Organizational Risk’, ‘Sharing and Collaboration’, ‘Confidentiality’, and ‘Integrity’ have a major effect on the adoption of cloud computing. The research was conducted in the SMEs industry in India, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The findings and recommendations offer cloud computing service providers as well as users with a better understanding of what affects the cloud computing adoption feature, with a relevant understanding of the current scenario. The research aided in the application of the new technology of cloud computing adoption in the SMEs industry in India through the use of a wide range of criteria. The findings also help organizations study their information technology investments when applying cloud computing.

AB  - This paper presents a Fuzzy Estimation Approach based on Decision Making (FEADM) to estimate point soil moisture, in order to develop a regional soil moisture estimate. This keeps the advantages of an automatic irrigation system but avoiding their operational complexity. In the FEADM 's first stage, the Fuzzy Analytical Process weigh five fuzzified environmental inputs used as assessment criteria. These criteria are used by a selective assessment stage, where only the relevant criteria for each alternative are assessed. As result, the best assessments of each alternative and the best assessed alternative are obtained. In the second stage, an output membership function is assigned to every alternative for its forward aggregation and defuzzification. This process reaches a soil moisture estimate. Unlike other models, FEADM allows estimating a quantitative value from a decision making process. Furthermore, its computational cost is lower than conventional fuzzy estimation models due to the selective assessment.

AB  - An improved multi-objective optimization model based on goal programming (GP) for supporting reservoir operation was developed under inflow senarios of multiple runoff guarantee rates (i.e., 25%, 75%, perennial mean, and 95%) and ecological goals with the combination of steady- and pulse-state ecological water demands. Under these four scenarios, discharge flows of Danjingkou Reservoir would be 358.40, 369.67, 268.91 and 98.14×108m3/a, and those at Taocha Canal headwork would be 104.61, 86.62, 95.08 and 64.00×108m3/a, respectively. The generated results for stream flows could successfully meet the predetermined operational goals for the project. Comparatively, under the scenario of 95% runoff guarantee rate, the obtained strategies could not satisfy the ecological water demands. The modeling results indicated that the capacity of water diversion and storage for Danjiangkou Reservoir would be enhanced due to the operation of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. The results showed the risks associated with possible flooding would be comparatively low under those four runoff guarantee rates. This represents the current priority for flood control in Danjiangkou Reservoir needs to be changed into multiple ones including ecological water supply, water transfer, as well as downstream water security maintenance.

AB  - Against a backdrop of increasing energy demand, the development of wave energy technology is a logical means of both meeting this demand and mitigating the environmental degradation associated with conventional power generation. Previous research has made considerable progress in the climatic characterization and short-term forecasting of wave energy. However, medium- to long-term predictions of wave energy resources, which are central to the development of future operating and trading strategies, remain scarce. This study provides an overview of long-term climatic trends and medium- to long-term predictions of wave energy, before discussing the focus of future predictions. Finally, a new method is proposed for predicting wave energy resources on a medium- to long-term basis that incorporates the swell index and propagation characteristics of swell energy. This model was developed with the aim of improving the precision of wave energy predictions, thereby providing a reference for the effective utilization of wave resources. The results of this study demonstrate that long-term climatic trend analysis should include not only variations in wave power density (WPD), but also long-term variability in wave energy stability, energy level occurrence, and variability in the occurrence of effective significant wave height (SWH). The medium- to long-term prediction of wave energy should also synthetically consider the above factors. We conclude that monitoring the propagation of swell energy and calculating the swell index constitutes a robust theoretical basis for predicting the WPD of mixed wave.

AB  - The paper presents building of a model, i.e. House of Strategy, out of a two-round Delphi survey, which can be used in strategic planning to develop sets of Goals, Objectives, and Strategies. The survey was made among the stakeholders of the Indian Shrimp Industry in order to set the future goals, and concurrent objectives and to design strategies to achieve them. The first round of Delphi survey resulted into generation of sets of Goal, Objectives, and Strategies. The second round of the survey gathered opinions of survey panelists regarding the desirability and feasibility of the Goals and Objectives, and feasibility and effectiveness of the Strategies. Consensuses of stakeholders’ opinions on the each of the items with respect to above said criteria were estimated using standard fuzzy consensus building algorithm. Hierarchical representation of a Goal, their corresponding Objectives and Strategies form a tree like structure, called as GOS tree. Seven such GOS trees were developed, each representing a Goal at its top echelon. Validity of each GOS tree was tested using the ratings of the panelists on the goal, objectives, and strategies with respect to the feasibility criterion. The proposed validation process of a GOS tree resulted two set of weights separately for the objectives and the strategies that explained the importance of each of the strategies in achieving the corresponding objective and importance of each of the objectives in aligning towards the goal. These importance weights of the objectives and the strategies were local to the GOS tree. Seven such GOS trees were developed each representing for a future goal. As a strategy might have presence in multiple GOS trees and contributing towards multiple goals, an overall contribution of the strategies was to be found out. We proposed a framework, House of Strategy, which can be used to combine all the GOS trees at one place and could help, in a two-step process, in finding out the overall contribution of each of the strategies towards overall achievement of Industry’s goals. The House of Strategy consisted of two sub-Houses, i.e. Goal-Objective (GO) and Objective-Strategy (OS) sub-Houses. In the first step, the GO sub-House calculated the overall priority of each of the Objectives depending on its local importance weights (with respect to each of the GOS tree it represented) and corresponding desirability of the local goal and its own desirability score. Similarly, in the second step, the OS sub-House helped in calculating the overall priority of each of the strategies depending upon the priority of its corresponding objectives (in a GOS tree) as derived by the GO sub-House, its local importance weights (with respect to each of the GOS tree it represented), and its own effectiveness score. Using the House of Strategy, we have prioritized the strategies raised during the Delphi survey. The proposed methodology of building the House of Strategy can be used for designing strategies for an organization/industry using stakeholders' opinion and prioritizing them in order of their overall importance in achieving intended objectives and goals. Furthermore, the House of Strategy can be used as an effective communication tool to portray the goals, objectives, and strategies along with their priorities at one place.

AB  - In this paper, an application of a knowledge-driven mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) approach so-called “the evidential belief functions (EBFs) using Dempster-Shafer's rule of combination” is proposed. This technique is used to weight and integrate a large scale exploration dataset in order to localize prospects for definition of further exploration drilling sites. In this study, exploration datasets of Seridune copper deposit in the Kerman province, SE Iran used for the methodology. In this regard, geophysical evidence layers extracted from interpretation of magnetic and electrical surveys, geological evidence layers derived via the geological datasets (i.e. lithology, fault and alteration), and geochemical evidence maps were generated and integrated for MPM. Furthermore, various MPM approaches including outranking, index overlay and fuzzy logic methods were examined for comparison with the introduced method. To evaluate and compare the efficiency of the methods, the productivity of the drilled boreholes (Cu concentration multiplied by its ore thickness along each drilled borehole) was used to validate the generated prospectivity models. The results showed higher efficiency of the Dempster-Shafer's model in comparison with the prospectivity models generated using other MPM approaches.

AB  - Most of fresh tomatoes sold in the United States (US) are grown using protected agriculture. The risk of contamination and severe disease outbreaks in humans due to foodborne pathogens linked to fresh produce are a constant threat to the public and the industry. To date, there are limited tools to prioritize food safety management practices in commercial greenhouses to reinforce food safety in a timely manner. One rapid cost effective approach, originally applied in education and healthcare, is the Delphi method that uses expert opinion to quantify and rank priorities. An iterative systematic Delphi expert elicitation approach was used to prioritize management factors for the reduction of foodborne pathogen contamination in tomato greenhouses in the US. A validated online survey addressing eight thematic areas (water management, workers, environment and greenhouse design, equipment sanitation, waste management, animal intrusion, traceability, and propagation) was discussed among 20 individuals internationally recognized as experts in fresh produce production in protected agriculture, foodborne pathogens, and food safety theory and practice. Consensus rankings of activities and practices most likely contributing to microbial contamination and its mitigation were determined. Food safety priorities to prevent contamination of greenhouse tomatoes, in order of significance (i.e, ranking scale, weighted average; 1 lowest, 5 highest), included handwashing (4.67), environmental controls (4.32), enforceable worker health policy (3.94), cleaning and sanitation of reusable plastic containers (3.94), reused retail-ready containers (3.89), and irrigation water testing for human pathogens (3.84) to prevent contamination of greenhouse tomato. The majority of experts indicated that contaminated greenhouse surfaces that are in contact (direct or indirect) with the fruits are important sources of pathogen transfer to fresh tomatoes, highlighting the need for environmental controls in greenhouses. Importance of adequate worker management practices including handwashing and health policy highlights the role of worker education in reducing the risks of foodborne outbreaks linked to greenhouse grown produce. This report illustrates the benefits of using Delphi approach to improve food safety in greenhouses. The provided priority list can be used by growers to guide the routine food safety practice implementation procedures.

In this paper, we propose research on decision support for controlling sustainable performance induced by maintenance processes based on the core principles of decision systems. We discuss their application in maintenance, and underline the weaknesses of current practices in this domain. As we are particularly interested in key performance indicators, dashboards and prognosis approaches, we have reviewed the work on these subjects conducted by different scientific communities. This study allows us to propose a set of founding elements to conduct research on dashboards for sustainable performance in maintenance. Among these elements, we define sustainable value, sustainable signature, and sustainable state of the equipment. We suggest implementing such dashboards in Sustainable Condition-Based Maintenance (SCBM) based on Remaining Sustainable Life (RSL), and we propose a framework to conduct this research using a systemic approach according to the process of dashboard building.

AB  - Advanced nuclear reactors offer safe, clean, and reliable energy at the global scale. The development of such devices relies heavily upon computational models, from the pre-conceptual stages through detailed design, licensing, and operation. An integrated reactor modeling framework that enables seamless communication, coupling, automation, and continuous development brings significant new capabilities and efficiencies to the practice of reactor design. In such a system, key performance metrics (e.g., optimal fuel management, peak cladding temperature in design-basis accidents, levelized cost of electricity) can be explicitly linked to design inputs (e.g., assembly duct thickness, tolerances), enabling an exceptional level of design consistency. Coupled with high-performance computing, thousands of integrated cases can be executed simultaneously to analyze the full system, perform complete sensitivity studies, and efficiently and robustly evaluate various design tradeoffs. TerraPower has developed such a tool—the Advanced Reactor Modeling Interface (ARMI) code system—and has deployed it to support the TerraPower Traveling Wave Reactor design and other innovative energy products currently under development. The ARMI code system employs pre-existing tools with strong pedigrees alongside many new physics and data management modules necessary for innovative design. Verification and validation against previous and new physical measurements, which remain an essential element of any sound design, are being carried out. This paper summarizes the integrated core engineering tools and practices in production at TerraPower.

This paper explores possible relations between highly sensitive urban areas and their visual prominence in the public interest: a study is performed, as an example, in the city of Geneva. A false-color “heat map” is built through GIS techniques by extracting photo shooting locations from the Flickr public repository, and overlapped on the ISOS Swiss cartography. This method can be used to establish a hierarchy of the viewpoints in the public space.

AB  - Application of compressed natural gas in public transportation has attracted environmental and social attentions worldwide for natural gas' low air pollutants emission, low cost, and availability. Constructing a suitable compressed natural gas network for public transportation in a city has thus become an important topic for the theory and practice of applying the compressed natural gas, which is considered as a key measure to solve the energy crisis and city congestion. The present paper proposed an integrated decision-making process of compressed natural gas siting for public transportation based on the method of multi-objective optimization, fuzzy evaluating, and radar charting. Multi-objective optimization is used to find the initial feasible solution under the city's requirement in economic, availability, safety and so on. Fuzzy evaluation then provides the criteria of decision-making. Radar charting presents a clear vision of all the candidate solutions for decision-making based on the different feature of the city condition. To illustrate the proposed process, the present paper takes the city of Wuhan, China as the case study.

AB  - With the ecological awareness throughout the world by the cause of global warming, both waste management and decreasing energy consumption have been a complication. Energy saving and generating techniques are being studied by plenty of organizations and institutes as well as academia. On the other hand, even for smallest municipalities, waste management is shifting into an obligation. Obtaining energy from biomass provides one positive solution for both problems; it prevents the wastes piling over and also provides energy. As a small city on the west coast of Turkey, Aydin, has its own waste disposal facility, yet, the municipality requires to validate the future existence of the existing facility together with evaluating the Waste-to-Energy facility alternative. This study utilizes Bayesian networks in order to evaluate optimum conditions for alternatives in waste management in addition to analyzing the coherence of the city specifications with the decision alternatives. It is observed that the city is adaptive to both decisions yet the change in scenarios also lead to changes in decisions.

AB  - Recent trend of research is to hybridize two and several number of variants to find out better quality of solution of practical and recent real applications in the field of global optimization problems. In this paper, a new approach hybrid Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) – Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) is exercised on twenty-two benchmark test, five bio-medical dataset and one sine dataset problems. Hybrid GWOSCA is combination of Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) used for exploitation phase and Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) for exploration phase in uncertain environment. The movement directions and speed of the grey wolve (alpha) is improved using position update equations of SCA. The numerical and statistical solutions obtained with hybrid GWOSCA approach is compared with other metaheuristics approaches such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Hybrid Approach GWO (HAGWO), Mean GWO (MGWO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA). The numerical and statistical experimental results prove that the proposed hybrid variant can highly be effective in solving benchmark and real life applications with or without constrained and unknown search areas.

AB  - The utility of micro air vehicles (MAVs) has expanded significantly in the last decade, and there are now numerous commercial systems available at relatively low cost. This expansion has arisen mainly due to the miniaturisation of flight control systems and advances in energy storage and propulsion technologies. Several emerging applications involve routine operation of MAVs in complex urban environments such as parcel delivery, communications relay and environmental monitoring. However, MAVs currently rely on one or more operators-in-the-loop and, whilst desirable, full autonomous operation has not yet been achieved. In this review paper, autonomous MAV operation in complex environments is explored with conceptualisation for future MAV operation in urban environments. Limitations of current technologies are systematically examined through consideration of the state-of-the-art and future trends. The main limitations challenging the realisation of fully autonomous MAVs are mainly attributed to: computational power, communication and energy storage. These limitations lead to poor sensing and planning capabilities, which are essential components of autonomous MAVs. Possible solutions are explored with goal of enabling MAVs to reliably operate autonomously in urban environments.

AB  - In recent years, the concept of “asset life extension” has become increasingly important to safety critical industries including nuclear power, offshore oil and gas, petrochemical, renewable energy, rail transport, aviation, shipping, electricity distribution and transmission, etc. Extending the service life of industrial assets can offer a broad range of economic, technical, social and environmental benefits as compared to other end-of-life management strategies such as decommissioning and replacement of equipment. The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive literature review and classification framework for academic research and industrial practices related to life extension of safety critical systems and installations. To achieve this, a systematic review is performed on the current state-of-the-art and new developments in the field of asset life extension in various industries. Major sources from which the literature can be gathered are identified and some assessment criteria are defined to categorize the selected publications. A classification framework is then proposed to support life extension decision making process with respect to the type of asset and industry sectors where the concept of life extension has been of interest, condition assessment techniques used for qualification of assets for life extension, life prediction models, life extension strategies, etc. The current key issues in relation to the subject are outlined and the strengths and weaknesses of existing life extension decision-making tools are highlighted. This review contains an exhaustive list of scientific references on the topic, including articles published in journals, industry magazines, books and conference proceedings, university dissertations, technical reports and government documents. The proposed literature classification and analysis can help asset owners, asset managers, service providers, stakeholders, public policy-makers, environment protection authorities, and regulatory bodies gain valuable insights on asset life extension decision-making procedures and methodologies.

KW  - Stakeholder participation
KW  - Fallback bargaining with impasse
AB  - In the present study, a BIOPLUME III simulation model is coupled with a non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II)-based model for optimal design of in situ groundwater bioremediation system, considering preferences of stakeholders. Ministry of Energy (MOE), Department of Environment (DOE), and National Disaster Management Organization (NDMO) are three stakeholders in the groundwater bioremediation problem in Iran. Based on the preferences of these stakeholders, the multi-objective optimization model tries to minimize: (1) cost; (2) sum of contaminant concentrations that violate standard; (3) contaminant plume fragmentation. The NSGA-II multi-objective optimization method gives Pareto-optimal solutions. A compromised solution is determined using fallback bargaining with impasse to achieve a consensus among the stakeholders. In this study, two different approaches are investigated and compared based on two different domains for locations of injection and extraction wells. At the first approach, a limited number of predefined locations is considered according to previous similar studies. At the second approach, all possible points in study area are investigated to find optimal locations, arrangement, and flow rate of injection and extraction wells. Involvement of the stakeholders, investigating all possible points instead of a limited number of locations for wells, and minimizing the contaminant plume fragmentation during bioremediation are new innovations in this research. Besides, the simulation period is divided into smaller time intervals for more efficient optimization. Image processing toolbox in MATLAB® software is utilized for calculation of the third objective function. In comparison with previous studies, cost is reduced using the proposed methodology. Dispersion of the contaminant plume is reduced in both presented approaches using the third objective function. Considering all possible points in the study area for determining the optimal locations of the wells in the second approach leads to more desirable results, i.e. decreasing the contaminant concentrations to a standard level and 20% to 40% cost reduction.

AB  - Literature and field study research highlight that transiting toward PSS means for many companies to either miss interesting business opportunities or to bet on the wrong solution concept. Early stage assessment activities play a crucial role in this respect, guiding the selection of a value-adding PSS while preventing commitment of resources on poor design alternatives. Emerging from empirical studies in the manufacturing industry, the paper highlights the need for systematic procedures, tools and metrics able to encompass customer satisfaction together with the producer's value perspective in such assessment. The paper proposes a 2 step assessment method based on the Importance Performance Analysis (IPA) matrix enabling the integration of customer and provider value and supporting early stage PSS design decision making. Verification activities highlight the positive implications of balancing the trade-off between customer and provider value during the PSS assessment phase.

AB  - Urban freight transport (UFT) is fundamental to the liveability of our cities, but it also contributes to the unsustainability of the same cities. Local authorities are primarily responsible for governing urban areas and implement different measures to regulate UFT. Measures often fail as they do not reach their intended goal and sometimes even produce adverse effects. One of the primary causes is that prior to implementation, the different stakeholders affecting and being affected by the UFT are not sufficiently involved. In this study, the multi-actor multi-criteria analysis (MAMCA) is applied ex-ante to evaluate to what extent different measures contribute to the objectives of different stakeholders. A municipality in Belgium, experiencing a lot of traffic, is used as a case study. Regulating UFT is in this case further complicated due to multi-level governance with different jurisdictions over infrastructure. To our knowledge, there are no similar UFT studies in a multi-level governance context. Results show that all proposed measures are an improvement for all stakeholders compared to the current situation. Future implementation of measures in this context is discussed.

KW  - Dependence modelling
AB  - Many applications in decision making under uncertainty and probabilistic risk assessment require the assessment of multiple, dependent uncertain quantities, so that in addition to marginal distributions, interdependence needs to be modelled in order to properly understand the overall risk. Nevertheless, relevant historical data on dependence information are often not available or simply too costly to obtain. In this case, the only sensible option is to elicit this uncertainty through the use of expert judgements. In expert judgement studies, a structured approach to eliciting variables of interest is desirable so that their assessment is methodologically robust. One of the key decisions during the elicitation process is the form in which the uncertainties are elicited. This choice is subject to various, potentially conflicting, desiderata related to e.g. modelling convenience, coherence between elicitation parameters and the model, combining judgements, and the assessment burden for the experts. While extensive and systematic guidance to address these considerations exists for single variable uncertainty elicitation, for higher dimensions very little such guidance is available. Therefore, this paper offers a systematic review of the current literature on eliciting dependence. The literature on the elicitation of dependence parameters such as correlations is presented alongside commonly used dependence models and experience from case studies. From this, guidance about the strategy for dependence assessment is given and gaps in the existing research are identified to determine future directions for structured methods to elicit dependence.
