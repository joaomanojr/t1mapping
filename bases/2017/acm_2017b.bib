abstract = {Water is at the heart of 'Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)' set by United Nations - with an objective to balance the three dimensions of sustainable development: Environment, Social and Economic - and is indirectly associated with the success of all the other Goals. But, with changing climatic patterns, untimely rains, prolonged dry spells, depleting ground water and drought making every drop of water extremely precious, the need of the hour is to gauge and work towards the major aspects of water harvesting - 'Catchment'. Water Harvesting must be a key element of any strategy to bring an end to India's perennial swings between drought and flood and to meet the following SDGs for sustained development. This study presents a structured and meticulous approach, wielding 'Geospatial Analytics' to identify the prospective locations for Water Harvesting in arid and semi-arid parts of the country for sustainable development. This paper is structured as follows. Section 1 describes the background and motivation for this idea. Section 2 details out the objective. In section 3 we present the 'Literature Survey' on the work that has already been carried out in this field. While section 4 discerns our area of study, Section 5 provides process flow starting from Data gathering, Data extraction, Data pre-processing, Model selection and Multi Criteria Decision Making (Model Application). In Section 6, we present and validate our experimental results achieved using the proposed methodology. Section 7 concludes our study followed by Section 8 on Recommendations for future enhancements and next steps.},

abstract = {In the context of intelligent digital learning, we propose an agent-based recommender system that aims to help learners overcome their gaps by suggesting relevant learning resources. The main idea is to provide them with appropriate support in order to make their learning experience more effective. To this end we design an agent-based cooperative system where autonomous agents are able to update recommendation data and to improve the recommender outcome on behalf of their past experiences in the learning platform.},

abstract = {When design problems are multiobjective, graphical representation of the optimization results has a great importance in the analysis and decision making steps. This paper wants to show some of the main features of an interactive tool for multiobjective Pareto front and set analysis. The tool is built in Matlab and uses the Level Diagram representation.It also allows to compare different Pareto fronts and sets. This is especially interesting when the designer wants to compare different kinds of solutions to the same problem. Each type of solution is known as concept. For each concept a particular problem of multiobjective optimization is proposed and its Pareto front and set obtained. Although these concepts are usually parametrized in a different decision space, the objectives to be optimized are the same and therefore they can be compared in the same objectives framework.The interactive tool also supplies the possibility to change colors, shapes and sizes of the points in the representation. These capabilities help the user to understand the relations among the different plots of the Level Diagrams. The norm used in Level Diagrams for axes synchronization offers different points of view about the possible solutions. Therefore, the tool also provides support for easily changing these norms. Level Diagrams with all these extended capabilities are a valuable tool in the decision making process.},

abstract = {Pattern discovery is one of the most important tasks in data mining, many works are developed in this context where we can notice the problem of 'pattern explosion' which make taking a decision about useful pattern more difficult. the goal of our study is to make an improvement in the process of extracting useful patterns from data, called also 'pattern mining'. The aim of this article is to propose an approach to select useful patterns from a set of patterns by using multicriteria approach. To do this, we will use the famous multicriteria analysis method called ELECTRE, particularly ELECTRE I, in order to have a selection of the most relevant patterns according to proposed criteria.},
