abstract = {Utilizing multi-criteria decision analysis as an alternative to traditional screening processes for GIS modeling for landfill site selection (LSS) has attracted significant interest in recent years because of its time and cost savings and its ability to achieve better validation and accuracy. This paper surveys the developments in the modeling of LSS using geographic information systems (GIS) on the basis of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in the past two decades from 1997 to 2014. Emphasis is placed on the third and fifth stages of the overall applied methodology (selection of weights and decision rules), as well as on the efficiency of the LSS models. From the review, the strengths and limitations of using MCDA for LSS modeling via GIS are identified. Moreover, artificial neural networks instead of MCDA can be used as a new approach in the third and fifth stages of LSS models to enhance validation and accuracy.},

abstract = {Water is at the heart of 'Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)' set by United Nations - with an objective to balance the three dimensions of sustainable development: Environment, Social and Economic - and is indirectly associated with the success of all the other Goals. But, with changing climatic patterns, untimely rains, prolonged dry spells, depleting ground water and drought making every drop of water extremely precious, the need of the hour is to gauge and work towards the major aspects of water harvesting - 'Catchment'. Water Harvesting must be a key element of any strategy to bring an end to India's perennial swings between drought and flood and to meet the following SDGs for sustained development. This study presents a structured and meticulous approach, wielding 'Geospatial Analytics' to identify the prospective locations for Water Harvesting in arid and semi-arid parts of the country for sustainable development. This paper is structured as follows. Section 1 describes the background and motivation for this idea. Section 2 details out the objective. In section 3 we present the 'Literature Survey' on the work that has already been carried out in this field. While section 4 discerns our area of study, Section 5 provides process flow starting from Data gathering, Data extraction, Data pre-processing, Model selection and Multi Criteria Decision Making (Model Application). In Section 6, we present and validate our experimental results achieved using the proposed methodology. Section 7 concludes our study followed by Section 8 on Recommendations for future enhancements and next steps.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is a wide architecture based on diverse models for providing different services of software and hardware. Cloud computing paradigm attracts different users because of its several benefits such as high resource elasticity, expense reduction, scalability and simplicity which provide significant preserving in terms of investment and work force. However, the new approaches introduced by the cloud, related to computation outsourcing, distributed resources, multi-tenancy concept, high dynamism of the model, data warehousing and the nontransparent style of cloud increase the security and privacy concerns and makes building and handling trust among cloud service providers and consumers a critical security challenge. This paper proposes a new approach to improve security of data in cloud computing. It suggests a classification model to categorize data before being introduced into a suitable encryption system according to the category. Since data in cloud has not the same sensitivity level, encrypting it with the same algorithms can lead to a lack of security or of resources. By this method we try to optimize the resources consumption and the computation cost while ensuring data confidentiality.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role in connecting the physical world with the cyber world through new services and seamless interconnection between heterogeneous devices. Such heterogeneous devices tend to generate a massive volume of Big Data. However, exploiting green schemes for IoT is still a challenge since IoT attains a large scale and becomes more multifaceted, the current trends of analyzing Big Data are not directly applicable to it. Similarly, achieving green IoT through the use of 5G also poses new challenges when it comes to transferring huge volume of data in an efficient way. To address the challenges above, this paper presents a scheme for human- enabled green IoT in 5G network. Green IoT is achieved by grouping mobile nodes in a cluster. Also, a mobility management model is designed that helps in triggering efficient handover and selecting optimal networks based on multi-criteria decision modeling. Afterward, we design a network architecture that integrates green IoT with 5G network. Moreover, the 5G network architecture is supported by proposed protocol stack, which maps Internet Protocol (IP), Medium Access Protocol (MAC), and Location identifiers (LOC). The proposed scheme is also implemented using C programming language to validate mobility model in 5G, regarding cost, energy, and Quality of Service.},

abstract = {IT infrastructure and applications in enterprise systems started with traditional client-server architecture and have gone through key paradigm shifts in infrastructure, software, enterprise, and service architectures to current age of cloud computing and internet of everything. Using strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats and analytical hierarchy process of multi-criteria decision making frameworks together, various aspects of cloud computing characteristics related to opportunities, benefits, costs, value and risks can be understood in a more detailed way and can be ranked. This article has combined these two frameworks for the ranking of various business intelligence architects for cloud computing by using 'business automation with sustainable hedging for information risks' framework for cloud computing from conservative perspective where risk relevancy attracts the prime focus. The results have shown that moving operational business intelligence is the best business intelligence architecture for cloud computing as its strengths are more than inherent risks as has become evident by using this approach.},

Remanufacturing which aims is to take care of used or damaged product in the purpose of returning it like new product, lead many researchers to study the integration of this reverse flow in the process of the forward supply chain. The resulting models are difficult and complex to solve and optimize, hence the need to integrate a strong and efficient method such as Metaheuristics to solve those complex optimization problems. The purpose of this study is to review the published literature on the issues of reverse logistics and remanufacturing, and classified these papers by the type of metaheuristic used.

We believe that affect changes development in a significant way especially for agile development, which requires close collaboration. We postulate that the structuring of a decision will engage a larger audience eliciting full participation by actors like the customer who are not necessarily accustomed to a development environment. Further, we believe that the structuring of the decision process and the involvement of a larger pool of actors will reduce negative affect, thus enabling a faster, better empowering set of decisions that ultimately will result in higher quality software products and a lower development time.},

abstract = {The Social Web supports and fosters social interactions by means of different social media, which allow the spread of the so called User-Generated Content (UGC). In this context, characterized by the absence of trusted third parties that verify the reliability of the sources and the believability of the content generated, the issue of assessing the credibility of the information diffused by means of social media is receiving increasing attention. In the literature, this issue has been mainly tackled as a classification problem; information is categorized into genuine and fake, usually by implementing or applying classifiers that consider multiple kinds of features (mainly textual and non-textual) to be evaluated in terms of credibility.In this article, unlike prior research, textual features are considered separately with respect to other kinds of features during the classification process. In particular, an Ensemble Method that combines the results produced by two text classifiers and the ones returned by another classifier acting on non-textual features is proposed. This allows to have better results with respect to the use of a single classifier on multiple features together. The effectiveness of the Ensemble Method has been assessed in the context of review sites, by means of a labeled dataset gathered from the Yelp.com site, where on-line reviews are already classified as recommended and not recommended.},

abstract = {In rank-aware processing, user preferences are typically represented by a numeric weight per data attribute, collectively forming a weight vector. The score of an option (data record) is defined as the weighted sum of its individual attributes. The highest-scoring options across a set of alternatives (dataset) are shortlisted for the user as the recommended ones. In that setting, the user input is a vector (equivalently, a point) in a d-dimensional preference space, where d is the number of data attributes. In this paper we study the problem of determining in which regions of the preference space the weight vector should lie so that a given option (focal record) is among the top-k score-wise. In effect, these regions capture all possible user profiles for which the focal record is highly preferable, and are therefore essential in market impact analysis, potential customer identification, profile-based marketing, targeted advertising, etc. We refer to our problem as k-Shortlist Preference Region identification (kSPR), and exploit its computational geometric nature to develop a framework for its efficient (and exact) processing. Using real and synthetic benchmarks, we show that our most optimized algorithm outperforms by three orders of magnitude a competitor we constructed from previous work on a different problem.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no work that both summarizes recent progress and suggests future directions for this emerging research area. To remedy this situation, we provide a systematic treatment of the recent developments in data-driven disaster management. Specifically, we first present a general overview of the requirements and system architectures of disaster management systems and then summarize state-of-the-art data-driven techniques that have been applied on improving situation awareness as well as in addressing users’ information needs in disaster management. We also discuss and categorize general data-mining and machine-learning techniques in disaster management. Finally, we recommend several research directions for further investigations.},

Firstly, based on the basic operational laws which are defined for the intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy numbers in intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy sets, the weighted geometric operator and the weighted averaging operator of the intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy numbers are built. Secondly, the novel approach to MADM with intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy sets is put forward. In this approach, the general membership, general non-membership, and general hesitancy degree are calculated of alternatives, then the score function is designed by cross-entropy. The best alternative is obtained according to the score function. Furthermore, an illustrative example is provided to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, the paper gives a conclusion of this paper and make a brief plan for further researches.},

Despite the fact that most of the existing trust systems consider several QoS attributes for trust computing, none of them did consider the correlation that may exist among these attributes. However, we demonstrate in this paper that the integration of correlation between QoS attributes in trust computing significantly helps to solve many issues such as predicting missing assessment, detecting malicious feedbacks and improving the accuracy of trust values. The main goal of this paper is to show the significance of correlation between those attributes for trust computing. To do that, we propose combining both the popular Na\"{\i}ve Bayes model and the n-gram Markov model to design a more efficient trust model for cloud environments. Our proposed trust model also takes into account the user's requirements, aggregates both the qualitative and quantitative assessment, and considers several sources when computing cloud services' trust values. Experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms the traditional Na\"{\i}ve Bayes trust models.},

We further extend our work for triaging Non-reproducible (NR) bugs, the bugs for which the developer faces difficulty in reproducing. However, certain fraction of these bugs gets fixed later. We propose a novel prediction model, NRFixer to predict the fixability of bug reports marked as NR. In the future, we plan to work on bug report assignment for fixable NR bugs using Visheshagya and W8Prioritizer.

An evaluation with 87 participants shows that ConsensUs helps individuals identify points of disagreement within groups and leads people to align their scores more with the group opinion.

abstract = {Diagnosis and self-healing anomalies are an important as pectin the operations for data centers and for computing in utility clouds. Data centers which offer greater size along with heterogeneous and complex applications, software and workload systems such as anomaly/fault detection require automatic operation with runtime self-healing. Moreover, they must do so without requirement of having previous knowledge regarding normal and/or anomalous performance. Diagnosis must function for levels of different abstraction such as hardware and software, along with multiple time-series metrics for the use in environments like cloud computing. By classifying and analyzing metrics that are qualitative can offer new methods for anomaly and fault diagnosis for their distribution instead of simply providing individual metric thresholds. Categorical counterparts (binning) and normal distribution are used as a measurement that captures the extent of the distributions for concentration or dispersion so that raw metric data can be gathered across the cloud stack to create a time-series for entropy (e.g. symptoms).These symptoms can be organized hierarchically and across many cloud-ecosystems to increase scalability. These symptoms can also address the uncertainty in anomaly data. This contribution is possible since the multi-value decision diagram (MDD) for the structure of Multiple-Valued Logic (MVL) is shown to be highly efficient in terms of rapid analytical performance and is adapted to integrate the effects of measurements for multiple values. Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) with an influence diagram (ID) are used to create time-series diagnosis technique to categorize and detect anomalies/faults during runtime to approximate the influence of each self-healing system component as to systems functioning and reliability. For the utility cloud service scenarios, the results of experiment show the viability of the presented approach. With an average of 0.89% improvement in the accuracy of anomaly diagnosis on threshold methods and an average improvement of 0.04% for false alarm rates with the near-optimum threshold method the presented approach outperforms other methods.},

abstract = {The United States Coast Guard (USCG) plans the world-wide operations of its ships, referred to as cutters. Rule-based decision making mechanisms, the primary planning tools, are aimed at ensuring adequate time inport for maintenance, stand-by, and generalized assignments for at-sea deployments to geographic regions. This approach is problematic. Stochastic events are becoming increasingly costly. In 2013, Coast Guard cutters suffered nearly four times the normally allocated amount of operational days lost to unplanned repairs. Additionally, the predominant metric used by schedulers is the amount of time a cutter is focused on a single, primary mission. The reality of multi-mission operations is that unplanned emergency missions often supersede planned, routine missions. Furthermore, mission results contribute to multiple strategic goals, though to varying extents based on geographic area. We propose a comprehensive multi-mission schedule evaluation mechanism that measures productivity, given limited Coast Guard resources, across a spectrum of current and future scenarios.},

abstract = {Multicast communication (1-to-many) is common in parallel architectures and emerging areas such as neuromorphic computing. However, there is very limited research in supporting multicast in asynchronous NoCs. This paper proposes a new parallel multicast asynchronous NoC with 2D-mesh topology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general-purpose asynchronous NoC to support multicast in 2D meshes. A critical feature of this NoC is the use of a new continuous-time replication strategy, where the flits of a multicast packet are routed through the distinct outputs of the router according to each output's own rate, in parallel and in continuous time. This unique asynchronous continuous-time replication, not discretized to clock cycles, can handle subtle variations in network congestion and exploit "sub-cycle" differentials in operating speeds. A new continuous-time multi-way read (CMR) buffer is proposed to enable this replication strategy. Only a single CMR buffer is used per input port, with multiple independent read pointers, which are accessed by different outputs. For diverse multicast benchmarks, the new parallel multicast network achieved significant latency and throughput gains over a serial baseline. Moderate energy overhead was seen for one benchmark with a small multicast portion, but major reductions were achieved for higher amounts of multicast. Interestingly, consistent latency improvements were observed for unicast, in spite of the extra instrumentation. Experiments on isolated multicast packet transmissions also showed over an order-of-magnitude improvement in delivery time.},
