AB  - In construction projects, the large portions of construction activities are carried out by subcontractor companies; hence the success of a project directly depends on the performance of the selected subcontractors. However, general contractors generally select their subcontractors on the basis of the low bid price, which may lead to work with unqualified subcontractors. This situation usually results in additional costs. Therefore, general contractors should thoroughly measure and evaluate the performances of subcontractor candidates during the selection process. In this study, a practical and systematic performance measurement framework, which is based on the key performance indicators (KPIs) model, is developed to measure the managerial capability of subcontractors. For this purpose, first, the relevant literature was reviewed, and 94 KPIs were identified to measure the managerial capability of subcontractor candidates. Then, these 94 KPIs were categorized into three main groups namely: (1) KPIs Affecting General Performance, (2) KPIs Affecting Experience and Past Relations, and (3) KPIs Affecting Communication Skills. After identifying and categorizing the KPIs, 58 indicators were eliminated considering the characteristics of the Turkish construction industry. In the next stage, a questionnaire survey was designed and delivered to large-scale 40 Turkish contractors, who predominantly do business in international markets. The reliability and ranking analyses were performed on the collected data to determine the importance levels of the identified KPIs. The findings of this study were used to develop the managerial capability performance measurement framework.

AB  - Ecosystems are essential in providing multiple services to society. However, understanding ecosystem services (ESS) in terms of spatial distribution and trade-offs still remains a challenge for landscape planners and natural resource managers. In this paper, we analyzed the supply of a set of ESS – carbon storage, soil erosion protection, biodiversity, and recreation – within the landscape surrounding the city of Bari in Southern Italy. Through an analysis of this landscape, which includes natural protected areas, such as Natura 2000 Network sites, national and regional parks and nature reserves, and in view of the recent Fitness Check of the Nature Directives, we aimed to provide answers to the following questions: (i) Where are the areas of high and low supply of individual ecosystem services located?; (ii) Where do ecosystem service trade-offs (i.e., ‘hotspots’ and ‘coldspots’) occur?; and (iii) To what extent are ecosystem service hotspots and coldspots located within or outside of natural protected areas? Results show that most of the landscape in the study area supplied at least one of the selected ESS and that ESS hotspots were mostly located within forested and/or natural areas. Hotspots occupied 8.0% of the total landscape, with 23.7% located in natural protected areas. Coldspots were scarce and equal to 2.4%; they constituted only 0.1% of natural protected areas. Almost all of the landscape (89.6%) consists of intermediate areas (i.e., between hotspots and coldspots); 76.2% of natural protected areas consists of intermediate areas. This latter finding is relevant because the high intermediate classes are potentially high-performing areas, which lie mainly on the borders of protected spaces; they can positively influence ecological processes and thus enhance a wide-ranging provision of ESS. Our results highlight the importance of analyzing landscapes to facilitate the selection of priority areas where management efforts would yield maximum benefits.

AB  - Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize ultrasound/ultraviolet-assisted oxidative desulfurization in an airlift reactor. Ultrasonic waves were incorporated in a novel-geometry reactor to investigate the synergistic effects of sono-chemistry and enhanced gas-liquid mass transfer. Non-hydrotreated kerosene containing sulfur and aromatic compounds was chosen as a case study. Experimental runs were conducted based on a face-centered central composite design and analyzed using RSM. The effects of two categorical factors, i.e., ultrasound and ultraviolet irradiation and two numerical factors, i.e., superficial gas velocity and oxidation time were investigated on two responses, i.e., desulfurization and de-aromatization yields. Two-factor interaction (2FI) polynomial model was developed for the responses and the desirability function associate with overlay graphs was applied to find optimum conditions. The results showed enhancement in desulfurization ability corresponds to more reduction in aromatic content of kerosene in each combination. Based on desirability approach and certain criteria considered for desulfurization/de-aromatization, the optimal desulfurization and de-aromatization yields of 91.7% and 48% were obtained in US/UV/O3/H2O2 combination, respectively.

AB  - This paper presents a self-learning decision making procedure for robust real-time train rescheduling in case of disturbances. The procedure is applicable to aperiodic timetables of mixed-tracked networks and it consists of three steps. The first two are executed in real-time and provide the rescheduled timetable, while the third one is executed offline and guarantees the self-learning part of the method. In particular, in the first step, a robust timetable is determined, which is valid for a finite time horizon. This robust timetable is obtained solving a mixed integer linear programming problem aimed at finding the optimal compromise between two objectives: the minimization of the delays of the trains and the maximization of the robustness of the timetable. In the second step, a merging procedure is first used to join the obtained timetable with the nominal one. Then, a heuristics is applied to identify and solve all conflicts eventually arising after the merging procedure. Finally, in the third step an offline cross-efficiency fuzzy Data Envelopment Analysis technique is applied to evaluate the efficiency of the rescheduled timetable in terms of delays minimization and robustness maximization when different relevance weights (defining the compromise between the two optimization objectives) are used in the first step. The procedure is thus able to determine appropriate relevance weights to employ when disturbances of the same type affect again the network. The railway service provider can take advantage of this procedure to automate, optimize, and expedite the rescheduling process. Moreover, thanks to the self-learning capability of the procedure, the quality of the rescheduling is improved at each reapplication of the method. The technique is applied to a real data set related to a regional railway network in Southern Italy to test its effectiveness.

AB  - This paper presents Slovenian experiences related to a customized educational solution called EUREM (European Energy Manager) involving the training of energy experts in the field of energy efficiency. The EUREM training program is offered in 27 countries around the world and covers nearly all the energy-relevant issues that can arise in public and private companies. The final output of the practical training is a company-specific prefeasibility study that deals with energy weak points and energy efficiency measures that have a high implementation potential. The presented curriculum of the EUREM training program provides a solid basis for increasing the knowledge and skills of energy managers and was developed with an emphasis on practical experiences related to the deployment, demonstration, measurement and verification of energy-efficient solutions in industry and buildings. Regular surveys and communications involving former training participants indicate that the EUREM training program has stimulated Slovenian energy managers to make significant energy savings in their companies. Around 55% of the Slovenian EUREM training participants confirmed that in addition to their energy concepts, they had also realized additional energy efficiency projects after they finished the training course. Based on the experience gained during the past 8 years of the training program's implementation in Slovenia we can conclude that the energy experts really appreciated their practical education and training with on-the-job support from professional coaches. The future challenges of the education and training program are related to follow-up activities, the development of interactive tools and the curriculum's customization to meet the constantly growing needs of energy experts from industry.

AB  - Saltwater intrusion (SWI) represents a threat to coastal aquifers worldwide by rendering groundwater quality not viable for its intended purposes. Therefore, understanding SWI impacts is indispensable for informed decision-making on aquifer management. Despite advances in methods to assess the impact of SWI, it remains challenging to select appropriate methods that are effective, timely, and affordable under the influence of a range of factors including aquifer characteristics, hydro-geochemical dynamics, shoreline geomorphology, biochemical reactions, and data availability among others. This study examines commonly used methods that assess the impact of SWI towards the development of an assessment framework in coastal aquifers underlying densely populated urban areas. The methods were selected using complexity-functionality criteria and then tested at a pilot aquifer by coupling Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) and Multi-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of the methods and identify elements of the framework. The framework proved functional in synthesizing parametric results, assessing the dynamics of SWI and quantifying its potential impact, as well as providing an effective platform for informed impact assessment and planning for sustainable exploitation of coastal aquifers.

AB  - The construction industry has been evolving to embrace sustainability. This has highlighted the necessity to inspect sustainable performances throughout the post-construction building lifecycle. Application of relevant Building Management Systems (BMS) to achieve this goal is essential. Likewise, it is vital to balance the maximization of building energy efficiency and users’ desired level of comfort while employing an efficient BMS for sustainable maintenance of facility operations. The high probability of inaccurate manual building inspections plus the lack of real-time input of dynamic factors urges development of automated BMS. Therefore, Building Information Modelling (BIM) plays a key role towards automation in construction and corresponding management systems. Despite the nD capability of BIM enabling its potential practice during building lifecycle phases, designers-contractors focused primarily on the application of BIM during design-construction management stages. Moreover, integration of knowledge management systems empower handling and sharing of building maintenance information during the building lifecycle. This is essential for post-construction sustainable performance. Focusing on building energy efficiency, this article has reviewed 96 papers and suggests engagement of an Integrated Knowledge-based Building Management System using nD BIM applications (BIM-IKBMS) during the post-construction building lifecycle to advance the successful implementation of sustainable building performances.

AB  - Learning lessons from near-miss reports is a well-known procedure in various high-hazard industries. The construction industry tends to adopt near-miss management systems, but the procedure is relatively new and has not yet been fully explored or understood. Although the management of near-miss reporting systems in construction has been investigated, no effort appears to have been made to suggest a methodology for technically investigating the content of near-miss reported events. This paper reports a study that implemented both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods for a structured investigation of tower-crane-related incident stories (near misses and accidents). The study began by collecting a large number of incident stories (51 accidents and 161 near misses) that were qualitatively analyzed to form an incident database that served as raw material for further quantitative analyses. The database structure definitions contained categories, which in turn contained variables, such as defining the event severity outcomes on a six-point scale from ‘1’ – near miss to ‘6’ – fatality. Further quantitative analysis suggests comparing groups of similar or identical incidents. The groups (clusters) were established by implementing k-means clustering based on the database definitions as variables. The relative risk potential of each cluster was then quantified by comparing each cluster’s severity outcome occurrences to those of the other clusters and to the entire database as well. Findings from the analyses suggest that technical failures are the most hazardous risk factors within the tower crane domain.

AB  - Today, the technical challenges for estimating closure time and cost are two significant parts of mine closure management. In this paper, a simulation-based framework is established to determine the probable open-pit mine closure times and mine closure costs. The model incorporates price uncertainty into the probable mine closure time. To estimate the closure cost more accurately, the Hutchison's technique is modified using the predefined mine closure times. This technique uses Monte Carlo simulation method and decision tree analysis to estimate mine closure cost in a probabilistic manner. The proposed framework is applied in a 2D hypothetical geological block model. The results show that the model works well and it can be used in real cases.

AB  - The endocrine system is a complex, interconnected, multidimensional system that comprises a network of numerous tissues, organs, and organelles. To impact these hormonal systems, a chemical may need only to impact the system during the peak, critical developmental time window of exposure, in utero exposure, and persistent, longer term exposure measured in months, years, and even over the course of a lifetime. The endpoints cover developmental, organogenesis, cancer, metabolism, and complicated neural networks. In 1996, the United States Congress directed the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as stated in the 1996 amendments to the Food Quality Protection Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, to identify chemicals with the potential to interact with the endocrine system and, subsequently, to test those that may warrant additional longer term definitive tests for regulatory determinations. To this end, in 1998, the EPA had developed its Endocrine Disruption Screening Program (EDSP), which employs a two-tiered screening and testing approach; together in partnership with the global regulatory community, the Agency had taken up the charge to scientifically develop and validate test methods and issue endocrine test orders to screen and test >50 chemicals since 2009 for endocrine activity and adversity. And only recently has EPA issued its weight-of-evidence determinations for the initial list of 52 chemicals, which concludes that only 18 have been identified for further testing.EDSP Tiered Screening and Testing ApproachTier 1 Short-Term Screening Battery—intended to determine whether chemical substances have the potential to interact with the endocrine systemTier 2 Longer Term Reproduction Studies—to test chemical substances to determine the dose–response and apical endpoint for risk assessment purposes While the EPA EDSP has employed a two-tiered screening and testing approach, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has developed a five-level conceptual framework. Different from the EDSDP Tiered screening and testing, the conceptual framework is not responsive to legislative mandates and is not a regulatory decision-making framework. These five levels are populated with available endocrine specific and nonspecific assays, depending on the complexity of the test systems, and graded based on levels of economic investments.OECD Conceptual Framework•Level 1: Existing data and nontest information•Level 2: In vitro assays providing data about selected endocrine mechanisms/pathways, including mammalian and nonmammalian methods•Level 3: In vivo assays providing data about selected endocrine mechanisms/pathways•Level 4: In vivo assays providing data on adverse effects on endocrine-relevant endpoints•Level 5: In vivo assays providing more comprehensive data on adverse effects on endocrine-relevant endpoints over more extensive parts of the life cycle of the organism To date, there are >40 different ecological and mammalian assays included in the OECD Conceptual Framework, and there are additional assays being developed in other parts of the world for submission to OECD for validation and inclusion in the Endocrine Disruptor Testing Assessment considerations. Despite the volume and complexity of these existing test methods, as evident in the EDSP Tier 1 battery of assays, no single assay alone is capable of determining endocrine activity or adversity. It is done through the collective consideration of multiple assays, along a biological continuum, with the determination of complementarity and necessary redundancies that enhance the overall confidence of the assessment as to whether the chemical elicits an endocrine perturbation that is sufficient to lead to a subsequent adverse health outcome. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework is an organizing framework that allows the sophisticated integration of different data streams across various biological levels of organization. This framework allows for the simultaneous evaluation of both toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic relationships across and within species. As evident in the EDSP Tier 1 battery of assays and the OECD Conceptual Framework, the AOP concept is embedded in the logic of the assays selected in each Tier, for each endocrine pathway. Each AOP pathway starts with a molecular initiating event leading to effects at the tissue, organ, organism, and population levels. As the AOP concept is accepted in the regulatory risk assessment context and testing methods advance to shift from whole-animal systems to in vitro high-throughput methods, regulatory agencies will have to determine whether to remain committed to the traditional whole-animal, in vivo test methods that have been validated and globally accepted as being the only methods capable of testing the complex and interconnected endocrine systems, or whether there is sufficient knowledge of the AOP pathway to rely on in vitro methods that indicate that a molecular initiating event is sufficient and adequate for regulatory decision making. The weight-of-evidence (WOE) assessment of extant endocrine- and nonendocrine-specific assays will undoubtedly inform the regulatory risk assessment paradigm. These integrated, WOE decisions are dependent on the available scientific data (e.g., high throughput, in silico, in vitro, and in vivo) and dependent on the nature of the regulatory question set at the problem formulation stage. Different regulatory questions will have varying levels of “acceptable uncertainty”; a decision of when to prioritize a chemical for screening will be very different from the regulatory management decision of whether to register a new chemistry for use on food commodities. The regulatory context in which the question is being posed will often dictate the level of endocrine screening and testing that may be warranted, both from regulatory and research perspectives.

AB  - Presently, the usage of solar energy has increased with the advent of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and bypassing traditional energy sources such as fossil fuels. Government of India (GoI) is adopting various policy measures to promote diffusion of solar energy across the nation and has huge solar energy investment plans in near future. In this regard, selection of appropriate site for solar power installation is of prime concern. It is a critical issue that needs to be analyzed in depth for producing solar power efficiently because various key factors viz. social, technical, economic, environmental and political aspects are associated with it. Considering the fact that there are lots of factors which affect the solar farm site selection, it is imperative to organize them in a systematic hierarchy. In this direction, present study aims to select appropriate site in an Indian case using hybrid combination of two Multi Criteria Evaluation (MCE) methods- Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Present investigation reveals that Sonepat is the best location for solar installation followed by Rohtak, Chandigarh, Gurgaon and Hisar in state of Haryana, India. The purpose of the investigation is to present an effective, efficient and systematic decision support framework which might help policy planners in the evaluation process of appropriate solar farm site selection in India.

AB  - Smartphones are increasingly used all over the world. However, the effects of smartphone design features on smartphone acceptance and usage behavior are not well known. Thus, in this study, a questionnaire was constructed to identify design feature factors that are critical to the acceptance and usage behavior of smartphones. A total of 842 participants completed the questionnaire. Acceptance was measured on the basis of perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU), and intention to use (IU). Results of exploratory factor analysis indicated that users’ preference for smartphones consisted of the following nine factors: Interface element design, Smartphone characteristics, Physical characteristics, Touch feedback, Operation design, Display screen, Connectivity, Button, and Application. Results of hierarchical regression analysis indicated that Smartphone characteristics, Touch feedback, and Display screen significantly influenced PEOU.

The usage behavior of smartphones was significantly related to Connectivity, Interface element design, PEOU, PU, and IU. The proposed model comprising demographic variables, design features, and acceptance-related variables could explain 76.5% of the variance in the usage behavior of smartphones.

AB  - Reliability allocation is one of the most critical tasks in system reliability design, the result of which directly influences a product’s quality and the robustness of the system. Traditionally, reliability allocation has used the feasibility-of-objectives (FOO) method to perform system reliability allocation at the beginning of the product design stage. However, the FOO method has several shortcomings; for example, it requires that the value of the reliability allocation factors be single linguistic variables, and it does not consider the ordered weight of the reliability allocation factors. To solve this issue, this paper integrates the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets and minimal variance OWGA weights to effect flexible allocation of system reliability. To verify the efficacy of the proposed approach, an example of reliability allocation in a transceiver system is provided to illustrate its application, and the results of this method are compared with those of the FOO and fuzzy allocation methods. We conclude that the proposed approach is more accurate and performs flexible allocation of system reliability.

AB  - The exploration of geothermal regions is the first step for the use of these resources. This paper attempts to incorporate the concept of risk into the GIS-based analysis for generating geothermal prospectivity maps via Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) approach. The use of OWA-based approach provides a model that generates geothermal prospectivity maps with different pessimistic or optimistic strategies. The results indicate that the values of wells percentages in high favorite areas for the most pessimistic and optimistic strategies are 85% and 100%, respectively. Regarding the prediction rate, the results show that the rate for the most pessimistic and optimistic strategies are 18.55 and 1.18, respectively.

AB  - The traditional distribution planning problem in a supply chain has often been studied mainly with a focus on economic benefits. The growing concern about the effects of anthropogenic pollutions has forced researchers and supply chain practitioners to address the socio-environmental concerns. This research study focuses on incorporating the environmental impact on route design problem. In this work, the aim is to integrate both the objectives, namely economic cost and emission cost reduction for a capacitated multi-depot green vehicle routing problem. The proposed models are a significant contribution to the field of research in green vehicle routing problem at the operational level. The formulated integer linear programming model is solved for a set of small scale instances using LINGO solver. A computationally efficient Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based meta-heuristic is developed for solving both small scale and large scale problem instances in reasonable amount of time. For solving large scale instances, the performance of the proposed ACO based meta-heuristic is improved by integrating it with a variable neighbourhood search.

AB  - One task that catering services for high-speed railways (CSHRs) must accomplish is to identify and evaluate potential service stations before the design phase of the distribution system. Fuzzy quality function deployment (F-QFD) is one approach for processing the evaluation scheme by translating the basic requirements described in vague terms into actionable alternatives. However, fuzzy importance ratings obtained using F-QFD might be misleading because the approach does not consider the random fluctuations of the fuzzy importance ratings. This paper first proposes a two-phase robust F-QFD process that is integrated with a robust analysis to consider how the QFD process can interact with both the fuzziness and the randomness found in real-world management. Two indicators that measure absolute and relative robustness are proposed. Second, following the mean-end-chain concept, this paper considers the close relationship between the two phases by developing a set of robustness-oriented fuzzy goal programming (RFGP) models to determine the locations of potential service stations. Two robustness indicators are introduced into the two-phase RFGP models to mitigate the adverse effect of random fluctuations. To address the fuzzy and binary variables in the model of phase 2, a hybrid cross-entropy method (HCEA) is developed. The overall framework is termed two-phase robust F-QFD based on the mean-end-chain (MEC) concept (R2-F-QFD-MEC). A series of computational experiments demonstrate both the effectiveness of the framework and the benefits of the robustness-oriented F-QFD. A case study regarding 33 potential service stations along the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed corridor is used to demonstrate the applicability of the method.

KW  - Sustainability criteria
AB  - Modular construction has been recognized as one of the primary methods for sustainable off-site construction in the recent past. However, in a given building project, the process of selecting a suitable construction method among different options is still made based on anecdotal evidence. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate the life cycle sustainability of different construction methods. The sustainability evaluation criteria (SEC) comprise the triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability categories, i.e., environmental, economic, and social, in which each category includes numerous sustainability performance indicators (SPI) associated with different life cycle phases of a building. The most significant step for comparative assessment of the life cycle sustainability of buildings is to develop suitable SPIs. In this paper, a methodology is used to identify and select the appropriate SPIs for life cycle sustainability evaluation of modular and conventional construction. Through a comprehensive literature review, 33 TBL SPIs were identified to address the life cycle sustainability performance of buildings. In order to investigate the applicability (importance) of the identified sustainability indicators when comparing the sustainability of modular and conventional buildings, a survey was designed and conducted. Subsequently, the construction professionals' perceptions of the applicability of these sustainability indicators were captured on a 5-point Likert scale. The reliability of questionnaire was analyzed using Cronbach's alpha measure. Then, all the SPIs were ranked based on their severity index (SI) values ranging between 20 and 100% correspond to a severity scale from “very low” to “extremely high” importance levels. All the SPIs were ranked under the overall TBL SPIs as well as within their associated sustainability categories. The analyses showed that 33% of the environmental SPIs, 67% of the economic SPIs, and 42% of the social SPIs were rated equal to or greater than “high” on severity scale (i.e., Severity Index ≥75%). The economic dimension of sustainability is still the governing concern of the construction industry practitioners. Moreover, the results revealed that attention to the social dimension of sustainability is increasing compared to the environmental dimension. This paper contributes to the current body of knowledge by highlighting the most applicable indicators for comparing and contrasting the sustainability of modular and conventional construction.

AB  - In order to respond to a call for tenders, bidders must define and evaluate potential solutions, based upon the specifications of customer’s requirements and their capabilities (skills, existing solutions, resources … etc.). The definition and the evaluation of potential solutions are not trivial activities. The lack of relevant information makes the evaluation imprecise and uncertain. Therefore bidders choose the most suitable solution based upon the standard indicators (cost, performance and lead time) and their subjective feeling. Unfortunately, this may leads to the choice of unfeasible solution regarding customer’s expectations (cost, performance and delivery time). Therefore, the aim of this paper is twofold: (i) first, to clarify the notion of imprecision and uncertainty in the evaluation of potential solutions; and (ii) second, to propose two Confidence Indexes (CI) in order to take into account uncertainty in offer elaboration. The first one (CIS) characterizes the confidence in the technical system solution and the second one (CIP) the confidence in the implementation process of the technical system. The proposed CIS and CIP will enable bidders to choose the most relevant solution not only based upon the standard indicators but also considering the confidence in the potential solutions.

AB  - The complex chemical process is a high pollution and high energy consumption industrial process. Therefore, it is very important to analyze and evaluate the energy and environment efficiency of the complex chemical process. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to evaluate the relative effectiveness of decision-making units (DMUs). However, the traditional DEA method usually cannot genuinely distinguish the effective and inefficient DMU due to its extreme or unreasonable weight distribution of input and output variables. Therefore, this paper proposes an energy and environment efficiency analysis method based on an improved environment DEA cross-model (DEACM) method. The inputs of the complex chemical process are divided into energy and non-energy inputs. Meanwhile, the outputs are divided into desirable and undesirable outputs. And then the energy and environment performance index (EEPI) based on the cross evaluation is used to represent the overall performance of each DMU. Moreover, the improvement direction of energy-saving and carbon emission reduction of each inefficiency DMU is quantitatively obtained based on the self-evaluation model of the improved environment DEACM. The results show that the improved environment DEACM method has a better effective discrimination than the original DEA method by analyzing the energy and environment efficiency of the ethylene production process in complex chemical processes, and it can obtain the potential of energy-saving and carbon emission reduction of ethylene plants, especially the improvement direction of inefficient DMUs to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emission.

AB  - Selecting the most suitable supplier regarding to the environmental competencies is one of the main issues for companies and organizations. To address the issue, the group decision-making methodologies are well known approaches which could help decision makers (DMs) for evaluating the green supplier selection problems. In this study, a new model based on group decision-making approach is introduced under novel compromise ranking method and interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) for the green supplier selection problems. In the proposed approach, the assessment criteria are provided by DMs based on linguistic terms which are converted to interval type-2 fuzzy elements. In this respect, decision makers' weights are computed based on an extended interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS method considering the priority experts' opinions about the relative significance of criteria, and also a new ranking index is presented respecting to interval type-2 fuzzy Hamming distance measure to ranking potential alternatives. Hence, a real case study is considered to indicate the applicability of the proposed approach. In addition, results from the proposed approach are compared with the existing method in literature in order to illustrate the validation of proposed model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is prepared to identify and determine the effects of different DMs' weights on ranking results. Results show that the proposed approach is an effective and practical decision tool for green supplier selection problems in fuzzy environment.

AB  - This work proposes a multi-objective optimization model to design a sustainable multi-period second generation biomass-to-bioethanol supply chain under multiple uncertainties. The objective is to simultaneously maximize the economic, environmental, and social performance. The strategic decisions such as land allocation for switchgrass cultivation, biorefinery locations and capacities, and the biomass-to-bioethanol conversion pathway are determined for each planning period which are staggered across the entire planning horizon. The augmented ε–constraint method is used to trade-off among the competing objectives and to obtain feasible solutions that achieve desired levels of sustainability. In order to solve the proposed stochastic optimization model efficiently and effectively, this work proposes a solution approach involving sequential application of a modified Sample Average Approximation method and Benders decomposition. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mathematical model and its impact on land usage and sustainability.

AB  - Since their introduction in 1994, more and more genetically modified (GM) crops are grown worldwide and introduced in food or feed products. In the European Union (EU), the production, trade and marketing of GM products is strictly regulated, but the situation is becoming more complex due to the increasing number and complexity of GM crops, and asynchronic approval procedures with the major GM crop producing countries. Importers and traders are obliged to assess their respective supply chains for the potential presence of authorised and unauthorised GM organisms (GMOs), where wrong decisions may lead to substantial economic losses. This article presents a decision support system SIGMO aimed at guiding producers and traders with the assessment of the likelihood that their products may comprise authorised or unauthorised GM materials. The assessment is based on traceability data about the product (nature and origin of the raw materials, transportation aspects), as well as analytical results of the presence of GMOs in the final product or its ingredients. The approach uses a combination of data-driven and model-driven decision support. SIGMO is composed of (1) a data base providing data about GMO crop species produced and approved in counties worldwide, (2) a multi-attribute model for the assessment of GMO presence in food/feed products, and (3) an on-line user interface. SIGMO helps producers and traders to better comply to valid EU GMO regulations and to better control their products and supply chains in terms of the unintended presence of (unauthorised) GMOs in a cost-effective way.

AB  - The imprecise quality of service (QoS) evaluations from consumers may lead to the inappropriate prediction for the trustworthiness of cloud services in an uncertain cloud environment. The service ranking prediction is a promising idea to overcome this deficiency of values prediction approaches by probing the ordering relations between cloud services concealed in the imprecise evaluations. To address the challenges for trustworthy service selection resulting from fluctuating QoS, flexible service pricing and complicated potential risks, this paper proposes a time-aware approach to predict the trustworthiness ranking of cloud services, with the tradeoffs between performance-cost and potential risks in multiple periods. In this approach, the interval neutrosophic set (INS) theory is utilized to describe and assess the performance-costs and potential risks of cloud services: (1) the original evaluation data about cloud services are preprocessed into the trustworthiness interval neutrosophic numbers (INNs); (2) the new INS operators are proposed with the theoretical proofs to calculate the possibility degree and the ranking values of trustworthiness INNs, contributing to the identification of the neighboring users based on the Kendall rank correlation coefficient (KRCC). The problem of time-aware trustworthiness ranking prediction is formulated as a multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) problem of creating a ranked services list using INS, and an improved ELECTRE method is developed to solve it. The proposed approach is verified by experiments based on an appropriate baseline for comparative analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve a better prediction quality than the existing approach. The results also show that our approach works effectively in the risk-sensitive and performance-cost-sensitive application scenarios and prevent the malignant price competition launched by low-quality services.

AB  - This paper introduces a new hub-and-center transportation network problem for a new company competing against an operating company. The new company intends to locate p hubs and assign the center nodes to the located hubs in order to form origin–destination pairs. It desires not only to maximize the total captured flow in the market but also aims to minimize the total transportation cost. Three competition rules are established between the companies which must be abided. According to the competition rules, the new company can capture the full percentage of the traffic in each origin-destination pair if its transportation cost for each route is significantly less than of the competitor. If its transportation cost for each route is not significantly less than one of the competitors, only a certain percentage of the traffic can be captured. A bi-objective optimization model is proposed for the hub location problem on hand under a competitive environment. As the problem is shown to be NP-hard, a novel meta-heuristic algorithm called multi-objective biogeography-based optimization is developed. As there is no benchmark in the literature, a popular non-dominated sorting algorithm is utilized to validate the results obtained. Moreover, to enhance the performance of the proposed Pareto-based algorithms, this paper intends to develop a binary opposition-based learning as a diversity mechanism for both algorithms. The algorithms are tuned to solve the problem, based on which their performances are compared, ranked, and analyzed statistically. Finally, the applicability of the proposed approach and the solution methodologies are demonstrated in three steps.

To properly select a material type for a specific product, various issues and requirements should be considered. These issues include the design of the product, the manufacturing process, safety, price, energy required for production, functionality, human ergonomic, toxicity, and the recyclability or life cycle assessment of the product at the end of its life. Therefore, composites as engineered functional materials have various issues to be considered during their selection process. This chapter deals with materials selection for composites materials. It provides information on various issues in materials selection for composites, as well as their constituents (matrices and fibers). Research works on materials selection for composites and advanced techniques in composite materials selection are also discussed.

AB  - The consideration of stakeholders' perceptions and preferences on different ecosystem services, identifying potential conflict areas, is essential for operationalizing integrated management plans. In the central coast of Chile, several traditional fishing resources are overexploited and conflicts between users might arise with the increasing demand of both traditional and new uses. The principal groups of users in coastal areas were characterized in order to generate information that advances towards integrative approaches in the region. Face-to-face surveys to fishermen, tourists and permanent residents were conducted in six coastal sites to identify what these groups value the most, assessing at the same time if differences in perceptions and use might suggest future conflicts between users associated to coastal planning. Participants had to prioritize a list of coastal attributes associated with ecosystem services. Results show variability in prioritization of coastal attributes amongst groups of users, however, variability across sites was low. Fishermen showed a tight economic and cultural dependency on provisioning services; however, their general perception was of decreasing catches and a shift to less valued resources and habitat structuring species as traditional ecosystem services deteriorate. Tourists and residents had the most homogenous perceptions, and agreed on the prioritization of intangible services, such as the quietness and scenery of the coast. Nevertheless, deterioration of the environment was perceived as relevant by the inhabitants of the study area, reflecting a potential conflict between the current increase in tourist influx and resource demand. Therefore, increasing recreational use needs to be managed, ensuring the resilience of the traditional fisheries and adopting effective actions that should encompass wider ecosystem objectives. However, the real challenge for integrated management is the incorporation of intangible values in conservation objectives.

AB  - Context: Software process improvement (SPI) aims to increase the effectiveness of a software organization. Many studies indicate that the strategic alignment is a critical factor for the SPI success. However, little is known about practical approaches to achieving and maintaining such alignment. Objective: The goal of this study is to evaluate the validation evidence of the existing approaches to the strategic alignment of SPI. Method: We develop a search protocol that combines database search and snowballing to perform the systematic literature review and evaluate empirical studies by applying rigor and relevance criteria. To evaluate the efficiency of our protocol, we use a “quasi-gold standard” to compute the sensitivity and precision of the search. Result: We identified 30 studies (18 empirical) and 19 approaches to strategic alignment of SPI from 495 retrieved studies. Only three out of the 18 empirical studies were rated as high in the categories rigor and relevance, suggesting the need for a stronger validation of the approaches. Conclusion: We conclude that the lack of empirical validation indicates that the results of the existing approaches have not been adequately transferred to practitioners yet, calling for more rigorous studies on the subject.

AB  - Improved soil and water management practices can reduce moisture stress and crop failures associated with rain-fed cropping systems. Little information exists on soil and water management technologies requirements for male and female farmers in different agro-ecological regions. The objective of current study was to investigate farmers’ sources of information and perceptions on soil and water management technologies. Four sites selected from different agro-ecological regions (AERs), sub-humid (Mazowe/Goromonzi, and Kadoma) and semi-arid (Matobo and Chiredzi). Data on sources of information on soil and water management, types of technologies preferred by farmers and constraints to adoption of technologies were collected through household interviews and focus group discussions. Results showed that government extension agents, farmer-to farmer extension and non-governmental organizations were the main sources of information on soil and water management technologies at all the sites. NGOs mainly provide information on reduced tillage methods. Main technologies were mulching (61%), reduced tillage methods (53%), and contour ridges (33%) in Mazowe/Goromonzi district, reduced tillage method (83) and mulching (64%) in Kadoma, and reduced tillage methods (54%) and contour ridges (47%) in Matobo. More farmers used soil and water management technologies at the sub-humid sites than at the semi-arid sites. Soil and water conservation technologies used were similar between male-headed (MHH) and female-headed households (FHH). Soil and water conservation technologies used by farmers matched their preferences in two of the four study sites. The findings are important for targeting soil and water management practices in the various agro-ecological zones.

AB  - Although precision farming has matured enough to provide off-the-shelf solutions, the level of penetration in southeast European agricultural production is low. The aim of this work was to identify the locations with highest potential for adopting precision farming in the Region of Central Macedonia (Greece) and promote the adoption of precision farming clusters, as a measure toward reducing input agriculture. This was achieved through spatial multicriteria decision analysis on several geographic layers and the identification of the appropriate weights for the criteria through the analytic hierarchy process. A Geographic Information System was incorporated to perform the analysis of numerous layers that describe the environmental, social, and economic relevant data of the study area. Five locations were selected because of their potentially high benefit on an environmental and socio-economic dimension if they were to replace the conventional farming techniques and adopt precision farming. Educational and information sessions were set up within the selected locations, and questionnaires were used to collect the farmers’ perceptions. The formation of precision farming clusters was promoted as a sustainable solution to the attendees, and questionnaires were used to collect their opinion. To form an integrated approach toward precision farming adoption, additional recommendations were provided to support pilot actions that will act as showcases of success stories.

KW  - Building Energy Demand

KW  - Energy Assessment Tool
KW  - Delphi Technique
AB  - In Ghana, the inability to solve peak demand constraints by finding a balance between reducing demand and increasing supply has resulted in power rationing coupled with erratic electricity supply. Various studies have reported the enormous influence energy assessment tools, contribute to solving building energy demand. However, no building energy standards are in place in Ghana and this is aggravated by lack of data for building energy consumption. As a first step towards developing a building energy efficiency assessment tool this paper aims to identify applicable energy efficient building assessment categories and criteria for the Ghanaian Built environment. As building assessment methods involve multi-dimensional criteria, a consensus based approach is used to conduct the research. Hence, the Delphi technique is selected and conducted in two successive consultation rounds involving professionals and highly informed local experts from academia, government and industry in the domain of building energy assessment methods. The results reveal that international assessment methods are not fully applicable to the Ghana built environment, as reflected in the identification of new energy efficient building assessment criteria. The research is focused in Ghana and similar developing countries grappling with building energy problems. It is expected that findings from the study will provide further directions towards the full development of building energy assessment tool in such regions.

AB  - Compared with Computer Aided Design (CAD) to use computer graphics technologies to describe geometric information for the product design, many new methodologies and systems have been developed in the past decades in product modeling to extend the functions of the traditional CAD systems. In the product representation aspect, in addition to the design solution usually modeled by geometric descriptions, modeling of product knowledge has been widely investigated to describe the rationale for creation of the product solution. In the information technology aspect, in addition to the traditional computing tools such as computer programming languages and object oriented design, distributed computing technologies particularly Internet, web and cloud computing tools have been widely employed to implement product modeling systems. In the product development process aspect, in addition to the design solution, other product lifecycle aspects such as manufacturing, maintenance and service have been modeled and integrated into the same environment. In this literature review, the recent advances of research on product modeling in product representation, information technologies and product development process are investigated from these three new perspectives: knowledge, distributed computing, and product lifecycle. In addition, traditional methodologies and future challenges in computer-based product modeling are also discussed.

AB  - This paper develops a data-driven model that quantifies the benefits of supply chain collaboration initiatives such as a continuous replenishment program (CRP). CRP is a well-established supply chain collaboration program that is widely used in business. The model computes the cost savings of CRP for both partners involving inventory holding, transportation and ordering/handling cost components. The savings drivers associated with each cost component are identified and used to quantify the impact of CRP. The model is applied in a healthcare supply chain case study where a manufacturer seeks to estimate the cost savings of a business relationship with a distributor. The results indicate that CRP reduces the total cost of the supply chain by 19.1%. In this instance, the distributor gains disproportionately more savings in the shared cost components. The variability and sensitivity of cost savings across the network reveal the supply chain parameters that affect the partner savings.

AB  - This paper aims to develop a new hesitant fuzzy mathematical programming method for hybrid multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM) with hesitant fuzzy truth degrees and incomplete criteria weight information. In this method, the types of assessment information on criteria are expressed by Atanassov intuitionistic fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets, trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, intervals and real numbers, respectively. Firstly, the distances of each alternative to positive ideal solution (PIS) and negative ideal solution (NIS) are calculated. Then the hesitant fuzzy positive ideal group consistency index (HFPGCI) and hesitant fuzzy positive ideal group inconsistency index (HFPGICI), the hesitant fuzzy negative ideal group consistency index (HFNGCI) and hesitant fuzzy negative ideal group inconsistency index (HFNGICI) are defined, respectively. To derive the PIS, NIS and the criteria weights simultaneously, a new four-objective hesitant fuzzy mathematical programming model is constructed by minimizing the HFPGICI and HFNGICI as well as maximizing the HFPGCI and HFNGCI. Using the geometric-mean score functions of hesitant fuzzy sets, the four-objective programming model is transformed to a single objective program to resolve. Subsequently, the relative closeness degrees of alternatives for each decision maker (DM) are obtained and applied to derive the individual ranking order of alternatives. To generate the collective ranking order of alternatives, a multi-objective assignment model is established and converted into a single objective programming model to resolve. Thus, a new hesitant fuzzy mathematical programming method is proposed to solve hybrid MCGDM. Finally, a real example is provided to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the proposed method.

AB  - In financial markets, investors attempt to maximize their profits within a constructed portfolio with the aim of optimizing the tradeoffs between risk and return across the many stocks. This requires proper handling of conflicting factors, which can benefit from the domain of multiple criteria decision making (MCDM). However, the indexes and factors representing the stock performance are often imprecise or vague and this should be represented by linguistic terms characterized by fuzzy numbers. The aim of this research is to first develop three group MCDM methods, then use them for selecting undervalued stocks by dint of financial ratios and subjective judgments of experts. This study proposes three versions of fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution): conventional TOPSIS (C-TOPSIS), adjusted TOPSIS (A-TOPSIS) and modified TOPSIS (M-TOPSIS) where a new fuzzy distance measure, derived from the confidence level of the experts and fuzzy performance ratings have been included in the proposed methods. The practical aspects of the proposed methods are demonstrated through a case study in the Tehran stock exchange (TSE), which is timely given the need for investors to select undervalued stocks in untapped markets in the anticipation of easing economic sanctions from a change in recent government leadership.

AB  - The objective of this study is to measure efficiency change of bank branches under external environment deterioration. In particular, we utilize a bootstrap input-oriented profit DEA and investigate homogeneous and heterogeneous branches according to branch size and location to measure efficiency change by contrasting expansion, recession and capital control effects that constitute a unique phenomenon in the postwar period in the Eurozone. Our primary research explicitly focuses on the whole retail network of a Greek systemic bank based on unpublished monthly branch Profit and Loss statements and covers the period from January 2006 to July 2016. We find that early and deep recession reduces on average branch network efficiency. The imposition of capital controls (end-month June 2015) initially causes marginal effects with a subsequent efficiency improvement in the first seven months of 2016 when economic conditions are normalized. The paper documents that branch size and location matter. On the whole, we capture efficiency deterioration in the long-run contrary to recent European evidence. Apart from the efficiency measurement over time, we provide directions to bank management for performance improvement in the capital control period. More specifically, a bootstrap DEA-based Decision Tree classification exactly quantifies for the first time a potential upgrading of underperforming branches and a second-stage bootstrap DEA regression locates important efficiency drivers such as the diversification of income and the deposit- oriented activity that could improve efficiency of the total retail network.

The viability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated via the sales representatives of Beko, a brand name controlled by Koç Group. We first develop a conceptual framework based on qualitative research methods – in-depth interviews and focus group sessions. We employ the principles of ANP methodology to examine and discover the inter-relationships among the OCBs. This process results in a descriptive model that encapsulates the findings from both qualitative and analytics methods. Necessity, altruism, departmental, compliance, and independence are the underlying dimensions of OCBs found to be the most influential/important. The key novelty of this study resides in designing and developing a prescriptive analytics (i.e. ANP) methodology to evaluate the OCBs, which is rare in the area of organizational behavior (a managerial field of study that have been dominated by traditional statistical methods), and thus serves as a useful contribution/augmentation to the business/managerial research methods, and also extends the reach/coverage of analytics-based decision support systems research and practice into a new direction.

The performance of four different microchannel heat sink (MCHS) configurations are investigated experimentally, the first having an array of straight rectangular microchannels (SRMs), while the other have single (SPSMs), double (DPSMs) and triple path multi-serpentine rectangular microchannels (TPSMs). Three-dimensional conjugate heat transfer models are developed for both laminar and turbulent single-phase water flows in each of these MCHSs and the governing flow and energy equations solved numerically using finite elements. The numerical predictions of pressure drop (ΔP) and average Nusselt number (Nuavg) are in good agreement with experimental data, and indicated that the single path serpentine microchannel (SPSM) leads to a 35% enhancement of the Nuavg at a volumetric flow rate of 0.5l/min and a 19% reduction in total thermal resistance (Rth) compared to the conventional SRM heat sink. However, this enhancement is at the expense of a large (up to ten-fold) increase in ΔP compared to the SRM heat sink, so that a suitable compromise must be struck between heat transfer and pressure drop in practical MCHS designs.

AB  - Concrete is one of the most widespread construction materials in the world, but its production is responsible for significant amounts of energy consumption, and even greater greenhouse gas emissions. However, the substitution of Portland cement with fly ash (FA) reduces both the energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions generated during the production of clinker. Currently, most studies of FA concrete focus on mechanical properties, sustainability assessments (environment, society and economy) of FA during its life cycle have not been reported. This paper presents a life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) that brings together environmental, economic and social impacts using a proposed three-dimensional coordinate diagram to combine the different units into a single sustainable value. The assessment method is applied to different substitutions of FA in concrete to ascertain the optimum substitution percentage across these three factors. Monte Carlo simulation is then used to evaluate the durability of concrete structures with different FA addition in order to calculate their service life. A case study is conducted of a bridge structure with different FA substitutions; this demonstrates that the addition of FA would improve the sustainability of concrete significantly in the short term. However, when the durability and service life of the structure are taken into account, without maintenance, the use of FA concrete may not improve the environment performance due a potentially shortened service life, but it can reduce the social burden and save costs significantly over the long term.

AB  - Background
Personalized medicine and orphan drugs share many characteristics—both target small patient populations, have uncertainties regarding efficacy and safety at payer submission, and frequently have high prices. Given personalized medicine's rising importance, this review summarizes international coverage and pricing strategies for personalized medicine and orphan drugs as well as their impact on therapy development incentives, payer budgets, and therapy access and utilization.
Methods
PubMed, Health Policy Reference Center, EconLit, Google Scholar, and references were searched through February 2017 for articles presenting primary data.
Results
Sixty-nine articles summarizing 42 countries’ strategies were included. Therapy evaluation criteria varied between countries, as did patient cost-share. Payers primarily valued clinical effectiveness; cost was only considered by some. These differences result in inequities in orphan drug access, particularly in smaller and lower-income countries. The uncertain reimbursement process hinders diagnostic testing. Payer surveys identified lack of comparative effectiveness evidence as a chief complaint, while manufacturers sought more clarity on payer evidence requirements. Despite lack of strong evidence, orphan drugs largely receive positive coverage decisions, while personalized medicine diagnostics do not.
Conclusions
As more personalized medicine and orphan drugs enter the market, registries can provide better quality evidence on their efficacy and safety. Payers need systematic assessment strategies that are communicated with more transparency. Further studies are necessary to compare the implications of different payer approaches.

AB  - A method has been developed for the separation of moxifloxacin HCl and ketorolac tromethamine using reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on C18 column (250×4.6mm, 5μm) with UV detection at 308nm. Experimental designs were applied for multivariate optimization of the experimental conditions of RP-HPLC method. Three independent factors: methanol content in the mobile phase composition, buffer pH and flow rate were used to design mathematical models. Here faced central composite (FCC) experimental design was used to study the response surface technique and to study in depth the effects of these independent factors. Derringer’s desirability function was applied to simultaneously optimize the retention time of last eluting peak (ketorolac tromethamine) and tailing factor of moxifloxacin. The predicted optimum assay condition consisted of methanol and potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 3.2; 25mM, 0.5% Triethylamine) in a proportion of 60:40%v/v, respectively, as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.2mLmin−1. Using this optimum condition, baseline separation of both drugs with good resolution and a run time of less than 7min were achieved. The optimized assay condition was validated according to ICH guidelines to confirm specificity, linearity, accuracy and precision.

KW  - Generalized dominance rough set
KW  - Generalized -dominance rough set
KW  - Attribute reduction
AB  - Dominance rough sets generalize classical rough sets by replacing the equivalence relation with a dominance relation. However, the existing dominance relations are still too restrictive to convenient for its practical applications because they are always considering a strict decreasing or increasing order for each attribute. In fact, in many real-world problems, we only need to employ the decreasing or increasing order in terms of partial attributes rather than all attributes or even just focus on overall evaluations of objects. Based on this phenomenon, in this paper we define two new dominance relations and obtain two generalized dominance rough set models according to define the overall evaluations and add particular requirements for some individual attributes. Meanwhile, the attribute reductions of dominance intuitionistic fuzzy decision information systems are also examined with these two models. Firstly, we define a generalized dominance relation and obtain a generalized dominance rough set model by using the intuitionistic fuzzy additive operator to aggregate individual attribute value of each object into a overall evaluation. The attribute reduction of intuitionistic fuzzy information systems with generalized dominance rough set are also explored. Secondly, we introduce another dominance relation named as generalized β-dominance relation and the generalized β-dominance rough set model by adding a parameter β ∈ [0, 1] in generalized dominance relation in order to control the number of attributes which satisfy dominance relations, from which we can induce all “at least” and “at most” decision rules. An algorithm is developed to compute the lower and upper β-dominance approximations in order to get all the lower and upper reducts of intuitionistic fuzzy decision systems. Some numerical examples are employed to substantiate the conceptual arguments.

AB  - The present study proposes a novel decision model to aggregate production planning (APP) decision making problem based on mixed chase and level strategy under uncertainty where the market demand acts as the main source of uncertainty. By taking into account the novel features, the constructed model turns out to be stochastic, nonlinear, multi-stage and multi-objective. APP in practice entails multiple-objectivity. Therefore, the model involves multiple objectives such as total revenue, total production costs, total labour productivity costs, optimum utilisation of production resources and capacity and customer satisfaction, and is validated on the basis of real world data from beverage manufacturing industry. Applying the recourse approach in stochastic programming leads to empty feasible space, and therefore the wait and see approach is used instead. After solving the model using the real-world industrial data, sensitivity analysis and several forms of trade-off analysis are conducted by changing different parameters/coefficients of the constructed model, and by analysing the compromise between objectives respectively. Finally, possible future research directions, with regard to the limitations of current study, are discussed.

AB  - In order to realize sustainable cities, it is vital to achieve and maintain social behavioral change for shifting our modes of mobility from inefficient, wasteful and motorized means to cleaner, greener, healthier and more economic means such as walking, cycling and public transportation in addition to smart use of land, intelligent transportation systems, and clean and green vehicles. This study is based on a critical review of literature in order to establish a framework of social behavioral change policies, particularly developed and tested for urban mobility and traffic congestion. First, various mega cities were compared on different sustainability indicators to better understand the case of Istanbul. Then, selected policy potentials, namely Travel Demand Management (TDM), were evaluated for Istanbul following a set of personal interview surveys aiming to reveal travel patterns of residents, their perceptions and attitudes on current transport system performance, and their opinions for possible TDM interventions in the future. We proposed a multiplicative model to process data from these surveys as inputs, which would then be used to determine travel demand. A simulation model was constructed using PTV-VISSIM tool and validated with current traffic congestion metrics obtained from field measurements in a selected district of Istanbul. Based on this validated simulation model, projections of traffic conditions in the future under different TDM scenarios were predicted with the help of determined TDM potentials obtained from the survey results. As a result of this study, it was revealed that the traffic congestion levels in Istanbul tend to become worse year by year under existing conditions, but it was also found that the TDM policies offer significant potential for reducing congestion, hence its consequent hazards, via increased use of sustainable mobility modes without the need for new infrastructure investments.

AB  - Equality between economic progress and environmental sustainability is essential for a developing country like India. In the present time, the economy of India is growing rapidly in a vibrant mode and an efficient way, which in turn demands huge uninterrupted energy supplies. The country's energy needs are met mostly by the usage of fossil fuels and nearly 70% of electricity is generated from coal based power plants. In India, nearly 840 million people depend on traditional biomass to satisfy their energy necessities. Approximately 74 million rural people do not have access to modern lighting systems and around 81 million households do not have access to electricity, which is a major challenge to India's energy security. In order to achieve stable sustainable energy in the long-run, significant progress in renewable energy sectors is needed. Favorably, due to India's geographic location, the country is blessed with abundant renewable energy resources, which has not yet been exploited completely. So the central and state governments of the country have framed various policies and are providing subsidies to encourage the utilization of solar photovoltaic systems. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the potential, current developmental status and prospects of solar energy of India is briefed. The various applications of solar energy such as water heaters, desalination units, pasteurizers, food drying units, water purifier, space heating systems, air-conditioning units, cookers, water pumps, aerators, solar-wind hybrid systems and grid connected photovoltaic systems are explained. The study also mentions the current renewable energy policies, the barriers blocking the progress of the solar manufacturing units and some possible future recommendations that might speed up renewable energy developments in India.

AB  - A vulnerability assessment frame is necessary from a holistic perspective that integrates the factors that affect a territory along with socio-cultural elements and timescales subsequent to the disasters. Such a frame has the potential to assess a territory's particular characteristics and generate local knowledge for prevention, mitigation, and response. Recent studies on the subject have focused on vulnerability analyses in a fragmented manner; therefore, it is appropriate to study the effects of natural disasters from a territorial perspective when considering risk. This study emphasizes identifying indicators for each factor in the territorial system and analyzes the datasets obtained for the case studies. In this article, stakeholder participation is highlighted as a transversal element that Voinov and Bousquet (2010) [58] have suggested contributes to an increased knowledge of the actors and system and the system's dynamics under various conditions, such as vulnerability. The analysis shows that the design of risk management public policies in Colombia should consider the different aspects of the territorial system. The results show that local knowledge can be used to estimate vulnerability and support plans that improve local resilience.

AB  - Although fossil fuels are the main sources of power generation, they are losing their advantages because of their limitations and environmental and economic concerns. As an alternative, the development of renewable energy technologies is one of the important strategies. Therefore, governments have been encouraging the deployment of renewable energy resources. However, there are gaps between achievements and targets. As most of the national renewable energy development policies are formulated in the entire country equally, the outputs and achievements are different depending on the geographical characteristics, social and economic capabilities of the regions. The purpose of the present study is the analysis and the evaluation of the effectiveness of the equal national renewable energy policy in the different regions of a country. This research focuses on the idea that whether the codification of energy policies according to the local circumstances of each region can result in a greater efficiency of such policies. An innovative framework is presented to categorize the government policies based on the geographical, technical and socio-economic indicators. To examine the presented framework, it is implemented as a case study.

AB  - Decisions made in the early design stages critically determine a building’s life cycle environmental impacts and costs. Dynamic building performance feedback has the potential to improve design decision-making, but the best means of providing such feedback is not well understood. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of three visualization tools in helping designers make sustainable building design decisions. A charrette was conducted in which participants were tasked with minimizing carbon emissions and cost of an office building based on feedback from a scatterplot, histogram, and tornado diagram. Results demonstrate that designers achieved significant improvements in solution quality when feedback was present, with the scatterplot achieving a 20% improvement over conventional methods. The research quantifies the effectiveness of various visualization methods in helping designers create low-carbon, high-performing buildings and suggests that quantity and type of feedback should be carefully considered during the early stages of the sustainable design process.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel multi-objective bee foraging algorithm (MOBFA) based on two-engine co-evolution mechanism for solving multi-objective optimization problems. The proposed MOBFA aims to handle the convergence and diversity separately via evolving two cooperative search engines with different evolution rules. Specifically, in the colony-level interaction, the primary concept is to first assign two different performance evaluation principles (i.e., Pareto-based measure and indicator-based measure) to the two engines for evolving each archive respectively, and then use the comprehensive learning mechanism over the two archives to boost the population diversity. In the individual-level foraging, the neighbor-discount-information (NDI) learning based on reinforcement learning (RL) is integrated into the single-objective searching to adjust the flight trajectories of foraging bee. By testing on a suit of benchmark functions, the proposed MOBFA is verified experimentally to be superior or at least comparable to its competitors in terms of two commonly used metrics IGD and SPREAD.

AB  - Recent interest in biomass supply chain management has stimulated research efforts in the industry and academic communities. Techno-economic modeling and optimization efforts targeted on the upstream segment of the forest biomass to bio-oil supply chain are reviewed. Key components of upstream supply chain decision making are then presented through an overview and classification of the existing methods and contributions. There is a need to classify and analyze the relevant methodologies and approaches identified in prior studies, and to subsequently assess their usefulness through empirical research and case-based analysis. Both narrative and systematic literature reviews are performed using qualitative analysis and classic bibliometric techniques to demonstrate the scope of current papers and the call for future needs. It is found, due to growing demands for bioenergy, future biomass-to-bioenergy supply chains should draw upon existing research toward the development of efficient and effective forest biomass supply chain networks. It is further concluded that a new generation of pretreatment technologies is needed for techno-economic optimization of upstream forest biomass value chains.

We developed and demonstrated a structural and empirical service design using an integration of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), service QFD (Quality Function Deployment), and service blueprint approaches. Problem-formulator was carried out to generate customer requirements in the problem definition phase. The combination of service QFD and TRIZ contradiction analysis were applied to derive service solutions. In the solution evaluation stage, cloud-based self-service ordering system was proposed and a blueprint of the new meal service is then presented. The proposed new service can enhance the flexibility of meal-production by immediately responding to ordering requests and enable a tight partnership between case company and staff canteen operators with minimal management effort. The contribution of this structural and empirical service design methodology can improve performance and competitiveness of service innovation. In general, the proposed cloud intelligent solutions, with an interactive menu and a cloud-based interoperable meal order system can be applied to other canteen meal services and even other businesses providing meal services.

AB  - Business process management (BPM) is an essential paradigm of organizational design and a source of corporate performance. The most value-creating activity of BPM is process improvement. With effective process prioritization being a critical success factor for process improvement, we propose the Data-Driven Process Prioritization (D2P2) approach. By addressing the weaknesses of extant process prioritization approaches, the D2P2 accounts for structural and stochastic process dependencies and leverages log data. The D2P2 returns a priority list that indicates in which future periods the processes from a process network should undergo the next in-depth analysis to check whether they actually require improvement. The D2P2 contributes to the prescriptive knowledge on process prioritization and process decision-making. As for evaluation, we discussed the D2P2's design specification against theory-backed design objectives and competing artefacts. We also instantiated the D2P2 as a software prototype and applied the prototype to a real-world scenario based on the 2012 BPI Challenge log.

With a view to achieving a better understanding of the research work on this subject, this paper conducts a bibliometric analysis and a review of existing literature on BIM focusing on the last decade. The authors selected the articles published in journals with an impact factor higher then 1.0, as well as the top 100 most cited articles. The search resulted on 381 articles, which were then categorised in order to systematise the research conducted over the years. The authors have not only analysed the existing literature but also highlighted new emerging fields in BIM research, being possible to identify Collaborative Environments and Interoperability, Sustainable Construction, BIM Adoption & Standardisation, and BIM Programming as the categories with the most significant growth in the last years. It was also observed that the most researched topics were related with the development of BIM tools, the study of BIM adoption worldwide, the energy simulation using BIM-based information and, more recently, with the semantic interoperability and ontology. On the other hand, the study on BIM at the academic level is very small, as well as parametric modelling and quantity take-off.

In this paper, we present a classification of the maintenance and service logistics literature considering the key characteristics of a particular sector as a guideline, i.e., the maritime sector. We discuss the applicability and the shortcomings of existing works and highlight the lessons learned from a maritime sector perspective. Finally, we identify the potential future research directions and suggest a research agenda. Most of the maritime sector characteristics presented in this paper are also valid for other capital-intensive industries. Therefore, a big part of this survey is relevant and functional for industries such as aircraft/aerospace, defense, and automotive.

AB  - The ability to anticipate global environmental changes will significantly reduce the biophysical, social and economic costs associated with eventual adaptation. An abstract modelling process often supports evidence-based decision making. Nonetheless, there are inherent difficulties for stakeholders in understanding complex scenario modelling. It is important to develop communication systems that support understanding of complex spatial decision models. This research used a Land Use Allocation (LUA) process, in the context of future agricultural land use under climate change scenarios, as a study in complex environmental modelling. The primary objective was to identify interactive options that can reduce the difficulty stakeholders have in understanding such an environmental model. A Spatial Model Steering (SMS) exploratory framework enabled users to explore the effects of climate change on land suitability, as a key aspect of LUA, and thus increase their perception of the influence of key factors. Within this framework, a user can visually steer the key climate, and climate response, related factors (rainfall, market price, and carbon price) of the LUA model, explore and compare “what if” future land use opportunities by adjusting these factors and visualize the spatial distribution of land suitability outcomes. The research compared the SMS approach with traditional methods of model output presentation and established that, with this approach, users develop both increased understanding of the key factors governing the underlying models and greater awareness of the uncertainty in the outcomes. This result provides a basis for the future use of complex spatial decision models within public debate.

AB  - Uncertainties associated with modeling and performance prediction of structures may be addressed and subsequently reduced by including, within the performance assessment, information collected from inspections and structural health monitoring (SHM). Under ideal conditions, continuous monitoring is required to accurately assess and predict the performance of deteriorating systems; however, in general, this is neither practical nor financially efficient. Presented herein is an approach that determines cost-effective SHM plans that consider the probability that the performance prediction model based on monitoring data is suitable throughout the life-cycle of ship structures. This probability is used to compute the expected average availability of monitoring data for prediction during the life-cycle of a system. Utility theory is employed to incorporate the influence of the decision maker's risk attitude on the relative desirability of SHM plans. Optimization techniques are utilized to simultaneously maximize the utilities associated with monitoring cost and expected average availability in order to determine optimal monitoring strategies under uncertainty. The effects of the formulation of the utility function, risk attitude of the decision maker, and number of uniform and non-uniform time monitoring intervals on optimal SHM plans are investigated. The capabilities of the proposed decision support framework are illustrated on a naval ship.

AB  - To survive in a fiercely competitive business environment, it has become increasingly important for physical retailers to provide customers with services offering a better shopping experience. Many renovate and enlarge their shopping spaces to make their stores more enjoyable places to visit. The growth in social media and the use of mobile devices provide retailers with an opportunity to offer a context-aware guidance service to enhance customers' in-store shopping experience. In this research, by extracting and analysing shopping information (shopping context, visiting trajectory) and social information (user's interest, friends' influence), a contextual store shopping recommendation system is proposed to provide an appropriate route for first-time customers or those who are unfamiliar with a retailer's shopping space. Our experimental results show that the proposed model is effective in providing an appropriate shopping route and enhancing users' shopping experience, which could significantly improve the profitability and competitive advantage of the retailers.

AB  - A weak acid extraction was used to mobilize the loosely bound metals in estuary sediment samples. More than 30% of Ag, As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Hg, Mn Ni, Pb and Zn were leached from the sediment showing that these metals are significantly present in the bioavailable form. PCA/APCS identified three sources of the metals, namely: lithogenic accounting for 72%, shipping related contributing 15% and traffic related representing 13% of the total load. Application of pollution index (PI) and modified pollution index (MPI) revealed that the sediment range from unpolluted to heavily polluted while ecological risk index (RI) classifies the sediment as posing low ecological risk modified ecological risk index (MRI) suggests considerable to very high ecological risk. To provide holistic insights into the ecological risks posed by metals, enrichment factor, MPI and MRI are recommended for the assessment of sediment in complex environments such as estuaries.

AB  - The main objective of study is to estimate and extract various significant Demand Pull (DP) practices influencing Sustainable Development in Indian manufacturing industries. The study critically examines the effectiveness of DP strategies in manufacturing enterprises. An extensive survey of 92 companies has been executed for this study, to identify improvements made by DP practices to achieve sustainable development in manufacturing industries. The companies in the survey include medium- and large-scale manufacturing enterprises. The correlations between various DP practices and sustainable development parameters are evaluated and validated using various numerical methods and tools. The focus of the paper is on the distinguishable contributions made by DP practices like stringent implementation of government regulations, transforming capabilities, unionized labor and customer attributes towards achieving sustainable development in manufacturing industries. The inter-relationships between different DP practices with sustainable development parameters have been evaluated, to efficiently manage the objectives of sustainability and growth. However, it is also acknowledged that manufacturing enterprises need to work more actively on managing certain practices of DP. In the present study the contributions of DP practices are investigated to accomplish sustainable development in manufacturing industries. Though, issue-wise independent examination can also be organized to compute the effectiveness of DP strategies towards achieving sustainable development and quality under specific orientations. The research gives priority to enhancement in planning among various DP practices and sustainable development indicators in the industries, to impart DP as an important practice to meet the challenges of competent markets worldwide. It has been exhibited from the observations that adequate DP strategies can efficiently contribute towards recognition of sustainable development to compete in the highly progressive global market. The results of various inter-relationships among DP practices and sustainable development parameters represent the effectiveness of DP practices for accomplishment of social as well as organizational objectives. The paper examines that DP practices are significant initiatives employed by the manufacturing organizations for performance improvement and sustainable development. The paper peeks into the study to find out DP issues that need to be assessed efficiently by companies to avail the benefits of sustainable development to meet the challenges posed by international markets.

AB  - Collaborative logistics networks (CLNs) are considered to be an effective organizational form for business cooperation that provides high stability and low cost. One common key issue regarding CLN resource combination is the network design optimization problem under discrete uncertainty (DU-CLNDOP). Operational environment changes and information uncertainty in network designs, due to partner selection, resource constrains and network robustness, must be effectively controlled from the system perspective. Therefore, a general two-stage quantitative framework that enables decision makers to select the optimal network design scheme for CLNs under uncertainty is proposed in this paper. Phase 1 calculates the simulation result of each hypothetical scenario of CLN resource combination using the expected value model with robust constraints. Phase 2 selects the optimal network design scheme for DU-CLNDOP using the orthogonal experiment design method. The validity of the model and method are verified via an illustrative example.

AB  - Dilemmas are pervasive in decision making. Although they offer the potential of reflecting on issues at stake from different perspectives, dilemmas often lead to paralysis for those encountering them. This study presents a three dimensional collaboration tool specifically developed to surface dilemmas in a multi-actor context. The assumption is that revealing and debating dilemmas encourage finding solutions that bridge the apparently competing demands that resulted in dilemmas in the first place. Our tool, called the ‘dilemma cube’, is based on cognitive mapping principles and allows a diversity of participants to share their interpreted actions, effects, and connections among different issues at stake. We tested our tool in a collaborative workshop for a multifunctional land use project in the Netherlands. Our results show that the ‘dilemma cube’ guided participants to share their interpretations about the project, revealing the interdependence of issues at stake. Revealing the socially-constructed nature of dilemmas in multi-actor contexts is the stepping stone to explore strategies that stimulate deliberation, and realize the opportunities of exploiting opposites in light of dilemmas.

AB  - The variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system has extremely different energy performance at various operation conditions. Its power consumption is inconsistent even under the steady operation condition. In order to accurately evaluate the VRF system’s dynamic energy performance, this study proposed a data-mining-based method to benchmark and assess its energy uses. The correlation analysis is used for key factors selection and the interquartile range rule is employed to remove outliers of the database. In addition, the power consumption patterns are classified using decision tree (DT) method. The classification results are validated by the ANOVA analysis and post hoc test. Nine energy benchmarks are established based on the classified power consumption patterns. Moreover, an energy consumption rating system is established to provide quantitative assessment on the power consumption of the VRF system. A case study is conducted by comparatively analyzing the energy performance of the VRF system at multiple refrigerant charge fault cases. Results show that both the PLR and OT significantly affected the power consumption of the VRF system. However, the degree to which the refrigerant charge fault affects system power consumption varies with the power consumption patterns. For different patterns, the power consumptions of the VRF system were either lower, higher or similar to each other at various RCLs. Results also suggest that the energy benchmarking process provide reasonable classification criteria, and the grading process provide quantitative assessment on the energy consumption. Therefore, the proposed dynamic energy benchmarks are reliable and reasonable to evaluate the dynamic energy performance of VRF systems.

AB  - The improvement of emergency department processes involves the need to take into consideration multiple variables and objectives in a highly dynamic and unpredictable environment, which makes the decision-making task extremely challenging. The use of different methodologies and tools to support the decision-making process is therefore a key issue. This article presents a novel approach in healthcare in which Discrete Event Simulation, Simulation-Based Multi-Objective Optimization and Data Mining techniques are used in combination. This methodology has been applied for a system improvement analysis in a Swedish emergency department. As a result of the project, the decision makers were provided with a range of nearly optimal solutions and design rules which reduce considerably the length of stay and waiting times for emergency department patients. These solutions include the optimal number of resources and the required level of improvement in key processes. The article presents and discusses the benefits achieved by applying this methodology, which has proven to be remarkably valuable for decision-making support, with regard to complex healthcare system design and improvement.

AB  - Condition-based maintenance strategies adapt maintenance planning through the integration of online condition monitoring of assets. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these strategies can be improved by integrating prognostics predictions and grouping maintenance actions respectively. In complex industrial systems, however, effective condition-based maintenance is intricate. Such systems are comprised of repairable assets which can fail in different ways, with various effects, and typically governed by dynamics which include time-dependent and conditional events. In this context, system reliability prediction is complex and effective maintenance planning is virtually impossible prior to system deployment and hard even in the case of condition-based maintenance. Addressing these issues, this paper presents an online system maintenance method that takes into account the system dynamics. The method employs an online predictive diagnosis algorithm to distinguish between critical and non-critical assets. A prognostics-updated method for predicting the system health is then employed to yield well-informed, more accurate, condition-based suggestions for the maintenance of critical assets and for the group-based reactive repair of non-critical assets. The cost-effectiveness of the approach is discussed in a case study from the power industry.

AB  - SaaS is revolutionizing the way of software delivery. Numerous tangible and intangible benefits of SaaS adoption enable organizations to reduce costs, increase efficiency, leverage latest technology without additional investment, enhance concentration on core business processes and enhance innovation. This inspires more users especially the Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs) to adopt SaaS for their business operations. Service providers have come up with wide array of SaaS products to meet the customer demands. However, a plethora of factors involved in pre-SaaS evaluation process and availability of several products for a single business operation makes it difficult for customers to choose the best reliable product for their business requirements. A tool to perform customer perspective based reliability evaluation of single product or comparative reliability based ranking of multiple products is currently not available. This issue has been addressed in the present research work and a Customer Oriented Reliability Evaluation (CORE) framework is proposed. AHP, one of the MCDM methods is used in the framework which accepts the comparative attribute preferences and assigns their weights, based on which the reliability values are calculated. The CORE framework facilitates customers to perform efficient SaaS product decision making process based on business requirement and their attribute preferences. The framework also helps providers to understand their product position and the expectations of the customers.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed a growing concern for safety and highlighted the importance of leadership in safety practice within high-risk organizations. By following up and integrating the state-of-art research trends, this study aims at (1) bridging a gap in safety leadership research – i.e., the lack of a holistic understanding of safety leadership contribution at all managerial levels within high-risk organizations; (2) developing and validating a weighted safety leadership model in the context of shipping which incorporates key safety leadership behaviors that may enable researchers and practitioners to better understand and exercise safety leadership in shipping organizations. To systematically fulfill the research aims, this study integrates both numerical and descriptive data by sequentially applying three interdependent research techniques – namely inductive analysis of literature, modified Delphi method and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The study results in a holistic weighted model with concrete safety leadership behaviors at each managerial level, which contributes to the building of theoretical foundations in the domain of safety leadership research and serves as practical standards for accelerating safety leadership development in shipping organizations.
