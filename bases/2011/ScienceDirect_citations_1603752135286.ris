AB  - This article develops an artificial neural network (ANN) based forecasting model using the past profit records of hotel commodities. Based on forecasting, hotel commodities are categorised into two kinds: ones that push up the revenue, and others, which pull it down. Thereafter, long and short term goals are formulated for fixing quota and proper revenue management under uncertainty. For long term goal, analytical network process (ANP) framework is adopted to establish interrelationships among the factors using DEMATEL methodology. Risk adjusted maximum expected profit is employed for short term goal. Subsequently optimal numbers of commodities are obtained using a fuzzy goal programming approach, and favourable price of the individual commodities is determined keeping the price elasticity as one. Finally, a comparison is made between the respective revenue generated with the new quota and price from the proposed revenue maximization model, and that of the old practised price and quota. The paper demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach. A case study of a hotel has been taken up to demonstrate the model.

AB  - Combining GIS with neuro-fuzzy modeling has the advantage that expert scientific knowledge in coastal aquaculture activities can be incorporated into a geospatial model to classify areas particularly vulnerable to pollutants. Data on the physical environment and its suitability for aquaculture in an Irish fjard, which is host to a number of different aquaculture activities, were derived from a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and GIS models. Subsequent incorporation into environmental vulnerability models, based on neuro-fuzzy techniques, highlighted localities particularly vulnerable to aquaculture development. The models produced an overall classification accuracy of 85.71%, with a Kappa coefficient of agreement of 81%, and were sensitive to different input parameters. A statistical comparison between vulnerability scores and nitrogen concentrations in sediment associated with salmon cages showed good correlation. Neuro-fuzzy techniques within GIS modeling classify vulnerability of coastal regions appropriately and have a role in policy decisions for aquaculture site selection.

AB  - Summary
In recent years droughts have been occurring frequently, and their impacts are being aggravated by the rise in water demand and the variability in hydro-meteorological variables due to climate change. As a result, drought hydrology has been receiving much attention. A variety of concepts have been applied to modeling droughts, ranging from simplistic approaches to more complex models. It is important to understand different modeling approaches as well as their advantages and limitations. This paper, supplementing the previous paper (Mishra and Singh, 2010) where different concepts of droughts were highlighted, reviews different methodologies used for drought modeling, which include drought forecasting, probability based modeling, spatio-temporal analysis, use of Global Climate Models (GCMs) for drought scenarios, land data assimilation systems for drought modeling, and drought planning. It is found that there have been significant improvements in modeling droughts over the past three decades. Hybrid models, incorporating large scale climate indices, seem to be promising for long lead-time drought forecasting. Further research is needed to understand the spatio-temporal complexity of droughts under climate change due to changes in spatio-temporal variability of precipitation. Applications of copula based models for multivariate drought characterization seem to be promising for better drought characterization. Research on decision support systems should be advanced for issuing warnings, assessing risk, and taking precautionary measures, and the effective ways for the flow of information from decision makers to users need to be developed. Finally, some remarks are made regarding the future outlook for drought research.

AB  - Detecting fraudulent financial statements (FFS) is critical in order to protect the global financial market. In recent years, FFS have begun to appear and continue to grow rapidly, which has shocked the confidence of investors and threatened the economics of entire countries. While auditors are the last line of defense to detect FFS, many auditors lack the experience and expertise to deal with the related risks. This study introduces a support vector machine-based fraud warning (SVMFW) model to reduce these risks. The model integrates sequential forward selection (SFS), support vector machine (SVM), and a classification and regression tree (CART). SFS is employed to overcome information overload problems, and the SVM technique is then used to assess the likelihood of FFS. To select the parameters of SVM models, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied. Finally, CART is employed to enable auditors to increase substantive testing during their audit procedures by adopting reliable, easy-to-grasp decision rules. The experiment results show that the SVMFW model can reduce unnecessary information, satisfactorily detect FFS, and provide directions for properly allocating audit resources in limited audits. The model is a promising alternative for detecting FFS caused by top management, and it can assist in both taxation and the banking system.

AB  - This paper presents a generic model for using different decision strategies in multi-criteria, personalized route planning. Some researchers have considered user preferences in navigation systems. However, these prior studies typically employed a high tradeoff decision strategy, which used a weighted linear aggregation rule, and neglected other decision strategies. The proposed model integrates a pairwise comparison method and quantifier-guided ordered weighted averaging (OWA) aggregation operators to form a personalized route planning method that incorporates different decision strategies. The model can be used to calculate the impedance of each link regarding user preferences in terms of the route criteria, criteria importance and the selected decision strategy. Regarding the decision strategy, the calculated impedance lies between aggregations that use a logical “and” (which requires all the criteria to be satisfied) and a logical “or” (which requires at least one criterion to be satisfied). The calculated impedance also includes taking the average of the criteria scores. The model results in multiple alternative routes, which apply different decision strategies and provide users with the flexibility to select one of them en-route based on the real world situation. The model also defines the robust personalized route under different decision strategies. The influence of different decision strategies on the results are investigated in an illustrative example. This model is implemented in a web-based geographical information system (GIS) for Isfahan in Iran and verified in a tourist routing scenario. The results demonstrated, in real world situations, the validity of the route planning carried out in the model.

AB  - In supply chain management, to build strategic and strong relationships, firms should select best suppliers by applying appropriate method and selection criteria. In this paper, to handle ambiguity and fuzziness in supplier selection problem effectively, a new weighted additive fuzzy programming approach is developed. Firstly, linguistic values expressed as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to assess the weights of the factors. By applying the distances of each factor between Fuzzy Positive Ideal Rating and Fuzzy Negative Ideal Rating, weights are obtained. Then applying suppliers’ constraints, goals and weights of the factors, a fuzzy multi-objective linear model is developed to overcome the selection problem and assign optimum order quantities to each supplier. The proposed model is explained by a numerical example.

AB  - Out of several generalizations of fuzzy set theory for various objectives, the notions introduced by Atanassov, 1983, Atanassov and Gargov, 1989 in defining intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets are interesting and very useful in modeling real life problems. Ranking of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets plays a vital role in decision-making, data analysis, artificial intelligence and socioeconomic system and it was studied in Xu, 2007c, Xu and Chen, 2007a, Ye, 2009. In this paper a new method for ranking interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets has been introduced and studied. The method is illustrated by numerical examples and compared with other methods. And then a new method for handling multi-criteria fuzzy decision-making problems based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets is presented in which criterion values for alternatives are interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The method proposed here can provide a useful way to efficiently help the decision-maker to make his decision. An illustrative example is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

AB  - Over the last few decades, many researchers have produced landslide susceptibility maps using different techniques including the probability method (frequency ratio), the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), bivariate, multivariate, logistics regression, fuzzy logic and artificial neural network In addition, a number of parameters such as lithology, slope, aspect, land cover, elevation, distance to stream, drainage density, distance to lineament, seismicity, and distance to road are recommended to analyze the mechanism of landslides. The data quality is a very important issue in landslide studies, and more accurate results will be achieved if the data is adequate, appropriate and drawn from a wide range of parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of the occurrence of landslides in Trabzon province, situated in north east Turkey. This was achieved using the following five methods the frequency ratio model, AHP, the statistical index (Wi), weighting factor (Wf) methods, and the logistics regression model, incorporating a Geographical Information System (GIS) and remote sensing techniques. In Trabzon province there has been an increasing occurrence of landslides triggered by rainfall. These landslides have resulted in death, significant injury, damage to property and local infrastructure and threat of further landslides continues. In order to reduce the effects of this phenomenon, it is necessary to scientifically assess the area susceptible to landslide. To achieve this, landslide susceptible areas were mapped the landslide occurrence parameters were analyzed using five different methods. The results of the five analyses were confirmed using the landslide activity map containing 50 active landslide zones. Then the methods giving more accurate results were determined. The validation process showed that the Wf method is better in prediction than the frequency ratio model, AHP, the statistical index (Wi), and logistics regression model.

AB  - An effective incident information management system needs to deal with several challenges. It must support heterogeneous distributed incident data, allow decision makers (DMs) to detect anomalies and extract useful knowledge, assist DMs in evaluating the risks and selecting an appropriate alternative during an incident, and provide differentiated services to satisfy the requirements of different incident management phases. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an incident information management framework that consists of three major components. The first component is a high-level data integration module in which heterogeneous data sources are integrated and presented in a uniform format. The second component is a data mining module that uses data mining methods to identify useful patterns and presents a process to provide differentiated services for pre-incident and post-incident information management. The third component is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) module that utilizes MCDM methods to assess the current situation, find the satisfactory solutions, and take appropriate responses in a timely manner. To validate the proposed framework, this paper conducts a case study on agrometeorological disasters that occurred in China between 1997 and 2001. The case study demonstrates that the combination of data mining and MCDM methods can provide objective and comprehensive assessments of incident risks.

In this study, we first review the progression in the use of fuzzy tools in tackling different manufacturing issues during the past two decades. We then apply fuzzy linear programming to a less emphasized, but important issue in manufacturing, namely that of product mix prioritization. The proposed algorithm, based on linear programming with fuzzy constraints and integer variables, provides several advantages to existing algorithm as it carries increased ease in understanding, in use, and provides flexibility in its application.

AB  - Wildland fire management is subject to manifold sources of uncertainty. Beyond the unpredictability of wildfire behavior, uncertainty stems from inaccurate/missing data, limited resource value measures to guide prioritization across fires and resources at risk, and an incomplete scientific understanding of ecological response to fire, of fire behavior response to treatments, and of spatiotemporal dynamics involving disturbance regimes and climate change. This work attempts to systematically align sources of uncertainty with the most appropriate decision support methodologies, in order to facilitate cost-effective, risk-based wildfire planning efforts. We review the state of wildfire risk assessment and management, with a specific focus on uncertainties challenging implementation of integrated risk assessments that consider a suite of human and ecological values. Recent advances in wildfire simulation and geospatial mapping of highly valued resources have enabled robust risk-based analyses to inform planning across a variety of scales, although improvements are needed in fire behavior and ignition occurrence models. A key remaining challenge is a better characterization of non-market resources at risk, both in terms of their response to fire and how society values those resources. Our findings echo earlier literature identifying wildfire effects analysis and value uncertainty as the primary challenges to integrated wildfire risk assessment and wildfire management. We stress the importance of identifying and characterizing uncertainties in order to better quantify and manage them. Leveraging the most appropriate decision support tools can facilitate wildfire risk assessment and ideally improve decision-making.

AB  - The multi-criteria decision making methods, Preference Ranking Organization METHods for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) and Graphical Analysis for Interactive Assistance (GAIA), and the two-way Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model were applied to airborne fine particle compositional data collected at three sites in Hong Kong during two monitoring campaigns held from November 2000 to October 2001 and November 2004 to October 2005. PROMETHEE/GAIA indicated that the three sites were worse during the later monitoring campaign, and that the order of the air quality at the sites during each campaign was: rural site>urban site>roadside site. The PMF analysis on the other hand, identified 6 common sources at all of the sites (diesel vehicle, fresh sea salt, secondary sulphate, soil, aged sea salt and oil combustion) which accounted for approximately 68.8±8.7% of the fine particle mass at the sites. In addition, road dust, gasoline vehicle, biomass burning, secondary nitrate, and metal processing were identified at some of the sites. Secondary sulphate was found to be the highest contributor to the fine particle mass at the rural and urban sites with vehicle emission as a high contributor to the roadside site. The PMF results are broadly similar to those obtained in a previous analysis by PCA/APCS. However, the PMF analysis resolved more factors at each site than the PCA/APCS. In addition, the study demonstrated that combined results from multi-criteria decision making analysis and receptor modelling can provide more detailed information that can be used to formulate the scientific basis for mitigating air pollution in the region.

AB  - Coupled optimization methods based on multi-objective genetic algorithms and approximation models are widely used in engineering optimizations. In the present paper, a similar framework is proposed for the aerodynamic optimization of turbomachinery by coupling the well known multi-objective genetic algorithm—NSGA-II and back propagation neural network. The verification results of mathematical problems show that the coupled method with the origin NSGA-II cannot get the real Pareto front due to the prediction error of BPNN. A modified crowding distance is proposed in cooperation with a coarse-to-fine approaching strategy based on the iterations between NSGA-II and BPNN. The results of mathematical model problems show the effect of these improving strategies. An industrial application case is implemented on a transonic axial compressor. The optimization objectives are to maximize efficiencies of two working points and to minimize the variation of the choked mass flow. CFD simulation is employed to provide the performance evaluation of initial training samples for BPNN. The optimized results are compared with optimization results of a single objective optimization based on weighting function. The comparison shows that the present framework can provide not only better solutions than the single objective optimization, but also various alternative solutions. The increase of computational costs is acceptable especially when approximation models are used.

The procedure is interactive in the sense that the decision maker directs the search for preferred alternatives by providing weights of the different attributes as well as parameters related to risk attitude and weighted dominance. The outranking relation builds on pairwise comparisons between optimistic and pessimistic weighted values as well as weighted dominance relations supported by volume based measures. The suggested procedure is referred to as the Weighted Overlap Dominance procedure (WOD).

AB  - Supplier selection attained the state of paramount importance for companies in the current scenario because of increasing global competition. Improper selection of suppliers will have an adverse impact on the overall performance of the company. The number of available alternatives in the current market is on a rise, and hence it becomes difficult to select a supplier from among a large lot. An attempt has been made to develop a new composite model using structural equation modeling and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process technique, based on the results of a survey of 151 respondents. Based on the criteria that influence the selection of suppliers, the model has been developed. The study also examines the supplier selection criteria and measures the supplier selection score using the developed model.

A comprehensive content-based course criterion model extracted from existing literature and expert opinions was developed. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to identify the relative importance of course criteria for the purpose of tailoring an optimal one-week immersion English as a second language (ESL) curriculum for elementary school students in a suburban county of Taiwan. The hierarchy model and AHP analysis utilized in the present study will be useful for resolving several important multi-criteria decision-making issues in planning and evaluating ESL programs. This study also offers valuable insights and provides a basis for further research in customizing ESL curriculum models for different student populations with distinct learning needs, goals, and socioeconomic backgrounds.

AB  - The accelerating interaction between technology and tourism has changed radically the efficiency and effectiveness of tourism organizations, as well as how consumers interact with organizations. In this study, a Web based intelligent framework for travel agencies is proposed that offers customers a fast and reliable response service in a less costly manner. The proposed framework integrates case-based reasoning (CBR) system with a well-known multi criteria decision making (MCDM) technique, namely Analytic Hierarchy Process, to enhance the accuracy and speed in case matching in tourism destination planning. The integration of two techniques enables taking advantages of their strengths and complements each other’s weaknesses. A case study is performed to demonstrate how this framework can facilitate intelligent decision support by retrieving best-fitted responses for customers.

The progress made in developing new models and methods that can be applied to this task is assessed in the context of the previous literature. Particular attention is given to those methods that are especially relevant for use in agile supply chains. The paper uses a classification framework that enables models intended for similar purposes to be compared and tracked over time. It is also used to identify a number of gaps in the literature. The findings highlight an on-going need to develop methods that are able to meet the combination of qualitative and quantitative objectives that are typically found in partner selection problems in practice.

AB  - Rough set theory is an effective supervised learning model for labeled data. However, it is often the case that practical problems involve both labeled and unlabeled data, which is outside the realm of traditional rough set theory. In this paper, the problem of attribute reduction for partially labeled data is first studied. With a new definition of discernibility matrix, a Markov blanket based heuristic algorithm is put forward to compute the optimal reduct of partially labeled data. A novel rough co-training model is then proposed, which could capitalize on the unlabeled data to improve the performance of rough classifier learned only from few labeled data. The model employs two diverse reducts of partially labeled data to train its base classifiers on the labeled data, and then makes the base classifiers learn from each other on the unlabeled data iteratively. The classifiers constructed in different reduct subspaces could benefit from their diversity on the unlabeled data and significantly improve the performance of the rough co-training model. Finally, the rough co-training model is theoretically analyzed, and the upper bound on its performance improvement is given. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms other representative models in terms of accuracy and even compares favorably with rough classifier trained on all training data labeled.

AB  - A fraudulent financial statement involves the intentional furnishing and/or publishing of false information in it and this has become a severe economic and social problem. We consider Data Mining (DM) based financial fraud detection techniques (such as regression, decision tree, neural networks and Bayesian networks) that help identify fraud. The effectiveness of these DM methods (and their limitations) is examined, especially when new schemes of financial statement fraud adapt to the detection techniques. We then explore a self-adaptive framework (based on a response surface model) with domain knowledge to detect financial statement fraud. We conclude by suggesting that, in an era with evolutionary financial frauds, computer assisted automated fraud detection mechanisms will be more effective and efficient with specialized domain knowledge.

AB  - In this paper, we propose the THESEUS method, a new approach based on fuzzy outranking relations to multi-criteria sorting problems. Compared with other outranking-based methods, THESEUS is inspired by another view of multi-criteria classification problems. It utilizes a new way of evaluating the assignment of an object to an element of the set of ordered categories that were previously defined. This way is based on comparing every possible assignment with the information from various preference relations that are derived from a fuzzy outranking relation defined on the universe of objects. The appropriate assignment is determined by solving a simple selection problem. The capacity of a reference set for making appropriate assignments is related to a good characterization of the categories. A single reference action characterizing a category may be insufficient to achieve well-determined assignments. In this paper, the reference set capacity to perform appropriate assignments is characterized by some new concepts. This capacity may be increased when more objects are added to the reference set. THESEUS is a method for handling the preference information contained in such larger reference sets.

AB  - As part of human resource management policies and practices, construction firms need to define competency requirements for project staff, and recruit the necessary team for completion of project assignments. Traditionally, potential candidates are interviewed and the most qualified are selected. Precise computing models, which could take various candidate competencies into consideration and then pinpoint the most qualified person with a high degree of accuracy, would be beneficial. This paper presents a fuzzy adaptive decision making model for selection of different types of competent personnel. For this purpose, human resources are classified into four types of main personnel: Project Manager, Engineer, Technician, and Laborer. Then the competency criteria model of each main personnel is developed. Decision making is performed in two stages: a fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for evaluating the competency criteria, and an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for establishing competency IF-THEN rules of the fuzzy inference system. Finally, a hybrid learning algorithm is used to train the system. The proposed model integrates a fuzzy logic qualitative approach and neural network adaptive capabilities to evaluate and rank construction personnel based on their competency. Results from this system in personnel staffing show the high capability of the model in making a high quality personnel selection.

Metaheuristics are emphasized because they are especially suitable when approximate solutions are good enough in the case that the global optimum is either unknown or computationally too expensive to obtain it; both are characteristics of a typical large scale project. Based on the review, we offer our view of this research area and their potential for practical use. An attempt is also made to identify project management related topics where further advancement needs to be made.

AB  - Objective
Biofeedback is today a recognized treatment method for a number of physical and psychological problems. Experienced clinicians often achieve good results in these areas and their success largely builds on many years of experience and often thousands of treated patients. Unfortunately many of the areas where biofeedback is used are very complex, e.g. diagnosis and treatment of stress. Less experienced clinicians may even have difficulties to initially classify the patient correctly. Often there are only a few experts available to assist less experienced clinicians. To reduce this problem we propose a computer-assisted biofeedback system helping in classification, parameter setting and biofeedback training.
Methods
The decision support system (DSS) analysis finger temperature in time series signal where the derivative of temperature in time is calculated to extract the features. The case-based reasoning (CBR) is used in three modules to classify a patient, estimate parameters and biofeedback. In each and every module the CBR approach retrieves most similar cases by comparing a new finger temperature measurement with previously solved measurements. Three different methods are used to calculate similarity between features, they are: modified distance function, similarity matrix and fuzzy similarity.
Results and conclusion
We explore how such a DSS can be designed and validated the approach in the area of stress where the system assists in the classification, parameter setting and finally in the training. In this case study we show that the case based biofeedback system outperforms trainee clinicians based on a case library of cases authorized by an expert.

To this end, this study reviews published port literature for the last three decades (1980–2000s). The investigation primarily categorises the literature according to various methodological issues such as research paradigm, research strategy, base-disciplines, research methods and analysis techniques in order to provide meaningful implications on methodological evolution in seaport research for the period. This study suggests methodological bias in port research to a positivistic paradigm, following a quantitative trajectory moving from conceptual to empirical studies. In addition, the increased use of mathematical modelling and advanced statistical analysis methods is clearly observed. The introduction of advanced analytical tools used in other academic disciplines facilitates discussions in particular research area and amplifies the literature in those areas. This paper also suggests research gaps from the methodological perspective and implications for future port research.

AB  - Massive multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) should be continuously and incrementally modified to meet with the customers’ increasing demand. However, that is a tough task since the number of customers is huge and all of the customers are geographically dispersed. Therefore, this paper presents an agile improvement system by using the action diagram and the enhanced chaotic neural network (ECNN) model, combining the merits of chaotic neural network, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and genetic algorithm in one consolidated model. It is expected that the proposed method will overcome most of the disadvantages of published models, particularly the accuracy of customer satisfaction model and the validity of modification decision. Also, it gives a chance to meet the demands of customers at an optimal cost and make the hard but necessary improvement decisions whenever they are required.

AB  - Real world manufacturing systems are usually constrained by both machine and human resources. Human operators are often the constraining resource and transfer between workstations to process jobs when required. This kind of system is known as a Dual Resource Constrained (DRC) system and presents additional technical challenges which must be considered during planning and scheduling. These technical challenges can be categorised into the five main dimensions of job release mechanisms, job dispatching, worker flexibility, worker assignment and transfer costs. This paper aims to provide an overview of recent developments in DRC research concerned with each of these areas and also discusses some possible approaches to solving the resource scheduling problem in a DRC system. The focus is on materials published after 1995 and up to 2009. Previous reviews on DRC systems are commented on and followed by a review of recent works associated with each of the five dimensions of DRC system research. Advancements made and new methodologies proposed are discussed and future research directions are identified.

AB  - The frequently used methods of handling optimism and pessimism in multiple criteria decision analysis are Hurwicz’s and Yager’s approaches. Despite their wide usage, a critical issue has been raised about unidimensionality. Numerous psychological researches and empirical findings have convincingly supported that optimism and pessimism do not represent opposite poles on a single, bipolar dimension, but they are conceived as two partially independent dimensions instead. The focus of this paper is a two-dimensional approach by adequately employing the degrees of membership and non-membership based on Atanassov fuzzy sets. This study develops optimistic and pessimistic estimations with several fuzzy point operators to draw the influences of optimism and pessimism on multicriteria decision making for the sake of a better fit than the unidimensional model. Given a typology from empirical grounds, the appropriate point operators specific to each type are suggested to identify adaptational outcomes. Base upon a series of new score functions, a useful method for multiple criteria decision analysis is provided to efficiently facilitate decision analysis with a multimeasure approach. Feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods are illustrated by a practical example.

AB  - Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) proves to be a very useful methodology for multiple criteria decision-making in fuzzy environments, which has found substantial applications in recent years. The vast majority of the applications use a crisp point estimate method such as the extent analysis or the fuzzy preference programming (FPP) based nonlinear method for fuzzy AHP priority derivation. The extent analysis has been revealed to be invalid and the weights derived by this method do not represent the relative importance of decision criteria or alternatives. The FPP-based nonlinear priority method also turns out to be subject to significant drawbacks, one of which is that it may produce multiple, even conflict priority vectors for a fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix, leading to entirely different conclusions. To address these drawbacks and provide a valid yet practical priority method for fuzzy AHP, this paper proposes a logarithmic fuzzy preference programming (LFPP) based methodology for fuzzy AHP priority derivation, which formulates the priorities of a fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix as a logarithmic nonlinear programming and derives crisp priorities from fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices. Numerical examples are tested to show the advantages of the proposed methodology and its potential applications in fuzzy AHP decision-making.

AB  - In recent years, providing the required criteria put forward for the full membership by the union is one of the prior targets of Turkey in the European Union full membership process. The objective of this study is to be able to evaluate situations of the membership process among European countries, candidate countries and Turkey. In the data set used in the period of 2005-2010, it is seen that the global economic crisis becoming efficient towards the end of 2007 has affected both EU countries and candidate countries economically. This period which included the effect of global crisis was taken as a data set to the study in order to add the effect of global crisis into the evaluation. The study was tried to be analyzed by using artificial neural networks and decision trees algorithms by means of a variety of economic signs. For that purpose, the data between years of 2005-2010 were used in this study. Primarily, the relative importance of independent variables was found by means of multilayered artificial neural networks and then dimension reduction operation was done. The criteria thought as affecting the membership was tried to be found out by using the decision trees method.

AB  - The present work concerns the parametric study and optimization of regenerative Clausius and organic Rankine cycles (ORC) with two feedwater heaters. For the parametric optimization, thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency and specific work are selected as the objective functions, so the mentioned parameters are calculated for different values of the outlet pressures from the second and third pumps by using EES (Engineering Equation Solver) software. Aiming at optimizing these functions, a procedure based on artificial neural network (ANN) and artificial bees colony (ABC) is proposed. The procedure includes two stages. According to the obtained data from the parametric analysis, in the first stage three different multi-layer perceptron neural networks are trained. In the next stage, three distinct artificial neural networks are used to optimize the specific network, the thermal efficiency and the exergy efficiency. Variables and fitness functions in these algorithms are the inputs and the outputs of the corresponding trained neural network, respectively. This optimization process is applied to water for a Clausius Rankine cycle and also to R717 for an ORC. It is shown that some interesting features among optimal objective functions and decision variables involved in this power cycle can be discovered consequently.

AB  - The development of bio-refineries has become a relevant topic in the EU's agenda. However, the promotion of a new industry in rural areas is typically hindered by the scarcity of human capital, lack of information, infrastructures, and competing interests. In this context, public support is unavoidable to assist promotion of this innovative sector. The various policy options reveal some strengths and drawbacks, posing the problem of finding the best trade-off to public decision makers. In this paper we aim at developing a methodology to support policy decision making within the biorefinery framework, with the purpose of determining a way to identify the most suitable policy option given the actual uncertainty in developing the bio-refinery industry in rural areas. The empirical experiment, based on a simulation of the enforcement of four identified policy instruments, highlights that, although subsidies and incentives to profitability of dedicated crops appear to have the greatest effects on the development of bio-refinery, the best performances are exhibited by technological innovation and information options.

AB  - Recently, resolving the problem of evaluation and ranking the potential suppliers has become as a key strategic factor for business firms. With the development of intelligent and automated information systems in the information era, the need for more efficient decision making methods is growing. The VIKOR method was developed to solve multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems with conflicting and non-commensurable criteria assuming that compromising is acceptable to resolve conflicts. On the other side objective weights based on Shannon entropy concept could be used to regulate subjective weights assigned by decision makers or even taking into account the end-users’ opinions. In this paper, we treat supplier selection as a group multiple criteria decision making (GMCDM) problem and obtain decision makers’ opinions in the form of linguistic terms. Then, these linguistic terms are converted to trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. We extended the VIKOR method with a mechanism to extract and deploy objective weights based on Shannon entropy concept. The final result is obtained through next steps based on factors R, S and Q. A numerical example is proposed to illustrate an application of the proposed method.

AB  - Landslides cause damages and harms to human lives. Proper analysis and suitable modeling of these dangers may reduce relative losses. It even prevents mass movements. The Zab river basin is susceptible to landslide. To evaluate the landslide risks in the study area, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method and geographical information systems (GIS) as well as local data were used. The local data includes: slope, slope aspect, distance to road, distance to drainage network, land use and land cover, geological factors, geomorphologic characteristics and climatic condition of area. The use of AHP model resulted in providing a real country image indicating initial susceptibility to the landslide. Based on findings southern basins are most susceptible to landslide.

KW  - Multiple objective optimization,
KW  - post-Pareto analysis
AB  - Multiple objective optimization involves the simultaneous optimization of several objective functions. Solving this type of problem involves two stages; the optimization stage and the post-Pareto analysis stage. The first stage focuses in obtaining a set of nondominated solutions while the second one involves the selection of one solution from the Pareto set. Most of the work found in the literature focuses in the first stage. However, the decision making stage is as important as obtaining the set of nondominated solutions. Selecting one solution over others, or reducing the number of alternatives to choose from is not a simple task since the Pareto-optimal set can potentially contain a very large number of solutions. This paper introduces the dynamic self organizing tree algorithm as a method to perform post-Pareto analysis. This algorithm offers two main advantages: there is no need to provide an initial number of clusters, and at each hierarchical level, the algorithm optimizes the number of clusters, and can reassign data from previous hierarchical levels in order to rearrange misclustered data. The proposed method is tested in a well-known multiple objective optimization problem in order to show the performance of the algorithm.

AB  - A method to restore stochastic monotonicity of noisy multi-criteria data sets through relabeling is presented. By formulating the problem as a weighted maximum independent set problem on a comparability graph, it is possible to compute optimal relabelings w.r.t. cumulative label frequency loss function. We demonstrate how to formulate the problem in this manner and discuss why it requires objects to be relabeled instead of deleted. More precisely, we will formulate the zero-one cumulative label frequency loss, L1 cumulative label frequency loss and squared cumulative label frequency loss, and provide a weighing function for each. We investigate these loss functions in the related context of restoring regular monotonicity, dealing with objects with a single label, rather than distributions. Finally, we provide applications on some closely related example data sets and discuss some interesting findings.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a dominance-based fuzzy rough set approach for the decision analysis of a preference-ordered uncertain or possibilistic data table, which is comprised of a finite set of objects described by a finite set of criteria. The domains of the criteria may have ordinal properties that express preference scales. In the proposed approach, we first compute the degree of dominance between any two objects based on their imprecise evaluations with respect to each criterion. This results in a valued dominance relation on the universe. Then, we define the degree of adherence to the dominance principle by every pair of objects and the degree of consistency of each object. The consistency degrees of all objects are aggregated to derive the quality of the classification, which we use to define the reducts of a data table. In addition, the upward and downward unions of decision classes are fuzzy subsets of the universe. Thus, the lower and upper approximations of the decision classes based on the valued dominance relation are fuzzy rough sets. By using the lower approximations of the decision classes, we can derive two types of decision rules that can be applied to new decision cases.

The results on a dataset are provided, together with the comparisons in terms of classification accuracy between the proposed approach and other methods that used the same dataset, including logistic regression, decision tree, neural networks, neuro-fuzzy classification, ant colony optimisation, memory-based reasoning, and ensemble model.

AB  - The need for trading off interpretability and accuracy is intrinsic to the use of fuzzy systems. The obtaining of accurate but also human-comprehensible fuzzy systems played a key role in Zadeh and Mamdani’s seminal ideas and system identification methodologies. Nevertheless, before the advent of soft computing, accuracy progressively became the main concern of fuzzy model builders, making the resulting fuzzy systems get closer to black-box models such as neural networks. Fortunately, the fuzzy modeling scientific community has come back to its origins by considering design techniques dealing with the interpretability-accuracy tradeoff. In particular, the use of genetic fuzzy systems has been widely extended thanks to their inherent flexibility and their capability to jointly consider different optimization criteria. The current contribution constitutes a review on the most representative genetic fuzzy systems relying on Mamdani-type fuzzy rule-based systems to obtain interpretable linguistic fuzzy models with a good accuracy.

AB  - The purpose of spatial modelling in animal and public health is three-fold: describing existing spatial patterns of risk, attempting to understand the biological mechanisms that lead to disease occurrence and predicting what will happen in the medium to long-term future (temporal prediction) or in different geographical areas (spatial prediction). Traditional methods for temporal and spatial predictions include general and generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM) and Bayesian estimation methods. However, such models require both disease presence and absence data which are not always easy to obtain. Novel spatial modelling methods such as maximum entropy (MAXENT) and the genetic algorithm for rule set production (GARP) require only disease presence data and have been used extensively in the fields of ecology and conservation, to model species distribution and habitat suitability. Other methods, such as multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), use knowledge of the causal factors of disease occurrence to identify areas potentially suitable for disease. In addition to their less restrictive data requirements, some of these novel methods have been shown to outperform traditional statistical methods in predictive ability (Elith et al., 2006). This review paper provides details of some of these novel methods for mapping disease distribution, highlights their advantages and limitations, and identifies studies which have used the methods to model various aspects of disease distribution.

AB  - Inherent complexity and uncertainty in a business environment necessitate the participation of many experts in multi criteria decision making. However, participation of many experts makes the conflict aggregation process difficult. To handle this difficulty, we propose two algorithms namely possibility measure and averaging conflict aggregation. In possibility measure, we integrate the possibility theory of fuzzy logic with a maximal containment method that is designed based on the decision problem. Possibility measure algorithm for ME-MCDM involves computationally expensive multiple information processing steps. Therefore to test and compare this algorithm, averaging conflict aggregation algorithm is proposed that requires fewer mathematical information processing steps. Based on the proposed algorithms, a decision support system (DSS) is developed. We present a case study of supplier evaluation to compare both of the proposed algorithms with the help of developed DSS.

AB  - Urbanization induces detrimental effects on the eco-environment that are beginning to be extensively described. However, the adoption of suitable indicators and reliable methods still requires attention to provide a basis for a more accurate understanding of eco-environmental effects from urbanization. The aggregated index system representing the coupling relationships between urbanization and eco-environment was introduced and an integrated sustainable development approach (ISD) to simulate and evaluate the integrative effects was developed in this paper. The ISD consists of modules of the coupling relationship assessments, systematic analysis of potential eco-environmental changes, and sustainability evaluation. An interpretative structural modeling (ISM) and grey relative technique (GRT) are used to analyze the systematical structure and assess the coupling relationships. A system dynamics model (SD) and artificial neural network (ANN) are used to simulate the potential environmental changes and compare the sustainability, respectively. An application study of Jiangsu province in China was performed, where the general eco-environmental integrity is under significant urbanization pressure. The potential eco-environmental scenarios from 2010 to 2015 under natural, populated, economic, spatial and social urbanization patterns were simulated and analyzed. The result reveals that the urbanization sustainability may be met on condition that either populated urbanization or social urbanization pattern is adopted in Jiangsu province, China. The aggregated indexes and ISD may help local authorities better understand and address the complex coupling relationship, and develop improved regional environmental management strategies that better balance urbanization and eco-environmental conservation.

AB  - This paper proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to assessing work zone casualty risk defined as the likelihood of a vehicle occupant being killed or injured in a work zone crash. The proposed GA approach consists of three components: chromosome coding, fitness function and genetic operators. Based on the Michigan M-94⧹I-94⧹I-94BL⧹I-94BR highway work zone crash data, 19 classification rules are identified using the proposed GA approach to determine the work zone casualty risk. The results show that the variable of seat position has the most significant effect on reducing the prediction error of the GA approach. The variables of posted speed limit, traffic control devices and truck or bus involved are found to have no effects on improving the prediction performance. The GA approach outperforms the binary logistic regression technique in terms of the prediction accuracy. This demonstrates that the GA approach is a good alternative for the work zone casualty risk assessment.

AB  - Today, organizations that wish to carry on the sustainable growing need a robust strategic performance measurement and evaluation system because of changing demands of consumers, reduced product life cycle, competitive and globalised markets. In this study, a new methodology is introduced and proposed for increasing the supplier selection and evaluation quality. The new approach considers both qualitative and quantitative variables in evaluating performance for selection of suppliers based on efficiency and effectiveness in one of the biggest car manufacturing factory in Turkey. This new methodology is realized in two steps. In the first stage, qualitative performance evaluation is performed by using fuzzy AHP (Analytical Hierarchical Process) in finding criteria weights and then fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is utilized in finding the ranking of suppliers. So, qualitative variables are transformed into a quantitative variable for using in DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) methodology as an output called quality management system audit. In the second stage, DEA is performed with one dummy input and four output variables, namely, quality management system audit, warranty cost ratio, defect ratio, quality management. As a result, comparing with the present system applied by the car factory, the new method seems to be some advantages and superiorities for making the decision in buying the quality car luggage side part (panel) by selecting the suitable supplier(s) in an automotive factory of Turkey.

AB  - The contemporary manufacturing organisations are forced to adopt advanced manufacturing paradigms for sustaining in the global markets. Supply chain management is an essential ingredient of advanced manufacturing systems since outsourcing gains vital importance. Supplier selection is a vital issue concerned in the process of managing global supply chains. A conceptual model for supplier selection encompassing various criteria and sub-criteria has been developed. In this article, fuzzy analytic network process (fuzzy ANP) approach has been used for the supplier selection process. The case study has been carried out in an Indian electronics switches manufacturing company. Based on supplier selection weighted index, the best supplier has been determined. This is followed by the conduct of sensitivity analysis as well as questionnaire-based validation. The results of the validation study indicated that the application of fuzzy ANP is practically feasible and adaptable in the contemporary industrial scenario.

AB  - This paper considers the design and the practical implementation of a stable multiple objective real-time scheduling problem for a complex production system. In this paper, a complex production system is viewed as a kind of systems producing a variety of products (multiple-part-type) under constraints and multiple production objectives often conflicting. Previously, fuzzy control theory and fuzzy intervals arithmetic have been used to develop a distributed and supervised continuous-flow control architecture. In this framework, the objective of the distributed control structure is to balance the production process by adjusting the continuous production rates of the machines on the basis of the average local behavior. The supervisory control methodology aims at maintaining the overall performances within acceptable limits. In the new proposed approach, the problem of a stable real-time scheduling of jobs is considered at the shop-floor level. In this context, as the stability of the control structure is ensured, the actual dispatching times are determined from the continuous production rates through a discretization procedure. To deal with conflicts between jobs at a shared machine, a decision is made. It concerns the actual part to be processed and uses some criterions representing a measure of the job's priority. The simulation results show the validity of the proposed approach in terms of production cost, robustness and system stability.

The serious problem in gas distribution companies is the increasing peak and valley rate, which is becoming more lethal one while the upstream pipeline companies change the gas price from one step to two steps. This paper finds a comparable good solution to promote dual-fuel burner on gas consumer market, building an interruptible part in demand side which is a better way that can make the gas company to accommodate the balance between supply and demand more effectively. The technical feasibility and some foreign gas company experience related to this sector are also discussed.

Various social, political, topographic, and geographic factors were used as predictors of land-use change, including elevation, slope, aspect, distance from roads and urban areas, road ratio, land use, environmental score, and legal restrictions. Then, LSI maps were created using FR, AHP, LR, and ANN approaches, and significance and correlation were examined among the models using relative operating characteristic (ROC), overall accuracy, and kappa analyses. The ROC analyses gave results of 0.940, 0.937, 0.922, and 0.891 for the LR, FR, AHP, and ANN LSI maps, respectively. The highest correlation was found between the LR and AHP LSI maps (0.816911), and the lowest correlation was between the ANN and FR LSI maps (0.759701). The ANN approach produced the highest overall accuracy at 92.3%, followed by 91.74% for FR, 89.12% for AHP, and 88.93% for LR. In the kappa analysis, the highest Kˆ statistic was 45.38% for FR, followed by 40.84% for ANN, 30 representing the city area, the ANN method had a relatively high value of 71.71%, and the FR, LR, and AHP methods had similar accuracies of 57.68, 55.05, and 54.31%, respectively. These results indicate that the FR, AHP, LR, and ANN approaches produced similar LSI maps for Korea.

Besides the individual best position and the global best position, a nominal average position of the swarm is introduced in IPSO. The performance of IPSO is compared to different PSO variants with five well-known benchmark functions. The experimental results show that the proposed IPSO algorithm improves the searching performance on the benchmark functions. And then, IPSO, as well as other PSO variants, is applied to optimal tuning of Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) gains for a typical PID control system of water turbine governor. The computer simulation results of an actual hydro power plant in China show that IPSO algorithm has stable convergence characteristic and good computational ability, and it is an effective and easily implemented method for optimal tuning of PID gains of water turbine governor.

AB  - Credit risk analysis has long attracted a great deal of attention from both academic researchers and practitioners. However, because of the recent financial crisis, this field continues to draw ever increasingly attention. A multiple kernels multi-criteria programming approach based on evolution strategy (ES-MK-MCP) is proposed for credit decision making in this study. We introduce a linear combination of kernel functions to enhance the interpretability of credit classification models, and propose an alternative to optimize the parameters based on the evolution strategy. For illustration purpose, two UCI credit card data sets are used to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model. As the experimental results reveal, the proposed ES-MK-MCP model is an efficient tool for credit risk analysis, especially for decision makers to identify the most relevant features.

Users are forced to deal with an overwhelming number of possibilities, and continuously make decisions if they want to obtain meaningful information or services. The paper describes an approach for a simple yet effective selection of the most suitable information and web services that fit user’s needs. The novelty of the approach is twofold: the concept of lexicographical preferences is distinctively used for a multi-criteria decision-making; a simple mechanism of representing user’s criterion satisfaction levels is proposed. The lexicographic preferences allow for mimicking user’s attitude that some criteria should be satisfied before other criteria are considered. The criterion satisfaction levels are defined with a single threshold that represents a boundary value between acceptable and unacceptable values of attributes of alternatives. The paper includes results of case studies preformed on a prototype of a web selection system built using the proposed approach.

Since most similar evaluations are multi-objection problems, which both DEA and AHP are capable of solving, the integration of these two approaches is shown to be even more powerful. The proposed integrated DEA/AHP model can evaluate and rank different alternatives. In addition, a time-scale comparison of the economic performances of local governments in China was carried out using the malmquist productivity index (MPI), which indicated that there is a trend of economic growth. However, empirical results indicate that after discounting the advantages of location and political connections, the east district provinces of China do not have superior economic performance or a better MPI index, as compared with other districts. This result is contrary to our original hypothesis.

The aim of this paper is to introduce a methodology based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to train the Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) method PROAFTN. PSO is an efficient evolutionary optimization algorithm using the social behavior of living organisms to explore the search space. It is a relatively new population-based metaheuristic that can be used to find approximate solutions to difficult optimization problems. Furthermore, it is easy to code and robust to control parameters. To apply PROAFTN, the values of several parameters need to be determined prior to classification, such as boundaries of intervals and weights. In this study, the proposed technique is named PSOPRO, which utilizes PSO to elicit the PROAFTN parameters from examples during the learning process. To test the effectiveness of the methodology and the quality of the obtained models, PSOPRO is evaluated on 12 public-domain datasets and compared with the previous work applied on PROAFTN. The computational results demonstrate that PSOPRO is very competitive with respect to the most common classification algorithms.

AB  - The selection of assets in which to invest money is of critical importance in the finance industry, and is rendered very treacherous because of the inherent market fluctuations, and the connections with the Economy, and major world events. Because of the high dimensionality of the problem of selecting an optimal portfolio (in the financial sense of, a portfolio outperforming other portfolios), and the large amount of data available, intelligent systems (e.g. artificial intelligence techniques, machine learning approaches) are a natural approach to tackle this problem, from a computational standpoint. Numerous techniques have been developed to combine the values of return, risk, and other characteristics of an asset. However, the majority of techniques that have been used to construct a portfolio, tend to ignore dependencies among the characteristics of an asset. Moreover, most of the techniques assume that all available data are precise, which is not the case since, for instance, the expected return of an asset is a prediction of future behavior. To address these drawbacks, it was proposed in Magoc, Modave, Ceberio, and Kreinovich (2009) to use non-additive (or fuzzy) methods. Fuzzy methods outperformed other techniques, at least in the case of the Shanghai market, where full disclosure of information is assumed. In this paper, we give an intuition why fuzzy approach performs very well in this particular finance problem.

AB  - In this paper, we present a generic method/model for multi-objective design optimization of laminated composite components, based on Vector Evaluated Artificial Bee Colony (VEABC) algorithm. VEABC is a parallel vector evaluated type, swarm intelligence multi-objective variant of the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (ABC). In the current work a modified version of VEABC algorithm for discrete variables has been developed and implemented successfully for the multi-objective design optimization of composites. The problem is formulated with multiple objectives of minimizing weight and the total cost of the composite component to achieve a specified strength. The primary optimization variables are the number of layers, its stacking sequence (the orientation of the layers) and thickness of each layer. The classical lamination theory is utilized to determine the stresses in the component and the design is evaluated based on three failure criteria: failure mechanism based failure criteria, maximum stress failure criteria and the tsai-wu failure criteria. The optimization method is validated for a number of different loading configurations—uniaxial, biaxial and bending loads. The design optimization has been carried for both variable stacking sequences, as well fixed standard stacking schemes and a comparative study of the different design configurations evolved has been presented. Finally the performance is evaluated in comparison with other nature inspired techniques which includes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Immune System (AIS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The performance of ABC is at par with that of PSO, AIS and GA for all the loading configurations.

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to conduct a comparative study of score functions in multiple criteria decision analysis based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The concept of score functions has been conceptualized and widely applied to multi-criteria decision-making problems. There are several types of score functions that can identify the mixed results of positive and negative parts in a bi-dimensional framework of intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Considering various perspectives on score functions, the present study adopts an order of preference based on similarity to the ideal solution as the main structure to estimate the importance of different criteria and compute optimal multi-criteria decisions in intuitionistic fuzzy evaluation settings. An experimental analysis is conducted to examine the relationship between the results yielded by different score functions, considering the average Spearman correlation coefficients and contradiction rates. Furthermore, additional discussions clarify the relative differences in the ranking orders obtained from different combinations of numbers of alternatives and criteria as well as different importance conditions.

It combines the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to estimate the selected evaluation criteria weights with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for spatial data analysis that avoids the subjectivity of the judgements of decision makers in establishing the influences between some criteria or clusters of criteria. An innovative feature of the method lies in incorporating the environmental impact assessment of the plant operation as a criterion in the decision-making process itself rather than as an a posteriori assessment. Moreover, a two-scale approach is considered. At a global scale an initial screening identifies inter-municipal zones satisfying the decisive requirements (socio-economic, technical and environmental issues, with weights respectively, of 48%, 41% and 11%). A detailed suitability ranking inside the previously identified zones is then performed at a local scale in two phases and includes environmental assessment of the plant operation. Those zones are ranked by combining the non-environmental feasibility of Phase 1 (with a weight of 75%) with the environmental assessment of the plant operation impact of Phase 2 (with a weight of 25%). The reliability and robustness of the presented methodology as a decision supporting tool is assessed through a sensitivity analysis. The results proved the system effectiveness in the ranking process.

AB  - Fuzzy theory has been regarded as a very important technique for quality management (QM) of distributed manufacturing system and attracts the attentions of academic and industry; however, there is a lack of a comprehensive literature review and a classification scheme for it. This paper is the first academic literature review of the fuzzy theory applied in quality management of distributed manufacturing system. It involves five most popular databases in this research area and covers more than 20 journals, proposes a classification scheme using clustering analysis method. Sixty-one journal articles were finally selected, reviewed and classified. Each selected article was classified firstly based on four QM dimensions (quality planning, quality control, quality assurance and quality improvement) and the elements/process of each dimension. Sequentially, articles were further classified by the nine fuzzy techniques which are fuzzy regression, fuzzy classification, fuzzy clustering, fuzzy control, fuzzy inference, fuzzy numbers, fuzzy optimization, fuzzy statistics and fuzzy data analysis. Among the four QM dimensions, quality improvement has the highest publications in recent years and fuzzy decision making and fuzzy number are the main techniques adopted in quality improvement.

AB  - In this paper, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making model is presented based on a feed forward artificial neural network. This model is used to capture and represent the decision makers' preferences. The topology of the neural network model is developed to train the model. The proposed model can use historical data and update the database information for alternatives over time for future decisions. Basically, multi-criteria decision making problems are formulated, and neural network is used to learn the relation among criteria and alternatives and rank the alternatives. We do not use any utility function for the modeling; however, a unique method is proposed for eliciting the information from decision makers. The proposed model is applicable for a wide variety of multi-attribute decision making problems and can be used for future ranking or selection without managers' judgment effort. Simulation of the managers' decisions is demonstrated in detail and the design and implementation of the model are illustrated by a case study.

AB  - Energy is a vital input for social and economic development. As a result of the generalization of agricultural, industrial and domestic activities the demand for energy has increased remarkably, especially in emergent countries. This has meant rapid grower in the level of greenhouse gas emissions and the increase in fuel prices, which are the main driving forces behind efforts to utilize renewable energy sources more effectively, i.e. energy which comes from natural resources and is also naturally replenished. Despite the obvious advantages of renewable energy, it presents important drawbacks, such as the discontinuity of generation, as most renewable energy resources depend on the climate, which is why their use requires complex design, planning and control optimization methods. Fortunately, the continuous advances in computer hardware and software are allowing researchers to deal with these optimization problems using computational resources, as can be seen in the large number of optimization methods that have been applied to the renewable and sustainable energy field. This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in computational optimization methods applied to renewable and sustainable energy, offering a clear vision of the latest research advances in this field.

KW  - Relational information system
AB  - Attribute reduction is very important in rough set-based data analysis (RSDA) because it can be used to simplify the induced decision rules without reducing the classification accuracy. The notion of reduct plays a key role in rough set-based attribute reduction. In rough set theory, a reduct is generally defined as a minimal subset of attributes that can classify the same domain of objects as unambiguously as the original set of attributes. Nevertheless, from a relational perspective, RSDA relies on a kind of dependency principle. That is, the relationship between the class labels of a pair of objects depends on component-wise comparison of their condition attributes. The larger the number of condition attributes compared, the greater the probability that the dependency will hold. Thus, elimination of condition attributes may cause more object pairs to violate the dependency principle. Based on this observation, a reduct can be defined alternatively as a minimal subset of attributes that does not increase the number of objects violating the dependency principle. While the alternative definition coincides with the original one in ordinary RSDA, it is more easily generalized to cases of fuzzy RSDA and relational data analysis.

AB  - This paper reports on the design and implementation of a multi-methodology intervention intended to support a budget prioritisation decision by a multi-organisational group tasked with tackling the problem of teenage pregnancy in an English borough. The intervention approach involved the combined use of cognitive/causal mapping and a multi-criteria decision analysis method to develop and prioritise a number of projects aimed at alleviating issues associated with teenage pregnancy. The paper describes and discusses the process of developing and applying the intervention approach, and provides an evaluation of its perceived impact by the client group. Drawing on the rich seam of data gathered over the course of our work with the multi-organisational group, we explore the varying degrees of impact that the mapping and multi-criteria evaluation methods achieved during and after the intervention. Analysis of the intervention data suggests that both methods were perceived to facilitate a different way of thinking and learning. In addition, we find that the mapping and multi-criteria evaluation methods successfully addressed participants' democratic and rational concerns. However, despite these reported positive effects, the full recommendations of the intervention were not implemented. An attempt is made to explain this outcome in terms of both the multi-organisational context within which the intervention took place and the nature of the group task. Directions for further research are then proposed.

AB  - Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a machine learning technique of high performance in classification problems, and it is also a chief method in predicting business failure. Recently, several techniques have been introduced into the life-cycle of CBR for business failure prediction (BFP). The drawback of former researches on CBR-based BFP is that they only use total predictive accuracy when assessing CBR. In this research, we provide evidence on performance of CBR in Chinese BFP from various views of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative values. Data are collected from Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China. And we present how data are preprocessed from the view of data mining. The classical CBR model on the base of Euclidean metric, the grey CBR model on the base of grey coefficient metric, and the pseudo CBR model on the base of pseudo outranking relations are employed to make a comparative study on CBR's predictive performance in BFP. Meanwhile, support vector machine (SVM) is employed to be a baseline model for comparison. The results indicate that pseudo CBR produces better performance in Chinese BFP than classical CBR and grey CBR significantly on the whole, and it outperforms SVM marginally by total predictive accuracy and sensitivity, while it is not significantly worse than SVM by specificity.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to aid just-in-time (JIT) manufacturers in selecting the most appropriate suppliers and in evaluating supplier performance. Many manufacturers employ the JIT philosophy in order to be more competitive in today’s global market. The success of JIT on the production floor has led many firms to expand the JIT philosophy to the entire supply chain. The procurement of parts and materials is a very important issue in the successful and effective implementation of JIT; thus, supplier selection and performance evaluation in long-term relationships have became more critical in JIT production environments. The proposed systems can assist manufacturers in handling these issues. In this research, neural network based supplier selection and supplier performance evaluation systems are presented. The proposed approach is not limited to JIT supply. It can assist manufacturers in selecting the most appropriate suppliers and in evaluating supplier performance. The proposed neural network based systems are tested with data taken from an automotive factory, and the results show that the proposed systems can be used effectively.

AB  - Making decisions on strategic investments, such as early stage manufacturing technology (MT), is a complicated task. Early stage technologies are usually costly, and surrounded by uncertainty. The potential benefits are often hard to quantify prior to implementation. Thus, how could managers make good decisions in a high-risk, technically complex business when the information they need to make those decisions comes largely from the project champions who are competing against one another for resources? Traditionally, in this problem domain, decisions are made based upon gut-feeling and past experience, sometimes with the support of some multi-criteria decision-support tools. The criteria evaluation process is very subjective and relies heavily on managers’ experience, knowledge, as well as intuition. Thus, the evaluation approach is often not effectively carried out as there is lack of visibility and traceability in the decision making process. The impact of this scenario is that managers are not confident that resources are being optimised and applied to a mixed portfolio of projects to maximise benefits. This paper proposes a marginal analysis directed branch and bound approach for evaluating and selecting early stage manufacturing technology (MT) projects. A case study is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed approach. Implications of the proposed approach to practitioners and academia are discussed and future research outlined.

An empirical study based on 75 assets of New York stock exchange (NYSE) is considered for in sample and out of sample analysis to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed model. The results show the high performance of fuzzy portfolios comparing with the performance of crisp portfolios and S&P 500 index.

AB  - In recent years, numerous attempts have been made to reduce the global environmental and associated socio-economic impacts of construction activities to achieve sustainable development goals. A sustainable system or activity refers to an eco-friendly, cost effective and socio-politically viable solution. This paper utilizes triple-bottom-line (TBL) sustainability criteria for the selection of a sustainable flooring system in Tehran (Iran). Three types of block joisted flooring systems – concrete, clay, and expanded polystyrene (EPS) blocks – have been investigated using life cycle analysis (LCA). Proposed approach provides a comprehensive evaluation system based on TBL criteria that are further divided into thirteen sub-criteria. It includes: (1) Environmental concerns (resource depletion, waste and emissions, waste management, climate change, environmental risk, embodied energy and energy loss); (2) Economic concerns (material cost, construction cost, and occupation and maintenance cost); and (3) Socio-political issues (social acceptance, vulnerability of area, and building weight). Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used as a multi-criteria decision making technique that helps to aggregate the impacts of proposed (sub)criteria into a sustainability index (SI) through a five-level hierarchical structure. Integration of AHP and LCA provides a framework for robust decision making that is consistent with sustainable construction practices. A detailed analysis shows that the EPS block is the most sustainable solution for block joisted flooring system in Tehran.

Out of several generalizations of fuzzy set theory for various objectives, the notions of intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets are interesting and very useful in modeling real life problems. The ranking of fuzzy numbers was studied by many authors and it was extended to intuitionistic fuzzy sets because of its attraction and applicability. The ranking of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets plays a vital role in decision-making, data analysis, artificial intelligence and socioeconomic system where the interval analysis is essential. In this paper a new method for ranking interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets has been introduced and compared with other methods by numerical examples.

AB  - With regard to limits in budget, inevitably, one must choose prioritized projects in pavements rehabilitation and maintenance process. This paper looks into prioritization based upon a model including all effects of important factors like pavement condition index, traffic volume, road width as well as rehabilitation and maintenance cost. Since defining a model that introduces all those factors was difficult, a more advanced modeling named fuzzy logic was referred for the problem of prioritization. Although analytical hierarchy process can be used for decision making process as well, fuzzy modeling lets one have more precise choices for the outcome. Finally with the help of MATLAB software and coded M-files, inference engines such as Product engine, Dienes–Rescher and Lukasiewicz were all tested and the logical favorite separation for this application was found in product inference engine. As a case study some streets located in district No. 6 of Tehran municipality were selected and the favorite mathematical model was executed on those streets. This model was used for prioritizing these 131 sections.

By this means, data partitions obtained via different clustering techniques can be continuously refined (via selection and merging) by a population of fusion hierarchies having complementary validation indices as objective functions. To assess the potential of the novel framework in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, a series of systematic experiments, involving eleven variants of the proposed GP-based algorithm and a comparison with basic as well as advanced clustering methods (of which some are clustering ensembles and/or multi-objective in nature), have been conducted on a number of artificial, benchmark and bioinformatics datasets. Overall, the results corroborate the perspective that having fusion hierarchies operating on well-chosen subsets of data partitions is a fine strategy that may yield significant gains in terms of clustering robustness.

AB  - Grass biogas/biomethane has been put forward as a renewable energy solution and it has been shown to perform well in terms of energy balance, greenhouse gas emissions and policy constraints. Biofuel and energy crop solutions are country-specific and grass biomethane has strong potential in countries with temperate climates and a high proportion of grassland, such as Ireland. For a grass biomethane industry to develop in a country, suitable regions (i.e. those with the highest potential) must be identified. In this paper, factors specifically related to the assessment of the potential of a grass biogas/biomethane industry are identified and analysed. The potential for grass biogas and grass biomethane is determined on a county-by-county basis using multi-criteria decision analysis. Values are assigned to each county and ratings and weightings applied to determine the overall county potential. The potential for grass biomethane with co-digestion of slaughter waste (belly grass) is also determined. The county with the highest potential (Limerick) is analysed in detail and is shown to have ready potential for production of gaseous biofuel to meet either 50% of the vehicle fleet or 130% of the domestic natural gas demand, through 25 facilities at a scale of ca. 30ktyr−1 of feedstock. The assessment factors developed in this paper can be used in other resource studies into grass biomethane or other energy crops.

KW  - Multiple objective optimization
KW  - post-Pareto analysis
AB  - Most real-world engineering optimization problems are implicitly or explicitly multi-objective, and approaches to find the best feasible solution to be implemented can be quite challenging for the decision-maker. In this kind of problem, either the analyst determines a single solution or identifies a set of nondominated solutions, often referred to as Pareto-optimal set. Although, several methods for solving multi-objective optimization problems have been developed and studied, little prior work has been done on the evaluation of results obtained in multi-objective optimization. This selection stage is often referred as post-Pareto optimality. This paper presents a method based on preferences rankings provided from the decision-maker. The method is clearly advantageous because there is no need to provide specific weight values; the only requirement is to provide a non-nominal ranking. Several examples are used to show the performance of the algorithm.

AB  - This research provides an analytical tool, fuzzy decision support system (FDSS), to find the precedence of jeopardy in occupations spawning shoulder and neck pain (SNP), an important musculoskeletal disorder and the most ubiquitous pain complaint in an occupational environment. FDSS evaluates and prioritizes the relative importance of the imprecise, uncertain and vague nature of risk factors causing occupational SNP. The objective involves derivation of mechanical-, physical- and psychosocial-related risk categories using knowledge acquisition implemented by identifying the risk factors through literature analysis, conventional and concept mapping interviews with expert neurologists, orthopedists, psychologists and physiotherapists. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is applied as an evaluation tool to measure the significance of the risk factors in each occupation. The results indicate that the proposed system supplements SNP diagnosis experts with more precise key decision support information. This assists health care organizations to systematically identify appropriate occupations that grounds high risk for the occurrence of SNP and so the curative practices can be executed effectively.

AB  - Outranking relation theory has been widely used to study pattern classification. Here we propose a classification method with concepts from the flows used in PROMETHEE methods, which are extensively applied in multi-criteria decision aids. PROMETHEE uses a flow, generated on the basis of a preference index and measured by various preference functions for each criterion, to represent the preference intensity for one pattern over another pattern. However, only criteria that are concordant with the preference contribute to a preference index. In the present study, the opinions from discordant criteria are also taken into account. The proposed method newly defines an overall preference index using both concordance and discordance relations for ordinal sorting problems. The final classification decision for a new pattern depends on its net flow. The criteria weights are determined using a genetic-algorithm-based approach. Empirical results obtained for a real-world problem regarding bankruptcy prediction demonstrate that the proposed method performs well compared to other well-known classification methods.

AB  - Risk and return are interdependent in a stock portfolio. To achieve the anticipated return, comparative risk should be considered simultaneously. However, complex investment environments and dynamic change in decision making criteria complicate forecasts of risk and return for various investment objects. Additionally, investors often fail to maximize their profits because of improper capital allocation. Although stock investment involves multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), traditional MCDM theory has two shortfalls: first, it is inappropriate for decisions that evolve with a changing environment; second, weight assignments for various criteria are often oversimplified and inconsistent with actual human thinking processes. In 1965, Rechenberg proposed evolution strategies for solving optimization problems involving real number parameters and addressed several flaws in traditional algorithms, such as their use of point search only and their high probability of falling into optimal solution area. In 1992, Hillis introduced the co-evolutionary concept that the evolution of living creatures is interactive with their environments (multi-criteria) and constantly improves the survivability of their genes, which then expedites evolutionary computation. Therefore, this research aimed to solve multi-criteria decision making problems of stock trading investment by integrating evolutionary strategies into the co-evolutionary criteria evaluation model. Since co-evolution strategies are self-calibrating, criteria evaluation can be based on changes in time and environment. Such changes not only correspond with human decision making patterns (i.e., evaluation of dynamic changes in criteria), but also address the weaknesses of multi-criteria decision making (i.e., simplified assignment of weights for various criteria). Co-evolutionary evolution strategies can identify the optimal capital portfolio and can help investors maximize their returns by optimizing the preoperational allocation of limited capital. This experimental study compared general evolution strategies with artificial neural forecast model, and found that co-evolutionary evolution strategies outperform general evolution strategies and substantially outperform artificial neural forecast models. The co-evolutionary criteria evaluation model avoids the problem of oversimplified adaptive functions adopted by general algorithms and the problem of favoring weights but failing to adaptively adjust to environmental change, which is a major limitation of traditional multi-criteria decision making. Doing so allows adaptation of various criteria in response to changes in various capital allocation chromosomes. Capital allocation chromosomes in the proposed model also adapt to various criteria and evolve in ways that resemble thinking patterns.

AB  - A generative CAD based design exploration method is proposed. It is suitable for complex multi-criteria design problems where important performance criteria are uncomputable. The method is based on building a genotype of the design within a history based parametric CAD system and then, varying its parameters randomly within pre-defined limits to generate a set of distinctive designs. The generated designs are then filtered through various constraint envelopes representing geometric viability, manufacturability, cost and other performance related constraints, thus reducing the vast design space into a smaller viable design space represented by a set of distinctive designs. These designs may then be further developed by the designer. The proposed generative design method makes minimal imposition on the designer’s work process and maintains both flexibility and fluidity that is required for creative design exploration. Its ability to work seamlessly with current CAD based design practices from early conceptual to detailed design is demonstrated. The design philosophy behind this generative method and the key steps involved in its implementation are presented with examples.

KW  - Similarities to positive and negative ideal cases
AB  - Case-based reasoning (CBR) solves many real-world problems under the assumption that similar observations have similar outputs. As an implementation of this assumption and inspired by the technique for order performance by the similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), this paper proposes a new type of multiple criteria CBR method for binary business failure prediction (BFP) with similarities to positive and negative ideal cases (SPNIC). Assuming that the binary prediction of business failure generates two results, i.e., failure and non-failure, we set the principle of this CBR forecasting method which is termed as SPNIC-based CBR as follows: new observations should have the same output as the positive or negative ideal case to which they are more similar. From the perspective of CBR, the SPNIC-based CBR forecasting method consists of R4 processes: retrieving positive and negative ideal cases, reusing solutions of ideal cases to forecast, retain cases, and reconstruct the case base. As a demonstration, we applied this method to forecast business failure in China with three data representations of a formerly collected dataset from normal economic environment and a representation of a recently collected dataset from financial crisis environment. The results indicate that this new CBR forecasting method can produce significantly better short-term discriminate capability than comparative methods, except for support vector machine, in normal economic environment; On the contrary, it cannot produce acceptable performance in financial crisis environment. Further topics about this method are discussed.

AB  - Although all university majors are prominent, and the necessity of their presence is of no question, they might not have the same priority basis considering different resources and strategies that could be spotted for a country. Their priorities likely change as the time goes by; that is, different majors are desirable at different time. If the government is informed of which majors could tackle today existing problems of world and its country, it surely more esteems those majors. This paper considers the problem of clustering and ranking university majors in Iran. To do so, a model is presented to clarify the procedure. Eight different criteria are determined, and 177 existing university majors are compared on these criteria. First, by k-means algorithm, university majors are clustered based on similarities and differences. Then, by AHP algorithm, we rank university majors.

AB  - In this paper, we consider discrete event logistics systems (DELS). DELS are networks of resources through which material flow. They have been the subject of a large body of analytic research. A huge variety of specific models exists that generally require application by model and/or solution experts to answer narrowly-defined logistics questions about inventory, sourcing, scheduling, routing, etc. It has, however, proven difficult to integrate these models in any comprehensive way into information systems for logistics because of the lack of conceptual alignment between the models produced by researchers and the information systems deployed in practice with which they should be integrated. In this paper, we systematically identify several challenges for DELS research. We analyse the root of the difficulties for applying academic research results in DELS, and indicate some potential future research directions.
