abstract = {The open nature of exploratory learning leads to situations when feedback is needed to address several conceptual difficulties. Not all, however, can be addressed at the same time, as this would lead to cognitive overload and confuse the learner rather than help him/her. To this end, we propose a personalised context-dependent feedback prioritisation mechanism based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Neural Networks (NN). AHP is used to define feedback prioritisation as a multi-criteria decision-making problem, while NN is used to model the relation between the criteria and the order in which the conceptual difficulties should be addressed. When used alone, AHP needs a large amount of data from experts to cover all possible combinations of the criteria, while the AHP-NN synergy leads to a general model that outputs results for any such combination. This work was developed and tested in an exploratory learning environment for mathematical generalisation called eXpresser.},

abstract = {Interpreting individuals described by a set of criteria can be a difficult task when the number of criteria is large. Such individuals can be ranked, for instance in terms of their average rank across criteria as well as by each distinct criterion. We therefore investigate criteria selection methods which aim to preserve the average rank of individuals but with fewer criteria. Our experiments show that these methods perform effectively, identifying and removing redundancies within the data, and that they are best incorporated into a multi-objective algorithm.},

abstract = {Enterprises nowadays are approaching towards an all IP paradigm by subscribing to different access technology links from several service providers for reliability and redundancy while providing good Quality of Service (QoS). Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) to Voice over IP (GSM-2-VoIP) convergence and vice-versa is a step forward towards this unification goal. It requires dynamic routing between IP, digital, analog and GSM networks. A decision-making framework is presented that can handle both the dynamic routing decision computation at private-public network border for inbound/outbound calls (GSM-2-VoIP) and the horizontal handover decision-making among various GSM cells. The decision engine takes multiple criteria into account while computing the routing and/or handover decisions (attributes from context of the request, platform's latest conditional parameters, business objectives of the company etc.) and/or (mobility management issues, user profile, traffic load etc.) respectively. An all open source real time platform consisting of Universal Serial Radio Peripheral (USRP), GNU Radio, an extended GSM stack (OpenBTS), OpenSIPS and Asterisk is developed to validate the proof of the concept. The system gives higher throughput and lower call dropping probability with an add-on susceptible delay offering good QoS and lower cost.},

This comparison is made using data extracted from logs of a local citizen information search engine, called iSAC. It is based on the learning and the inference of the assessment of a real user with regard to the documents provided by iSAC in response to his request. The experimental evaluations show that our algorithm provides results at least as good as those achieved with classical learning approaches, in addition to its capability to function in dynamic and time constrained environments.},

year = {2011},
publisher = {Winter Simulation Conference},
abstract = {As modern manufacturing technology progresses, measurement tools become scarce resources since more and longer control operations are required. It thus becomes critical to decide whether a lot should be measured or not in order to get as much information as possible on production tools or processes, and to avoid ineffective measurements. To minimize risks and optimize measurement capacity, a smart sampling algorithm has been proposed to efficiently select and schedule production lots on metrology tools. This algorithm and others have been embedded in a simulator called "Smart Sampling Scheduling and Skipping Simulator" (S5). The characteristics of the simulator will be presented. Simulations performed on several sets of instances from three different semiconductor manufacturing facilities (or fabs) will be presented and discussed. The results show that, by using smart sampling, it is possible to drastically improve various factory performance indicators when compared to current fab sampling.},

year = {2011},
publisher = {Winter Simulation Conference},
abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) simulation metamodeling using Bayesian networks (BNs). A BN is a probabilistic model that represents the joint probability distribution of a set of random variables and enables the efficient calculation of their marginal and conditional distributions. A BN metamodel gives a non-parametric description for the joint probability distribution of random variables representing simulation inputs and outputs by combining MIMO data provided by stochastic simulation with available background knowledge about the system under consideration. The BN metamodel allows various what-if analyses that are used for studying the marginal probability distributions of the outputs, the input uncertainty, the dependence between the inputs and the outputs, and the dependence between the outputs as well as for inverse reasoning. The construction and utilization of BN metamodels in simulation studies are illustrated with an example involving a queueing model.},

publisher = {Winter Simulation Conference},
abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to introduce a new framework to more efficiently investigate the patient flow of the Emergency Department (ED) of a governmental hospital in Tehran, Iran, in order to find out improving scenarios for reducing waiting times of patients. The proposed framework integrates the simulation model of patients flow process with the group AHP and TOPSIS decision models in order to evaluate and rank scenarios based upon desired performance measures. TOPSIS decision model takes the weights of performance measures from the group AHP and the values of performance measures from simulation model, and ranks the improving scenarios. The results analysis indicates that the average waiting time of non-fast-track patients by taking new policies with reasonable expenditure can be reduced by 42.3%.},

abstract = {Social psychology research deals with understanding many aspects of human behavior, and this helps not only to gain insights into this complex phenomenon but also to provide useful feedback to the participants. Social psychological research is mainly conducted through self-reports and surveys, however, this methodology is laborious and requires considerable offline analysis. Moreover, self-reports are also found to be biased towards pleasant experiences. Mobile phones represent a perfect platform for conducting social psychological research as they are ubiquitous, unobtrusive, and sensor-rich devices. However, limited battery and computing power, and expensive data plans make it difficult to support various demanding sensing and computation requirements of the social psychological research. In this paper, we describe the specific challenges in building systems based on off-the-shelf mobile phones for conducting social experiments, and provide design guidelines based on our recent works for implementing such systems.},

abstract = {Query processing in the uncertain database has become increasingly important due to the wide existence of uncertain data in many real applications. Different from handling precise data, the uncertain query processing needs to consider the data uncertainty and answer queries with confidence guarantees. In this paper, we formulate and tackle an important query, namely probabilistic inverse ranking (PIR) query, which retrieves possible ranks of a given query object in an uncertain database with confidence above a probability threshold. We present effective pruning methods to reduce the PIR search space, which can be seamlessly integrated into an efficient query procedure. Moreover, we tackle the problem of PIR query processing in high dimensional spaces, which reduces high dimensional uncertain data to a lower dimensional space. Furthermore, we study three interesting and useful aggregate PIR queries, that is, MAX, top-m, and AVG PIRs. Moreover, we also study an important query type, PIR with uncertain query object (namely UQ-PIR), and design specific rules to facilitate the pruning. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approaches over both real and synthetic data sets, under various experimental settings.},

abstract = {The interactions and social relations among users in workplaces have been studied by many generations of social psychologists. There is evidence that groups of users that interact more in workplaces are more productive. However, it is still hard for social scientists to capture fine-grained data about phenomena of this kind and to find the right means to facilitate interaction. It is also difficult for users to keep track of their level of sociability with colleagues. While mobile phones offer a fantastic platform for harvesting long term and fine grained data, they also pose challenges: battery power is limited and needs to be traded-off for sensor reading accuracy and data transmission, while energy costs in processing computationally intensive tasks are high.In this paper, we propose SociableSense, a smart phones based platform that captures user behavior in office environments, while providing the users with a quantitative measure of their sociability and that of colleagues. We tackle the technical challenges of building such a tool: the system provides an adaptive sampling mechanism as well as models to decide whether to perform computation of tasks, such as the execution of classification and inference algorithms, locally or remotely. We perform several micro-benchmark tests to fine-tune and evaluate the performance of these mechanisms and we show that the adaptive sampling and computation distribution schemes balance trade-offs among accuracy, energy, latency, and data traffic. Finally, by means of a social psychological study with ten participants for two working weeks, we demonstrate that SociableSense fosters interactions among the participants and helps in enhancing their sociability.},

year = {2011},
publisher = {Winter Simulation Conference},
abstract = {Due to their space limitation and small production scale, small and medium enterprises (SME) are vulnerable to rapid changes. Lean principles are considered as effective improvement approach to eliminate system's waste and inefficiencies. Although much of the academic materials have addressed the lean practices into large, global companies, they can still be adjusted to SMEs. Risks are usually associated with lean implementation process due to the drastic required changes in business policies and operations. Simulation can be successfully used to predict the impact of the proposed changes ahead of the implementation which helps to mitigate risks. Integrating simulation with optimization techniques provides optimum settings of the lean factors prior to the go live stage. In this study, simulation based optimization model was developed to optimize a set of parameters of lean SME against three performance measures -- cycle time, WIP (work in process) and workforce utilization. Results showed constructive insights.},
