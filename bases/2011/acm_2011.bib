abstract = {The open nature of exploratory learning leads to situations when feedback is needed to address several conceptual difficulties. Not all, however, can be addressed at the same time, as this would lead to cognitive overload and confuse the learner rather than help him/her. To this end, we propose a personalised context-dependent feedback prioritisation mechanism based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Neural Networks (NN). AHP is used to define feedback prioritisation as a multi-criteria decision-making problem, while NN is used to model the relation between the criteria and the order in which the conceptual difficulties should be addressed. When used alone, AHP needs a large amount of data from experts to cover all possible combinations of the criteria, while the AHP-NN synergy leads to a general model that outputs results for any such combination. This work was developed and tested in an exploratory learning environment for mathematical generalisation called eXpresser.},

abstract = {In a world of electronic calendars, the prospect of intelligent, personalized time management assistance seems a plausible and desirable application of AI. PTIME (Personalized Time Management) is a learning cognitive assistant agent that helps users handle email meeting requests, reserve venues, and schedule events. PTIME is designed to unobtrusively learn scheduling preferences, adapting to its user over time. The agent allows its user to flexibly express requirements for new meetings, as they would to an assistant. It interfaces with commercial enterprise calendaring platforms, and it operates seamlessly with users who do not have PTIME. This article overviews the system design and describes the models and technical advances required to satisfy the competing needs of preference modeling and elicitation, constraint reasoning, and machine learning. We further report on a multifaceted evaluation of the perceived usefulness of the system.},

abstract = {Many optimization problems are multiobjective in nature in the sense that multiple, conflicting criteria need to be optimized simultaneously. Due to the conflict between objectives, usually, no single optimal solution exists. Instead, the optimum corresponds to a set of so-called Pareto-optimal solutions for which no other solution has better function values in all objectives.Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO) algorithms are widely used in practice for solving multiobjective optimization problems due to several reasons. As randomized blackbox algorithms, EMO approaches allow to tackle problems with nonlinear, nondifferentiable, or noisy objective functions. As set-based algorithms, they allow to compute or approximate the full set of Pareto-optimal solutions in one algorithm run---opposed to classical solution-based techniques from the multicriteria decision making (MCDM) field. Using EMO approaches in practice has two other advantages: they allow to learn about a problem formulation, for example, by automatically revealing common design principles among (Pareto-optimal) solutions (innovization) and it has been shown that certain single-objective problems become easier to solve with randomized search heuristics if the problem is reformulated as a multiobjective one (multiobjectivization).This tutorial aims at giving a broad introduction to the EMO field and at presenting some of its recent research results in more detail. More specifically, I am going to (i) introduce the basic principles of EMO algorithms in comparison to classical solution-based approaches, (ii) show a few practical examples which motivate the use of EMO in terms of the mentioned innovization and multiobjectivization principles, and (iii) present a general overview of state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques. Moreover, I will present some of the most important research results in areas such as indicator-based EMO, preference articulation, and performance assessment.Though classified as advanced, this tutorial is intended for both novices and regular users of EMO. Those without any knowledge will learn about the foundations of multiobjective optimization and the basic working principles of state-of-the-art EMO algorithms. Open questions, presented throughout the tutorial, can serve for all participants as a starting point for future research and/or discussions during the conference.},

abstract = {Enterprises nowadays are approaching towards an all IP paradigm by subscribing to different access technology links from several service providers for reliability and redundancy while providing good Quality of Service (QoS). Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) to Voice over IP (GSM-2-VoIP) convergence and vice-versa is a step forward towards this unification goal. It requires dynamic routing between IP, digital, analog and GSM networks. A decision-making framework is presented that can handle both the dynamic routing decision computation at private-public network border for inbound/outbound calls (GSM-2-VoIP) and the horizontal handover decision-making among various GSM cells. The decision engine takes multiple criteria into account while computing the routing and/or handover decisions (attributes from context of the request, platform's latest conditional parameters, business objectives of the company etc.) and/or (mobility management issues, user profile, traffic load etc.) respectively. An all open source real time platform consisting of Universal Serial Radio Peripheral (USRP), GNU Radio, an extended GSM stack (OpenBTS), OpenSIPS and Asterisk is developed to validate the proof of the concept. The system gives higher throughput and lower call dropping probability with an add-on susceptible delay offering good QoS and lower cost.},

abstract = {The interactions and social relations among users in workplaces have been studied by many generations of social psychologists. There is evidence that groups of users that interact more in workplaces are more productive. However, it is still hard for social scientists to capture fine-grained data about phenomena of this kind and to find the right means to facilitate interaction. It is also difficult for users to keep track of their level of sociability with colleagues. While mobile phones offer a fantastic platform for harvesting long term and fine grained data, they also pose challenges: battery power is limited and needs to be traded-off for sensor reading accuracy and data transmission, while energy costs in processing computationally intensive tasks are high.In this paper, we propose SociableSense, a smart phones based platform that captures user behavior in office environments, while providing the users with a quantitative measure of their sociability and that of colleagues. We tackle the technical challenges of building such a tool: the system provides an adaptive sampling mechanism as well as models to decide whether to perform computation of tasks, such as the execution of classification and inference algorithms, locally or remotely. We perform several micro-benchmark tests to fine-tune and evaluate the performance of these mechanisms and we show that the adaptive sampling and computation distribution schemes balance trade-offs among accuracy, energy, latency, and data traffic. Finally, by means of a social psychological study with ten participants for two working weeks, we demonstrate that SociableSense fosters interactions among the participants and helps in enhancing their sociability.},
