AB  - Purpose
– With the rapid economic development of nations across the globe, there is proportionate increment in corresponding carbon footprint. There are numerous counter measures proposed to mitigate it in terms of legislation and policy framing. However, they have a shortsighted vision of predominantly focusing on manufacturing and transportation industry thereby neglecting one of the significant contributor of global emissions- agricultural industry. Among all the agri-food products, beef has the highest carbon footprint and majority of its emission are generated in beef farms. The issue is more intensive in developing nations where most of global cattle are raised and simultaneously farmers are less informed and aware of resources/technology to address emissions from their farms. Therefore, there is need to raise awareness among farmers and thereby incorporate carbon footprint as a major cattle supplier selection attribute by abattoir and processor and integrate it as a standard practice in procurement of cattle.
Design/methodology
A novel framework based on big data cloud computing technology is developed for eco-friendly cattle supplier selection. It is capable of measuring greenhouse gas emissions in farms and assimilate into the cattle supplier selection process. Fuzzy AHP, DEMATEL and TOPSIS method is employed to make an optimum tradeoff between conventional quality attributes and carbon footprint generated in farms to select the most appropriate supplier.
Findings
The proposed framework would assist in shedding the environmental burden of beef supply chain as the majority of carbon footprint is generated in beef farms. Moreover, the vertical coordination in the supply chain among farmers and abattoir, processor would be strengthened. The execution of the framework is depicted in case study section.
Originality
The literature is deficient of ecofriendly supplier selection in the agri-food sector particularly in developing countries. This study bridges the gap in the literature by proposing a novel framework to incorporate carbon footprint into traditional supplier selection process via an amalgamation of big data, ICT and Operations Research. The proposed framework would assist in mitigating the carbon footprint of beef products as they have highest emissions among all agri-food products. This framework is generic in nature and can be implemented in any food supply chain.

AB  - Depleting natural resources and limited amount of landfill areas have forced many governments to impose stricter measures on environmental performance. In order to comply with those measures and to have a better environmental image, companies are investing heavily in environmental, social and economic responsibility issues. Moreover, they continuously track the environmental performance of their suppliers. Many green supplier evaluation and ranking methodologies were proposed in the literature in order to assist companies in the environmental performance evaluation of suppliers. However, the number of studies on the sorting of suppliers based on environmental criteria is very limited. In this study, we fill this research gap by proposing a novel VIKOR-based green supplier sorting methodology called VIKORSORT. This methodology evaluates the environmental performance of suppliers and sorts them into the predefined ordered classes. The proposed methodology can easily be embedded into an expert system which can suggest a suitable green supplier development program for each class.

AB  - Dynamic optimization problems involving two or more conflicting objectives appear in many real-world scenarios, and more cases are expected to appear in the near future with the increasing interest in the analysis of streaming data sources in the context of Big Data applications. However, approaches combining dynamic multi-objective optimization with preference articulation are still scarce. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic multi-objective optimization algorithm called InDM2 that allows the preferences of the decision maker (DM) to be incorporated into the search process. When solving a dynamic multi-objective optimization problem with InDM2, the DM can not only express her/his preferences by means of one or more reference points (which define the desired region of interest), but these points can be also modified interactively. InDM2 is enhanced with methods to graphically display the different approximations of the region of interest obtained during the optimization process. In this way, the DM is able to inspect and change, in optimization time, the desired region of interest according to the information displayed. We describe the main features of InDM2 and detail how it is implemented. Its performance is illustrated using both synthetic and real-world dynamic multi-objective optimization problems.

KW  - Sequential approximate optimization
AB  - Weldlines are one of the major defects in plastic injection molding (PIM). Since the weldlines have an influence on not only the appearance of product but also the strength, it is important to reduce the weldlines as much as possible. The melt plastic will be quickly solidified with the low weldline temperature, which results in long weldlines. The weldline temperature is one of the important factors for the weldlines reduction. Clamping force also affect the product quality, but the relationship between the weldlines and the clamping force is rarely discussed in the literature. In this paper, the minimum weldline temperature is maximized for the weldlines reduction, whereas the clamping force is minimized for the high product quality. Therefore, a multi-objective design optimization is performed and the pareto-frontier between them is identified. Numerical simulation in PIM is generally so intensive that a sequential approximate optimization (SAO) using a radial basis function (RBF) network is used to identify the pareto-frontier. Through the numerical simulation, the trade-off between the minimum weldline temperature and the clamping force is clarified.

AB  - This paper presents the integration of a cognitive architecture with an intelligent decision support model (IDSM) that is embedded into an autonomous non-deterministic safety critical system. The IDSM will integrate multi-criteria decision making via intelligent technologies like expert systems, fuzzy logic, machine learning and genetic algorithms. Cognitive technology is currently simulated in safety–critical systems to highlight variables of interest, interface with intelligent technologies, and provide an environment that improves a system’s cognitive performance. In this study, the IDSM is being applied to an actual safety–critical system, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) software. The USV’s safety performance is being researched in a simulated and a real world nautical based environment. The objective is to build a dynamically changing model to evaluate a cognitive architecture’s ability to ensure safe performance of an intelligent safety–critical system. The IDSM does this by finding a set of key safety performance parameters that can be critiqued via safety measurements, mechanisms and methodologies. The uniqueness of this research will be on bounding the decision making associated with the cognitive architecture’s key safety parameters (KSP). Other real-time applications that could benefit from advancing the safety of cognitive technologies are unmanned platforms, transportation technologies, and service robotics. The results will provide cognitive science researchers a reference for safety engineering artificially intelligent safety–critical systems.

AB  - Decision support systems aim to help a decision maker with selecting the option from a set of available options that best meets her or his needs. In multi-criteria based decision support approaches, a suitability degree is computed for each option, reflecting how suitable that option is considering the preferences of the decision maker. Nowadays, it becomes more and more common that data of different quality, originating from different data sets and different data providers have to be integrated and processed in order to compute the suitability degrees. Also, data sets can be very large such that their data become commonly prone to incompleteness, imprecision and uncertainty. Hence, not all data used for decision making can be trusted to the same extent and consequently, neither the results of computations with such data can be trusted to the same extent. For this reason, data quality assessment becomes an important aspect of a decision making process. To correctly inform the users, it is essential to communicate not only the computed suitability degrees of the available options, but also the confidence about these suitability degrees as can be derived from data quality assessment. In this paper a novel multi-dimensional approach for data quality assessment in multi-criteria decision making, supporting the computation of associated confidence degrees, is presented. Providing confidence information adds an extra dimension to the decision making process and leads to more soundly decisions. The added value of the approach is illustrated with aspects of a geographic decision making process.

AB  - The assessment of biomass at high spatial resolution is critical to manage supply risks and to identify optimal plant sites for producing sustainable biofuels and co-products. The spatial variabilities in soil type, topography, climate, and crop management practices further require vast computational time and resources to estimate the availability of sustainable biomass for a large study area. In this study, we developed a GIS-based integrated predictive modeling platform to assess the availability of sustainable crop residues at high spatial (30 m) and temporal (2010–2022) scales. A GIS-based multi-criteria inclusion-exclusion analysis and facility location-allocation models were used to identify suitable sites, and optimal siting of biogas plants respectively with biomass delivered cost. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based predictive models were well suited to predict sustainability indicators (soil erosion SE- R2 = 0.96, soil conditioning index, SCI R2 = 0.98 and organic matter factor, OMF- R2 = 0.83) for assessing sustainable removal rates of crop residues (corn stover and wheat straw). The GIS-based integrated model was applied to the State of Ohio and found that about 4–13 dry Tg of crop residues can be sustainably available to build 1–25 regional biogas plants. A typical optimal biogas plant with a feedstock capacity of up to 500 dry Gg could be drawn from a transport radius of about 19–35 km with a delivered cost of 40–46 $ dry Mg−1. The temporal and spatial variations in assessing the availability of biomass largely affected the supply chain decisions and its delivered costs.

AB  - Community resilience to disaster is a concept that deals with different meanings depending on diverse disciplines and so far more attention has been given to its structural aspects. Only recently the social dimensions have sparked interests and its assessment is still a challenge dealing with the integration of quantitative variables and qualitative judgments. Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) can provide a consistent methodology to deal with this aspect, creating indeed, the background for ranking and evaluating the effect of potential decision and policy strategies aiming to enhance the social resilience. In this work, we proposed a study for defining social resilience through the application of the Promethee method. Five social macro-indicators, characterized by specific sub-indicators, were analyzed in ten Italian case study areas involved in the EU LIFE PRIMES Project. The information for the definition of the sub-indicators were carried out through the delivering of anonymous questionnaires to a sample of citizens in each interested area. The approach provided both a classification of communities in term of social resilience and the individuation of the most important indicators influencing the final ranking. This method can be suggested as an effective tool for studying the various dimensions characterizing social resilience.

Low investment costs, reducing greenhouse emission, and high output efficiency for good performance of power plants are key factors in evaluating energy parameters for governments. This study is intended on determining and proving the compatibility of existing power plants in the country of Iran by applying observational data through the application of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Analysis (MCDA). The obtained compromise solutions applied through a MATLAB code that helped in specifying which power plants are particularly suitable for establishment in the future work. Furthermore, it supports the generalization and validation of applying VIKOR method for thorough evaluation of power systems by comparing the results with real condition. The different types of power plants have been considered as alternatives. Multi-criteria evaluations of these diverse power plants were also carried out with respect to the environmental, technological, and economic criteria. It was concluded that hydropower plant is the best possible case for establishment, and the VIKOR method is a reliable technique for evaluating energy systems which can help to rank alternatives and determines the solution named compromise that is the closest to the ideal case.

AB  - Urban areas are facing a growing deployment of solar photovoltaic and thermal technologies on building envelopes, both on roofs and on façades. An effective solar energy planning process considers social acceptance, in relation to the landscape alteration induced by the solar modules. “Visual impact” is often considered as a major component of social acceptance but comprehensive visibility assessment models are lacking at the scale of the city. This paper presents a scale-dependent methodology to assess the visibility of building envelope surfaces exposed to solar radiation, which could host solar modules, in urban areas. A match between annual solar radiation, visibility and socio-cultural sensitivity of the built environment are proposed in a multi-criteria decision framework. Results are illustrated for the city of Geneva (Switzerland), as a case study: a partial overlap between highly sensitive urban areas and high visual interest is identified at the broad, strategic planning scale. In a second more detailed phase, a frequency breakdown of buildings is provided, according to the (non-) visible share of useful roof area for solar energy production. Less visible roofs are more likely to be situated in courtyards, far from the streets, in deep urban canyons or on low-pitched roofs. The outcomes indicate that stakeholders can reasonably expect to harvest a serious amount of solar energy by means of building integrated solar systems without crucially affecting public perception. In Geneva, more than 50 m2/building of non-visible roof surface receiving sufficient solar radiation for an economically viable solar refurbishment is available over half of the buildings. This method is valuable for large districts or cities (i) to spot more/less visible building sets and to estimate adapted precinct refurbishment strategies; (ii) to compare visibility on a common conventional basis and to detect zones deserving further investigations at the finer scale.

AB  - The building sector is one of the largest consumers of natural resources and energy in the world. Design strategies to improve the energy efficiency can decrease the negative impacts of a building. In order to evaluate and select the most appropriate design strategies for buildings, they should be analysed through a multidisciplinary approach based on sustainable development. The objective of this study is to propose a method that combines adaptive thermal comfort, climate change, life cycle assessment, life cycle cost analysis and multi-criteria decision making to help selecting the best design strategies to improve the sustainability of buildings. The method presented herein is based on a system of indicators that allows a comprehensive evaluation of design strategies. A multi-family social building, located in Milan, northern Italy, was used as a case study considering a 100-year lifespan. Six design strategies were evaluated. The EnergyPlus computer programme was used to estimate the annual energy demand for air-conditioning alone, with and without the design strategies. Three different databases were used to perform the life cycle analysis. For the life cycle cost analysis, the cost of each strategy was estimated based on the pricelist of the Milan Chamber of Commerce (Camera di Commercio di Milano). The results show that there will be an average increase of 53% in the cooling energy demand and a decrease of 49% in the heating energy demand in 2080 compared to the consumption in 2017. The design strategy with the highest level of sustainability was a reinforced concrete frame with rectified bricks, followed by a reinforced concrete frame with cellular concrete blocks and by cross-laminated timber (X-Lam) and wood fibre. This research highlighted the need for the use of a multi-criteria method to ensure the right selection of design strategies to obtain more sustainable buildings.

AB  - In plastic injection molding (PIM), the process parameters such as packing pressure, melt temperature, and cooling time should be adjusted and optimized for high product quality and high productivity. Warpage is one of the major defects in the PIM and should be minimized for high quality. Cycle time should be minimized for the high productivity. In addition to the warpage and the cycle time, clamping force affects the product both the quality and the productivity. Therefore, for the high product quality and the high productivity, it is important to minimize the warpage, the cycle time and the clamping force simultaneously. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization of process parameters in PIM for minimizing three objectives is performed. Numerical simulation in the PIM is generally so intensive that a sequential approximate optimization using radial basis function network is adopted to determine the optimal process parameters. The radar chart is used to perform the trade-off analysis among three objective functions. In addition, the better and worse solution are newly introduced for the trade-off analysis. It is found through the trade-off analysis that all objective functions of the conformal cooling channel are well improved in comparison with the ones of the conventional cooling channel. Therefore, 43% warpage reduction, 1,7% clamping force reduction, and 47% cycle time reduction can successfully be achieved using the conformal cooling channel. Based on the numerical result, the experiment using PIM machine (GL30-LP, Sodick) is carried out. The conformal cooling channel is developed by the metal 3D printer (OPM250L, Sodick). Through the numerical and experimental result, the validity of the proposed approach is examined.

AB  - Cloud computing has brought a paradigmatic shift in providing data storage as well as computing resources. With the ever-increasing demand for cloud computing, the number of cloud providers is also increasing evidently, which poses challenges as well as opportunities for consumers and providers. From a consumer point of view, efficient selection of cloud resources at a minimum cost is a big challenge. On the other hand, a provider has to meet consumers’ requirements with sufficient profit in the fiercely competitive market. The relationship between cloud computing is truly symbiotic in the sense that cloud computing makes the practice of analytics more pervasive while analytics makes cloud computing more efficient and optimal in a lot of ways. In addressing these issues, analytics plays an important role. In this paper, we reviewed some important research articles, which focus on cloud computing from the viewpoint of analytics. Analytics and cloud computing are found to be quite interdependent. From analytics perspective, cloud computing makes available high-end computing resources even to an individual customer at an affordable price. We call this thread “Analytics in Cloud”. From the point of view of cloud computing, efficient management, allocation, and demand prediction can be performed using analytics. We call this thread “Analytics for Cloud”. This review paper is mainly based on these two threads of thought process. In this regard, we reviewed eighty-eight research articles published during 2003–2017 related to the formidable duo of cloud computing and analytics.

AB  - Nowadays huge volumes of data are produced in the form of fast streams, which are further affected by non-stationary phenomena. The resulting lack of stationarity in the distribution of the produced data calls for efficient and scalable algorithms for online analysis capable of adapting to such changes (concept drift). The online learning field has lately turned its focus on this challenging scenario, by designing incremental learning algorithms that avoid becoming obsolete after a concept drift occurs. Despite the noted activity in the literature, a need for new efficient and scalable algorithms that adapt to the drift still prevails as a research topic deserving further effort. Surprisingly, Spiking Neural Networks, one of the major exponents of the third generation of artificial neural networks, have not been thoroughly studied as an online learning approach, even though they are naturally suited to easily and quickly adapting to changing environments. This work covers this research gap by adapting Spiking Neural Networks to meet the processing requirements that online learning scenarios impose. In particular the work focuses on limiting the size of the neuron repository and making the most of this limited size by resorting to data reduction techniques. Experiments with synthetic and real data sets are discussed, leading to the empirically validated assertion that, by virtue of a tailored exploitation of the neuron repository, Spiking Neural Networks adapt better to drifts, obtaining higher accuracy scores than naive versions of Spiking Neural Networks for online learning environments.

AB  - Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) represent a significant threat in deglaciating environments, necessitating the development of GLOF hazard and risk assessment procedures. Here, we outline a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach that can be used to rapidly identify potentially dangerous lakes in regions without existing tailored GLOF risk assessments, where a range of glacial lake types exist, and where field data are sparse or non-existent. Our MCDA model (1) is desk-based and uses freely and widely available data inputs and software, and (2) allows the relative risk posed by a range of glacial lake types to be assessed simultaneously within any region. A review of the factors that influence GLOF risk, combined with the strict rules of criteria selection inherent to MCDA, has allowed us to identify 13 exhaustive, non-redundant, and consistent risk criteria. We use our MCDA model to assess the risk of 16 extant glacial lakes and 6 lakes that have already generated GLOFs, and found that our results agree well with previous studies. For the first time in GLOF risk assessment, we employed sensitivity analyses to test the strength of our model results and assumptions, and to identify lakes that are sensitive to the criteria and risk thresholds used. A key benefit of the MCDA method is that sensitivity analyses are readily undertaken. Overall, these sensitivity analyses lend support to our model, although we suggest that further work is required to determine the relative importance of assessment criteria, and the thresholds that determine the level of risk for each criterion. As a case study, the tested method was then applied to 25 potentially dangerous lakes in the Bolivian Andes, where GLOF risk is poorly understood; 3 lakes are found to pose ‘medium’ or ‘high’ risk, and require further detailed investigation.

AB  - Trustworthiness is a comprehensive quality metric which is used to assess the quality of the services in service-oriented environments. However, trust prediction of cloud services based on the multi-faceted Quality of Service (QoS) attributes is a challenging task due to the complicated and non-linear relationships between the QoS values and the corresponding trust result. Recent research works reveal the significance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and its variants in providing a reasonable degree of success in trust prediction problems. However, the challenges with respect to weight assignment, training time and kernel functions make ANN and its variants under continuous advancements. Hence, this work presents a novel multi-level Hypergraph Coarsening based Robust Heteroscedastic Probabilistic Neural Network (HC-RHRPNN) to predict trustworthiness of cloud services to build high-quality service applications. HC-RHRPNN employs hypergraph coarsening to identify the informative samples, which were then used to train HRPNN to improve its prediction accuracy and minimize the runtime. The performance of HC-RHRPNN was evaluated using Quality of Web Service (QWS) dataset, a public QoS dataset in terms of classifier accuracy, precision, recall, and F-Score.

AB  - Decision support systems (DSS) are sophisticated tools that increasingly take advantage of big data and are used to design and implement individual- and organization-level strategic decisions. Yet, when organizations excessively rely on their potential the outcome may be decision-making failure, particularly when such tools are applied under high pressure and turbulent conditions. Partial understanding and unidimensional interpretation can prevent learning from failure. Building on a practice perspective, we study an iconic case of strategic failure in Formula 1 racing. Our approach, which integrates the decision maker as well as the organizational and material context, identifies three interrelated sources of strategic failure that are worth investigation for decision-makers using DSS and big data: (1) the situated nature and affordances of decision-making; (2) the distributed nature of cognition in decision-making; and (3) the performativity of the DSS. We outline specific research questions and their implications for firm performance and competitive advantage. Finally, we advance an agenda that can help close timely gaps in strategic IS research.

AB  - The unique ability of shape memory alloy or smart alloy to memorize its previous form has drawn notable attention recently in a wide range of commercial applications. In efforts to precisely predict and compare few significant WEDM machinability aspects like surface roughness [arithmetic mean roughness (Ra), root mean square roughness (Rq) and maximum peak-to-valley height (Rz)] and micro-hardness (MH) of shape memory alloy nitinol, general regression neural network (GRNN) model was developed. Five critical machining parameter, namely pulse-on time (TON), discharge current (I), wire feed (WF), wire tension (WT) and flushing pressure (FP) were taken as machining input for the experiments. The grid search method was employed to minimize cross-validation error. The developed GRNN model predicted the responses within ±10% error indicating GRNN as a competent strategy to predict WEDM responses. A multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach, Fuzzy logic coupled with multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (MOORA) is introduced to optimize different correlated responses. The parametric combination, TON = 12 µs, I = 10 A, WT = 12 N, WS = 150 mm/s. and FP = 8 Bar, were found to yield the preferred results. ANOVA test shows the efficiency of this hybrid MCDM model. Confirmation test has been done to validate the optimum process combination which demonstrates the improvement in WEDM responses. FESEM micrographs identifies lump of debris, micro cracks, pockmarks and recast layer in the machined surfaces.

AB  - Unplanned urbanization would pose serious threats to both environment and mankind. Hence, urban growth model (UGM) becomes mandatory to predict future growth of a city. In the current study, urban growth of Sriperumbudur Taluk, Tamil Nadu, India was predicted using three types of Cellular Automata (CA) model namely Traditional CA (TCA) model, Agents based Cellular Automata (ACA) Model and Neural Network coupled Agents- based Cellular Automata (NNACA) model. The urban maps of the study region for the years 2009, 2013 and 2016 along with the influencing agents of urbanization namely transportation, industries, elevation and also hotspot locations based on the Government policy were used in the modeling. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) technique was adopted to estimate the weights of the agents for suitability map preparation in ACA model. On validating 2016 predicted outputs, NNACA model proved to be the better urban model (kappa coefficient - 0.72) when compared to TCA and ACA models (kappa coefficient - 0.6 each). Shannon's entropy measure revealed that the urbanization is concentrated in the north-east direction and it is predicted to have an urban sprawl area of 157 km2 in 2020 using NNACA model while the observed urbanization is 113 km2 of the area in 2016.

AB  - A substantial effort has been made to solve the cloud-service evaluation problem. Different Cloud Service Evaluation Methods (CSEMs) have been developed to address the problem. Cloud services are evaluated against multiple criteria, which leads to a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problem. Yet, studies that assess, analyse, and summarize the unresolved problems and shortcomings of current CSEM-based MCDM are limited. In the existing review studies, only individual parts of CSEMs, rarely the full solution, are reviewed and examined. To investigate CSEMs comprehensively, we present a systematic literature review based on Evaluation Theory, a theory that generalizes six evaluation components, target, criteria, yardstick, data gathering techniques, synthesis techniques, and evaluation process. These six evaluation components and the CSEMs validation approach are the seven dimensions used to assess and analyse 77 papers published from 2006 to 2016. Sixteen research deficiencies were identified. The results confirm that the majority of the studies of the proposed CSEMs were either incomplete or lacked sufficient evidence. This research not only provides the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different CSEMs but also offers a basis for researchers and decision makers to develop improved CSEMs.

AB  - Ticks are economically and medically important ectoparasites due to the injuries inflicted through their bite, and their ability to transmit pathogens to humans, livestock, and wildlife. Whereas hard ticks have been intensively studied, little is known about soft ticks, even though they can also transmit pathogens, including African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) affecting domestic and wild suids or Borrelia bacteria causing tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) in humans. We thus developed a regional model to identify suitable spatial areas for a community of nine Ornithodoros tick species (O. erraticus, O. sonrai, O. alactagalis, O. nereensis, O. tholozani, O. papillipes, O. tartakovskyi, O. asperus, O. verrucosus), which may be of medical and veterinary importance in the Western Palearctic region. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis was used due to the relative scarcity of high-quality occurrence data. After an in-depth literature review on the ecological requirements of the selected tick community, five climate-related factors appeared critical for feeding activity and tick development: (i) a spring temperature exceeding 10°C to induce the end of winter soft tick quiescent period, (ii) a three-months summer temperature above 20°C to allow tick physiological activities, (iii) annual precipitation ranging from 60mm to 750mm and, in very arid areas, (iv) dry seasons interrupted by small rain showers to maintain minimum moisture inside their habitat along the year or (v) residual water provided by perennial rivers near habitats. We deliberately chose not to include biological factors such as host availability or vegetation patterns. A sensitivity analysis was done by performing multiple runs of the model altering the environmental variables, their suitability function, and their attributed weights. To validate the models, we used 355 occurrence data points, complemented by random points within sampled ecoregions. All models indicated suitable areas in the Mediterranean Basin and semi-desert areas in South-West and Central Asia. Most variability between models was observed along northern and southern edges of highly suitable areas. The predictions featured a relatively good accuracy with an average Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.779. These first models provide a useful tool for estimating the global distribution of Ornithodoros ticks and targeting their surveillance in the Western Palearctic region.

AB  - The design of funicular (or momentless) submerged arches has a great application in the fields of the building construction and the civil engineering. Traditional approaches in this field have been based on the resolution of ordinary differential equations that govern the structural behavior of the submerged arches. Indeed, these approaches only consider a design parameter and they are computationally expensive. For intermediate depth ratios, the funicular shape of the arch lays about halfway between the geometric forms of the parabola and the ellipse. Actually, the arch centerline could be modeled as a parametric linear function of these two conical shapes where different parameters are established, opening new opportunities for the optimization in the design of such structures, which also consider several design parameters. In this article, we propose a methodology to optimize several parameters in the design of submerged arches. Specifically, we focus on the reduction of the arch bending moment, which is a critical factor in the design cost of the structure, and also the maximization of the airspace enclosed by the arch, which is of particular interest in the serviceability of recreational submerged installations. Our methodology is based on a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, which uses artificial neural networks with extreme learning machine (ELM) to predict the level of bending stresses at the submerged arch under different shape configurations and also reduce the overall computational cost. Two groups of test examples, corresponding to deep and shallow waters, are developed to compare the numerical results obtained by multi-objective optimization with the theoretical curves predicted by the traditional funicular analysis. Our experimental results offer good accuracy (R2 up to 93%) in the fitness evaluation using ELM. After the multi-objective optimization procedure, our results show optimal arch-shapes with minimum bending stress (i.e., minimum cost) and maximum airspace; thus, the functionality of the underwater installation is also optimal.

AB  - To improve the ability and efficiency of the hospital management, it is needed for us to handle the decision making problems so as to assist the hospital decision support systems. Considering the complexity and urgency of the hospital management affairs, this paper proposes a projection model with hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets to solve the decision making problems under consideration. The proposed model not only can describe the uncertainties of the problems and the hesitancy of the decision makers, but also can decrease subjective and increase objectives of the decision making results. Then, the error analysis method is provided to obtain the weights of the criteria with hesitant fuzzy linguistic information. Furthermore, we make comparisons between the proposed model and other decision making methods, and present its advantages and drawbacks. Finally, a case study on hospital decision support systems is made to illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed model.

Along with the information science, in the field of decision science, multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approaches have been considerably applied in research studies. One of the most important procedures in supply chain management is selecting the optimal supplier to maintain the long-term productivity of the supply chain. There has been a vast amount of research which utilized MADM approaches to tackle the supplier selection problems, but only a few of these research considered big data structured problems. The current study presents a comprehensive novel approach for improving Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) based on cluster analysis considering crisp big data structure input which is called CLUS-MCDA (Cluster analysis for improving Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis) algorithm. The proposed method is based on consolidating a data mining technique i.e. k-means clustering method and a MADM approach which is MULTIMOORA method. CLUS-MCDA method is a fast and practical approach which has been developed in this research which is implied in a supplier selection problem considering crisp big data structured input. A real-world case study in MAMUT multi-national corporation has been presented to show the validity and practicality of the CLUS-MCDA approach which calculated considering the business areas and criteria based on expert comments of mentioned organizations and previous literature on supplier selection problem.

AB  - Route selection is the first and significant step for hazardous liquid railway network design project. Not only the economy, but the safety factors need to be considered for making a comprehensive analysis and determining an appropriate design plan. However, the railway network route selection is a complex multi-objective decision problem. Considering the construction cost and safety factors of hazardous liquid railway, this paper proposed a multi-objective optimization model. Considering the impact metrics, air pollution, river pollution, soil-underground water pollution, sensitive area and emergency system, a comprehensive risk assessment model was further built. The weight of each metric was decided by expert scoring. Based on index pricing method, risk factors were considered into maintenance and operation cost. Aiming at the strong non-linearity, a three-stage method was adopted to solve the problem. A virtual case and a real case with two refineries as sources and two terminals in midwestern China were studied in this paper. The construction schemes of hazardous liquid railway network in the study region were obtained by using the proposed method with considering the complex geographical and social environment. The effect of algorithm parameters on model was discussed in paper. Due to the high subjectivity of the emergency system score, the sensitivity of which was further analyzed. The practicality of the proposed method was verified through the case study.

AB  - With increasing growth of electricity consumption in developed and developing countries, the necessity of constructing and developing of power plants is inevitable. There are two main resources for electricity generation includes fossil and renewable energies which have some different characteristics such as manufacturing technology, environmental issues, accessibility and etc. In developing plans, it is important to consider and address the policy makers' indicators such as environmental, social, economic and technical criteria. In this paper, an integrated multi response Taguchi-neural network-fuzzy best-worst method (FBWM) -TOPSIS approach is applied to find an optimal level of five different power plants including: gas, steam, combined cycle, wind and hydroelectric. Taguchi method is used to design combinations and calculate some of the signal to noise (S/N) ratios. Then, neural network is applied to estimate the rest of S/N ratios. Finally, FBWM and TOPSIS methods are used for weighing sub-indicators and selecting the best combination, respectively. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach, a case study on the development of power plants in Iran is considered and the results are discussed. According to the results, in general, small size power plants for fossil resources are preferable. In contrast, medium and larger size power plants for renewable resources are preferable.

AB  - Early diagnosis is still the most important factor to deal with skin cancer, a disease that challenges physicians and researchers. It has benefited from computer-aided diagnosis methods that successfully combine dermoscopy, Digital Image Processing, and Machine Learning techniques. This paper aims to approximate medical professionals working with dermoscopy to these methods, to join the challenge of melanoma early detection. Accordingly, a proposal for extracting, selecting and combining texture and shape features from dermoscopic images is presented. The Feature Selection task is added to the learning process to potentiate the quality of classification models. Three classical Machine Learning algorithms were applied to differentiate melanoma from non-melanoma images. The models are evaluated by standard performance measures and a multi-criteria decision analysis method. This is the first time such method is used in melanoma diagnosis. As a result, we found a decision tree that performs well and allows the explicit representation and analysis of the knowledge learned from the images. In addition, the competitiveness of our decision models in comparison with literature approaches reviewed in this work encourages further applications of Machine Learning and Feature Selection to assist computer-aided diagnosis.

AB  - We develop a novel method that uses single-valued neutrosophic sets (NSs) to handle independent multi-source uncertainty measures affecting the reliability of experts’ assessments in group multi-criteria decision-making (GMCDM) problems. NSs are characterized by three independent membership magnitudes (falsity, truth and indeterminacy) and can be employed to model situations characterized by complex uncertainty. In the proposed approach, the neutrosophic indicators are defined to explicitly reflect DMs’ credibility (voting power), inconsistencies/errors inherent to the assessing process, and DMs’ confidence in their own evaluation abilities. In contrast with most of the existing studies, single-valued NSs are used not only to formalize the uncertainty affecting DMs’ priorities, but also to aggregate them into group estimates without the need to define neutrosophic decision matrices or aggregation operators. Group estimates are synthesized into crisp evaluations through a two-step deneutrosophication process that converts (1) single-valued NSs in fuzzy sets (FSs) using the standard Euclidean metric and (2) FSs in representative crisp values using defuzzification. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed to highlight the flexibility of the proposed approach. An illustrative example shows how taking into account the uncertainty inherent to the experts’ evaluations may deeply affect the results obtained in a standard fuzzy environment even when dealing with very simple ranking problems.

This study proposes a novel analytical framework, the “Importance-Performance-Impact Analysis” (IPIA), which aims to overcome several conceptual and methodological shortcomings associated with Importance–Performance Analysis (IPA). The IPIA framework integrates advanced analytical techniques, such as Back Propagation Neural Network and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL/ANP). We illustrate IPIA in one of the ‘Big Four’ airlines in China. IPIA Table and IPIA Matrix help transportation managers to allocate resources better than IPA to improve customer satisfaction.

AB  - Ready access to comprehensive influent information can help water reclamation plant (WRP) operators implement better real-time process controls, provide operational reliability and reduce energy consumption. The five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), a critical parameter for WRP process control, is expensive and difficult to measure using hard-sensors. An alternative approach based on a soft-sensor methodology shows promise, but can be problematic when used to predict high BOD5 values. Underestimating high BOD5 concentrations for process control could result in an insufficient amount of aeration, increasing the risk of an effluent violation. To address this issue, we tested a hierarchical hybrid soft-sensor approach involving multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), and compromise programming. While this hybrid approach results in a slight decrease in overall prediction accuracy relative to the approach based on ANN only, the underestimation percentage is substantially lower (37% vs. 61%) for predictions of carbonaceous BOD5 (CBOD5) concentrations higher than the long-term average value. The hybrid approach is also flexible and can be adjusted depending on the relative importance between energy savings and managing the risk of an effluent violation.

AB  - The development of computational tools in the process industry is essential to achieve sustainable production systems. In this work, we present a framework which incorporates sustainability principles applied to the design and optimization of chemical processes. The methodology incorporates life cycle assessment, surrogate modeling, objectivereduction techniques, multi-objective optimization, and the use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as multi-criteria decision analysis tool. In particular, the use of DEA facilitates the post-optimal analysis of the Pareto front by filtering the number of designs and ranking them without the need to define explicit weights. Additionally, DEA also provides improvement targets for those designs identified as suboptimal. This characteristic is particularly appealing as it can guide retrofit efforts towards the most effective actions when benchmark processes are compared against the best technologies available. The capabilities of the framework are demonstrated in a case study based on the production of methanol from CO2 and hydrogen.

AB  - The evaluation of the performance, service life and maintainability of the buildings’ envelope is crucial to the accomplishment of more sustainable solutions. For that purpose, reliable methodologies should be defined to predict the service life of the buildings over time and according to their characteristics. In the last decades, several service life prediction methods have been established. This study intends to compare different service life prediction models applied to renderings, based on a multi-criteria decision analysis, in which two main criteria are analyzed: i) decision criteria, evaluating the features of each of the models proposed; and ii) the main goals of the stakeholders when applying a specific model, weighting the decision criteria according to their preferences. The analysis proposed comprises: the designer's perspective, who develops the model; and the user's point of view, who wants to use the model. In this study, a weighting and a sensitivity analysis of the criteria adopted are also proposed, providing stakeholder with information to select the most suitable model for a given use (e.g. a stakeholder without programming experience will tend to give more importance to the criterion “difficulty in learning the model”; whilst insurance companies may find stochastic models more adequate as they include uncertainty and risk). The results obtained in this study reveal that: simpler methods can be highly accurate but are only capable of analyzing the degradation phenomena in one dimension (relating the degradation condition of the rendered façades with their age); more complex models, are more demanding and more accurate, allowing encompassing the relevant variables for the explanation of the degradation of rendered façades; and stochastic models lead to the most relevant results, providing the risk of failure of the renderings according to their age and characteristics.

AB  - Graphical information (visualized data, information, and knowledge generated from different investigations and experimentations) is a useful form of decision-relevant information in all fields of study. The usages of such information are expected to increase exponentially due to the advent of big data. Unfortunately, there are no formal methods available for directly computing the graphical information generated from big data while making a decision. This study fills this gap and presents a fuzzy logic based method, as well as a decision support tool, to perform multiple criteria decision making by directly computing the graphical information generated from big data. The effectiveness of the proposed method and tool is demonstrated by conducting a case study. Further study can be carried out to see the implication of this study in making formal decisions aided by the big data.

AB  - This paper aims to propose a framework for the definition of an inspection policy with three main elements: evaluation of failure modes (MF) of a system, selection of the criteria that best represent each dimension of failure modes and a process for determining inspection actions through a multi-criteria approach. The proposed modeling consists of determining the inspection interval for each mode of failure, considering that the MF has different consequences under different criteria. To meet this goal, first, the system and its respective failure modes are identified. Then, the consequences of the MF are classified according to a logical decision diagram that assists the decision-maker in identifying the criteria to be used in modeling, which may vary between cost, downtime, safety, environmental, quality and reputation, selecting among them the one (s) that best represent each mode of failure. Finally, the inspection intervals are determined for each MF using a multiple-criterion decision analysis (MCDA). By applying the framework proposed in a subsystem of a thermoelectric plant, it was possible to determine the inspection interval for each failure mode. Through the proposed model, it was possible to introduce a broad view of the decision problem and to focus attention on the failure modes that have the greatest impact.

AB  - Many organizations are currently seeking to contract services from cloud computing rather than owing the possessions to supply those services. Due to the fast expansion of cloud computing, many cloud services have been developed. Any organization that tries to achieve the best flexibility and quick response to market requests, they have the options to use cloud services. Due to the diversity of cloud service providers, it is a very significant defy for organizations to select the appropriate cloud services which can fulfill their requirements, as numerous criteria should be counted in the selection process of cloud services. Therefore, the selection process of cloud services can be considered as a type of multi-criteria decision analysis problems. In this research paper, we present how to aid a decision maker to estimate different cloud services by providing a neutrosophic multi-criteria decision analysis (NMCDA) approach for estimating the quality of cloud services. Triangular neutrosophic numbers are used to deal with ambiguous and incompatible information which exist usually in the performance estimation process. An efficacious model is evolved depending on neutrosophic analytic hierarchy process (NAHP). The aim is to solve the performance estimation problem and improve the quality of services by creating a strong competition between cloud providers. To demonstrate the pertinence of the proposed model for disbanding the multi-criteria decision analysis, a case study is presented.

AB  - With the advancement of computational modeling and simulation (M&S) methods as well as data collection technologies, urban dynamics modeling substantially improved over the last several decades. The complex urban dynamics processes are most effectively modeled not at the macro-scale, but following a bottom-up approach, by simulating the decisions of individual entities, or residents. Agent-based modeling (ABM) provides the key to a dynamic M&S framework that is able to integrate socioeconomic with environmental models, and to operate at both micro and macro geographical scales. In this study, a multi-agent system is proposed to simulate residential dynamics by considering spatiotemporal land use changes. In the proposed ABM, macro-scale land use change prediction is modeled by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and deployed as the agent environment and micro-scale residential dynamics behaviors autonomously implemented by household agents. These two levels of simulation interacted and jointly promoted urbanization process in an urban area of Tehran city in Iran. The model simulates the behavior of individual households in finding ideal locations to dwell. The household agents are divided into three main groups based on their income rank and they are further classified into different categories based on a number of attributes. These attributes determine the households’ preferences for finding new dwellings and change with time. The ABM environment is represented by a land-use map in which the properties of the land parcels change dynamically over the simulation time. The outputs of this model are a set of maps showing the pattern of different groups of households in the city. These patterns can be used by city planners to find optimum locations for building new residential units or adding new services to the city. The simulation results show that combining macro- and micro-level simulation can give full play to the potential of the ABM to understand the driving mechanism of urbanization and provide decision-making support for urban management.

AB  - Big Data is one of the recent technological advances with the strong applicability in almost every industry, including manufacturing. However, despite business opportunities offered by this technology, its adoption is still in early stage in many industries. Thus, this study aimed to identify and rank the significant factors influencing adoption of big data and in turn to predict the influence of big data adoption on manufacturing companies' performance using a hybrid approach of decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)- adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). This study identified the critical adoption factors from literature review and categorized them into technological, organizational and environmental dimensions. Data was collected from 234 industrial managers who were involved in the decision-making process regarding IT procurement in Malaysian manufacturing companies. Research results showed that technological factors (perceived benefits, complexity, technology resources, big data quality and integration) have the highest influence on the big data adoption and firms' performance. This study is one of the pioneers in using DEMATEL-ANFIS approach in the big data adoption context. In addition to the academic contribution, findings of this study can hopefully assist manufacturing industries, big data service providers, and governments to precisely focus on vital factors found in this study in order to improve firm performance by adopting big data.

In this context, this study aims at hybridizing fuzzy multi criteria decision making approaches for the development of an assessment framework that can be used to efficiently identify and rank notable software project risks will aid decision making during the lifecycle of a software product. Specifically, for the assessment of project risk, we have integrated fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory, Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making and TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive and Multiple Attribute Decision Making) approaches. The proposed methodology is used for providing an effective rating mechanism to measure software risk factors. The effectiveness of the proposed approach results have been compared with earlier methods for the assessment of software project risks. The comparison was done based on the OMRON data set of 40 software projects. Evaluation results reveal that the integration of fuzzy approaches could be effective and as well accurate compared to existing approaches for evaluating software project risks.

AB  - Supplying affordable, acceptable, and adequate sources of energy is one of the most important concerns of the communities. Due to the unbalanced distribution of fossil fuels, as well as their environmental effects, the utilization of renewable energies sources has been one of the main strategies. Due to the importance of transportation for societies, biofuels technologies is important part of researches, in particular algae. Algae are a type of single or multi-cellular organisms that are multiplying rapidly, and have photosynthesis-based growth and evolution. In this paper, after classifying and determining the main factors affecting the production of liquid fuels from microalgae, the feasibility and the best regions for production are discussed in the case study, Iran. The analysis method is multi criteria decision making in order to rank the best locations for microalgae growing. The results show that Iran has a high potential for microalgae utilization and the coastlines of Oman Sea and the Persian Gulf are the best regions for large-scale algae cultivation and processing projects.

The conventional business intelligence emphasizes descriptive and diagnostic analytics to achieve performance measurement and management. Furthermore, business analytics extends to include predictive and prescriptive analytics to generate responsive action plans. In the area of BI&A, the following issues are critical but difficult to tackle: (1) How to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) in a data-driven manner? (2) How to consider the interrelationships among the KPIs to develop a strategic map for an outcome? (3) How to incorporate the impacts of the leading indicators on a lagging outcome into performance forecasting? Inspired by the concept of statistical learning and machine learning, this research presents a novel framework consisting of random forest, Bayesian belief network, and time-series model. In particular, to justify the validity of the presented framework, three types of personal-computer (PC) firms including commercial PC, industrial PC and fabrication PC are respectively used to characterize various business models in computer industries: original brand manufacturing (OBM), original design manufacturing (ODM), and electronic manufacturing service (EMS).

AB  - Land resources in mountainous areas have become severely inadequate because of accelerated urbanization and industrialization, rational land exploitation in low-slope hilly areas can solve this issue. Under the protection of ecological security, this study applied a new method that combined generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and neighborhood selection algorithm (NSA) to evaluate the land suitability with a case study in Dali Prefecture, China. Land development potential was also measured and mapped according to the area proportion of land suitable to be exploited in each township. The results demonstrated that 2139 km2 and 871 km2 of low-slope hilly land were suitable for development of farmland and construction land, respectively. Of this resource, 1687 km2 and 419 km2 were identified as single-suitability area for farmland and construction land respectively, with 452 km2 of multi-suitability area. After trade-off analysis based on NSA, the final area suitable for development of farmland and construction land were 1909 km2 and 387 km2 respectively, with 4600 km2 restricted to development. The township development priority was determined according to the land development potential, which helped for local development planning. The methodology applied in this study provides an effective way to make decisions on land development and management in mountainous areas.

AB  - Analytical methods for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) support the non-monetary valuation of ecosystem services for environmental decision making. Many published case studies transform ecosystem service outcomes into a common metric and aggregate the outcomes to set land use planning and environmental management priorities. Analysts and their stakeholder constituents should be cautioned that results may be sensitive to the methods that are chosen to perform the analysis. In this article, we investigate four common additive aggregation methods: global and local multi-attribute scaling, the analytic hierarchy process, and compromise programming. Using a hypothetical example, we explain scaling and compensation assumptions that distinguish the methods. We perform a case study application of the four methods to re-analyze a data set that was recently published in Ecosystem Services and demonstrate how results are sensitive to the methods.

AB  - There is an increasing recognition in the public audit profession that the emergence of big data as well as the growing use of business analytics by audit clients has brought new opportunities and challenges. That is, should more complex business analytics beyond the customary analytical procedures be used in the engagement and if so, where? Which techniques appear to be most promising? This paper starts the process of addressing these questions by examining extant external audit research. 301 papers are identified that discuss some use of analytical procedures in the public audit engagement. These papers are then categorized by technique, engagement phase, and other attributes to facilitate understanding. This analysis of the literature is categorized into an External Audit Analytics (EAA) framework, the objective of which is to identify gaps, to provide motivation for new research, and to classify and outline the main topics addressed in this literature. Specifically, this synthesis organizes audit research, thereby offering guidelines regarding possible future research about approaches for more complex and data driven analytics in the engagement.

AB  - The concept of walkability refers to the extent to which a neighbourhood is walking-friendly. Several walkability indexes have been developed to quantify and evaluate the pedestrian environment. These indexes differ in terms of type of data, methods and goals. The indexes variables may present either uniform or distinct weights, defined by arbitrary, empirical or other diverse weighting methods. This paper pursues the determination of a weighted walkability index, constructed on the basis of the relative importance of their attributes. Weights were determined by the application of the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP), a robust multi-criteria method which considers the experts’ uncertainty in decision making. Moreover, FAHP weights were compared with the attribute weights obtained from other simpler methods, and a chi-square test for homogeneity was computed to compare the obtained values. The three most important walkability attributes were: Public Security, Traffic Safety and Pavement Quality, similar results to the ones found in the literature. The application to a case study in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, allowed categorizing the studied neighbourhoods and to analyse the effect of changes on attributes in walkability.

AB  - In the world of manufacturing, a manufacturing strategy must be selected depending on which strategy would produce the higher output rate, in order to carry out a set of product operations. This study focuses on the steady-demand domain, where two strategies are feasible; Classical Assembly Line and Seru, a recent Japanese strategy that mostly involves single-worker assembly lines. Mathematical modelling is used to determine the worker-to-station and task-to-station assignments of product structures with different parameters to calculate the assembly line output rate. On the other hand, simpler calculations are sufficient to determine the Seru strategy output rate. The aim is to study the relationship between worker skill level variation and strategy selection by building a neural network model using NeuroSolutions. Skill levels were considered to be normally distributed from 1 to 7. Inputs such as number of tasks, product precedence network flexibility, and task processing time variation will also be incorporated to support the learning process of the neural network model. The neural network model will then be applied to predict the more favourable strategy that would produce the higher output rate, between the Classical Assembly and Seru approach. As a result, this will help serve as a guideline regarding when to use Classical Assembly vs. Seru strategy, using only the available information about the product and skill variation and without the need to solve any mathematical model.

KW  - Validity
AB  - Rooted deeply in medical multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM), risk assessment is very important especially when applied to the risk of being affected by deadly diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD risk assessment is a stochastic, uncertain, and highly dynamic process influenced by various known and unknown variables. In recent years, there has been a great interest in fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), a popular methodology for dealing with uncertainty in MCDM. This paper proposes a new FAHP, bimodal fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (BFAHP) that augments two aspects of knowledge, probability and validity, to fuzzy numbers to better deal with uncertainty. In BFAHP, fuzzy validity is computed by aggregating the validities of relevant risk factors based on expert knowledge and collective intelligence. By considering both soft and statistical data, we compute the fuzzy probability of risk factors using the Bayesian formulation. In BFAHP approach, these fuzzy validities and fuzzy probabilities are used to construct a reciprocal comparison matrix. We then aggregate fuzzy probabilities and fuzzy validities in a pairwise manner for each risk factor and each alternative. BFAHP decides about being affected and not being affected by ranking of high and low risks. For evaluation, the proposed approach is applied to the risk of being affected by CHD using a real dataset of 152 patients of Iranian hospitals. Simulation results confirm that adding validity in a fuzzy manner can accrue more confidence of results and clinically useful especially in the face of incomplete information when compared with actual results. Applying the proposed BFAHP on CHD risk assessment of the dataset, it yields high accuracy rate above 85% for correct prediction. In addition, this paper recognizes that the risk factors of diastolic blood pressure in men and high-density lipoprotein in women are more important in CHD than other risk factors.

AB  - The effect of online reviews on resulting decisions attracted the interests of merchants and researchers in different fields. According to existing studies, the decisions of tourists are highly likely modified after browsing online reviews from other travelers on a tourism website. The manner in which online reviews on tourism websites are utilized to select hotels and support tourists is a noteworthy research problem. Online reviews of a hotel are provided by various tourists with respect to different criteria; thus, each tourist is regarded as a decision-maker. In this instance, the problem of hotel selection is based on online reviews in a tourism website and is expressed as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. In this study, a mathematical model was designed to select appropriate hotels on websites. First, a new comparison method for linguistic distribution assessments was proposed based on linguistic scale functions. Second, a novel distance measurement between linguistic distribution assessments with different numbers of linguistic terms was defined with an adjustable parameter. Third, a model for calculating weights and a mathematical model were constructed according to the idea of prioritized aggregation operator and distance measurement. Finally, a case study of TripAdvisor.com was conducted to select suitable hotels using online reviews of hotels. Data analysis was completed to prove the viability of the designed model.

AB  - In this paper, we do a critical review of statistical methods for landslide susceptibility modelling and associated terrain zonations. Landslide susceptibility is the likelihood of a landslide occurring in an area depending on local terrain conditions, estimating “where” landslides are likely to occur. Since the first attempts to assess landslide susceptibility in the mid-1970s, hundreds of papers have been published using a variety of approaches and methods in different geological and climatic settings. Here, we critically review the statistically-based landslide susceptibility assessment literature by systematically searching for and then compiling an extensive database of 565 peer-review articles from 1983 to 2016. For each article in the literature database, we noted 31 categories/sub-categories of information including study region/extent, landslide type/number, inventory type and period covered, statistical model used, including variable types, model fit/prediction performance evaluation method, and strategy used to assess the model uncertainty. We present graphical visualisations and discussions of commonalities and differences found as a function of region and time, revealing a significant heterogeneity of thematic data types and scales, modelling approaches, and model evaluation criteria. We found that the range of thematic data types used for susceptibility assessment has not changed significantly with time, and that for a number of studies the geomorphological significance of the thematic data used is poorly justified. We also found that the most common statistical methods for landslide susceptibility modelling include logistic regression, neural network analysis, data-overlay, index-based and weight of evidence analyses, with an increasing preference towards machine learning methods in the recent years. Although an increasing number of studies in recent years have assessed the model performance, in terms of model fit and prediction performance, only a handful of studies have evaluated the model uncertainty. Adopting a Susceptibility Quality Level index, we found that the quality of published models has improved over the years, but top-quality assessments remain rare. We identified a clear geographical bias in susceptibility study locations, with many studies in China, India, Italy and Turkey, and only a few in Africa, South America and Oceania. Based on previous literature reviews, the analysis of the information collected in the literature database, and our own experience on the subject, we provide recommendations for the preparation, evaluation, and use of landslide susceptibility models and associated terrain zonations.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) comprises of large number of devices which are heterogeneous in their hardware potentials and types of data traffic. In addition, IoT network is not having a common QoS (Quality of Service) goal but exhibits heterogeneous QoS demands which are dynamically driven by different IoT services such as smart city, e-health, e-business, smart parking etc. These heterogeneous services result in sporadic spectrum usage and make it difficult to achieve spectrum efficiency in IoT. It will also lead to spectrum scarcity for emergency IoT services. In this paper, Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach is proposed to coordinate IoT devices in spectrum sharing. This frame work evaluates and ranks the available spectrum bands based on their multiple spectral characteristics to match with the capacities and QoS needs of IoT devices. The complexity of the traditional multiple criteria ranking is reduced by one-fourth by introducing a Service-based Analytical Hierarchical Processing (S-AHP). Proposed framework is realized with Fog computing-MapReduce infrastructure to meet the latency constraints of IoT devices. Hadoop based simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves improved spectrum utilization and reduced service drops in comparison with other MCDM approaches such as Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) and Preference Selection Index (PSI).

AB  - The refugee crisis resulted in a large influx of refugees in the Mediterranean since 2014. However, crises are inherently complex phenomena, whereas the ultimate goal of all involved actors is to provide humanitarian aid to the affected populations. The required supply chain management and logistics operations are characterized by complex decision making whereas coordination between involved actors is necessary for effective aid delivery. Therefore, distributed problem solving based on autonomous and interacting agent can be used as a decision support tool in this field. The purpose of this paper is to address the solution of the refugee settlement site planning problem with an intelligent multi-agent system (MAS) modeling method. In particular, intelligent agents use two well-known multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM), Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Fuzzy axiomatic design approach with risk factors (RFAD), to rank alternative sites for refugee settlement siting. Up to authors’ knowledge, this study is the first that utilizes MAS and MCDM approaches in a decision support system for refugee settlement planning in literature. The proposed method has been applied to evaluate four currently operating refugee accommodation sites in Greece. Obtained results have confirmed and reflected the current situation in these camp locations.

AB  - In the present study, an optimal renewable energy management strategy (REMS) is proposed as a sustainable policy for non-fossil fuel-based centralistic energy policies. Accordingly, the demand load data and weather big datasets were analyzed using neural networks and analysis of variance, respectively. Biogas generation was modeled using a BSM2 dynamic model, and the available hydropower was evaluated in the form of a techno-economic assessment. A hybrid solar PV/wind turbine/biogas generator/hydroturbine/battery/inverter system was simulated as a gauge unit using the processed data to evaluate the potential of all renewable energies in Iran. The results were used to cluster Iran into various classes based on optimal green energy potential using a K-means algorithm. A factor analysis (FA) was performed using a big matrix consisting of 13 social, economic, environmental, and technical variables in all of Iran's provinces. Factor score coefficients were then employed in a mature multi-criteria decision making analysis technique to determine the order preference for an ideal solution (TOPSIS). These details were used to inform the REMS. The optimal hybrid renewable energy maps were generated and were combined with the FA-TOPSIS results to produce an action plan proposal. The results show that FA can explain 99% of the variance in the big data matrix. Iran can be efficiently clustered into five classes, while a four-stage action plan can assure sustainable development.

AB  - Semiconductor manufacturing is a capital-intensive industry that capital utilization rate significantly affect the capacity effectiveness and final profit. Capacity portfolio planning strategy must coordinate capacity expansion and migration decisions in balance for utility maximization for smart production and supply chain effectiveness. Manufacturers have to determine capital investments based on various demand forecasts of products in advance for long lead time in manufacturing process. Rapid development in semiconductor technology makes it difficult for companies to estimate future tool requirement especially for new-generation products planning decisions. This study aims to develop an uncertain multi-objective decision (UMD) strategy framework based on uncertainty theory for capacity expansion and migration problem. The objective of proposed model is to minimize the potential loss of capacity oversupply or shortage under uncertain environment. An empirical study was conducted for validation and the results showed practical viability of the proposed approach. The proposed model performs better than existing approach in minimizing the capacity cost loss of shortage, surplus, and migration. Therefore, the proposed approach can be employed as embedded decision support mechanism for smart production solutions for Industry 4.0.

AB  - Websites are one of the most widely distributed information resources. Educational institutions use this resource to ensure that the best quality of information transmission is achieved. As such, academic sites have become a very important aspect of academic institutions, one that affects their overall quality. Bearing in mind the importance of university websites’ quality, the authors of this paper presented a multi-criteria model for evaluating the quality of university websites. This paper presents the hybrid IR-AHP-MABAC (Interval Rough Analytic Hierarchy Process - MultiAttributive Border Approximation Area Comparison) model. The model is adapted to group decision making as based on the application of a new approach to treating uncertainties through the use of interval rough numbers (IRN). The modified IR-AHP method was used to determine the weight coefficients of the criteria in the group decision-making process. The results of the IR-AHP model are compared with results provided by the traditional AHP method and the fuzzy AHP approach. The IR-MABAC model was used for the evaluation of university websites. In order to verify the results of the IRN based approach, the IR-MABAC model was compared to the F-TOPSIS (Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), F-VIKOR (Fuzzy MultiCriterion Optimization and Compromise Solution), F-COPRAS (Fuzzy COmpressed PRoportional ASsessment), F-MAIRCA (Fuzzy MultiAtributive Ideal-Real Comparative Analysis), and F-TODIM (an acronym of Interactive and Multi Criteria Decision Making in Portuguese) models. The credibility of the IR-AHP-MABAC model was demonstrated by comparing the results of different multi-criteria techniques and analyzing viability. The results of the IRN approach and fuzzy comparison have shown that the new approach to dealing with imprecision yields credible, reputable ranks.

A cylindrical copper (99.9% pure) rod of 20 mm diameter has been selected as the electrode or tool material for machining. Four significant process parameters of EDM process such as discharge current (Ip), spark on time (Ton), duty cycle (Tau) and discharge voltage (V) have been studied in this research investigation. The effects of these parameters have been considered on the responses of EDM process such as Material Removal Rate (MRR) and Electrode Wear Rate (EWR) both in qualitative and quantitative terms. For qualitative analysis, main effect plots have been drawn, while for quantitative analysis ANOVA has been carried out. The significance of process parameters at 95% confidence interval has been found out through F-distribution and t-distribution values. ANOVA results revealed Ip and Ton as to be the major contributing process parameters for the considered EDM responses. Ip was found to have an 87.90% contribution towards MRR whereas Ton was having a 50.91% contribution towards TWR. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been implemented to find out the best trade-off between the responses MRR and EWR. The best process parameter setting for multi-criteria decision making among the answers such as MRR and EWR was found to be: Ip= 16A, Ton=500µs, Tau= 80%, V= 40volts.

AB  - In HVAC system design for passenger rail vehicles minimization of objectives on merchantability (initial costs), integration (equipment mass, volume), and operation (electric power demand, noise emissions) becomes increasingly important. Identification of appropriate process and component design parameters is a significant engineering challenge, particularly for emerging R744 (CO2) refrigerant cycles. In this work the sizes of the compressor, evaporator, gas cooler, cooler fan, and internal heat exchanger, plus the high pressure level and the cooler air flow rate of an R744 cycle were subject to multi-objective genetic optimization. Computationally inexpensive artificial neural networks were used as interface between different computation tools. As a result a set of Pareto-optimal R744 cycles was obtained to support the design engineer. For minimum volume and mass (153 l, 169 kg), total electric power demand was 9.2 kW. Vice-versa, minimum power demand (6.9 kW) yielded a large (272 l), heavy (198 kg), and expensive system.

AB  - The design of buildings, civil infrastructure and other complex systems in our built environment involves considering many, often conflicting, design criteria. Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) project teams often use multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods to help them arrive at a preferred design solution. An emergent MCDM method in practice today is Choosing by Advantages (CBA) which has been successfully applied to many AEC projects. This method has several benefits over traditional MCDM methods (such as the weighted sum): CBA does not allow to hide a compensation of money for value, CBA helps differentiate between alternatives based on the decision context, CBA reduces time to reach consensus, and it manages better subjective trade-offs by basing decisions on importance of agreed advantages. CBA is usually applied between two to ten alternatives, and it has never been used for more than one hundred alternatives. Hence, this study contributes to knowledge by developing and testing a new method for applying CBA to hundreds or thousands of alternatives. The new method involves clustering alternatives into a few representative design alternatives based on feature similarity using the K-means method. Preferences between these representative design alternatives are then generalized using linear regression. An experiment involving student subjects was conducted to measure the level of accuracy in which preferences can be generalized by the proposed method. The experiment considered 1,000 different building design alternatives. CBA was applied on representative alternatives using three, six, eight, and ten clusters. The study measured errors, correlations, and consistency of the predictions for each cluster configuration. When eight clusters were used for creating representative alternatives, decisions were always consistent to those made with random alternatives, and correlation with the predicted preference was higher with lower error compared to other cluster configurations tested.

AB  - The world population is estimated to reach nine billion by 2050. Many challenges are adding pressure on the current agriculture supply chains that include shrinking land sizes, ever increasing demand for natural resources and environmental issues. The agriculture systems need a major transformation from the traditional practices to precision agriculture or smart farming practices to overcome these challenges. Geographic information system (GIS) is one such technology that pushes the current methods to precision agriculture. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of 120 research papers on various applications of big GIS analytics (BGA) in agriculture. The selected papers are classified into two broad categories; the level of analytics and GIS applications in agriculture. The GIS applications viz., land suitability, site search and selection, resource allocation, impact assessment, land allocation, and knowledge-based systems are considered in this study. The outcome of this study is a proposed BGA framework for agriculture supply chain. This framework identifies big data analytics to play a significant role in improving the quality of GIS application in agriculture and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of big GIS data for improved agricultural productivity.

AB  - Nanotechnology research momentum suggests that informatics approaches are tractable in the era of big data. However, there is still much to convey to researchers interested in harnessing the power of big data and informatics for promoting sustainable nanotechnology. This review focuses on efforts that automate metric calculations, the analysis of synthesis data, and informatics approaches to the assessment of nanomaterials. Perspective on current interlinked informatics and decision making systems is not covered but state of the field of mixed life cycle risk assessment is presented. Therefore, readers are presented with linkages that frame green nanomaterial synthesis in the context of holistic sustainability assessment. Beneficial outcomes of applying informatics approaches include more timely design or safety evaluation, insight to bridge chemistry-engineering scale-up and process optimization. In addition to the need for more data and data sharing, there is a need for deeper case studies and cross comparison of design approaches.

AB  - Best Worst Method (BWM) has recently been proposed as a method for Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). Studies show that BWM compared with other methods such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), leads to lower inconsistency of the results while reducing the number of required pairwise comparisons. MCDM methods such as BWM require accurate information. However, it often happens in practice that a level of uncertainty accompanies the information. The main aim of this paper is to address this problem and provide an integration of BWM and Z-numbers, namely ZBWM. Providing BWM with Z-numbers enables the BWM method to handle the uncertainty of information of a multi-criteria decision. Additionally, the capabilities of the proposed method in the process of utilizing the linguistic information dealing with big data are highlighted. The proposed method is examined to address a supplier development problem. By experimental results, we show that ZBWM results lower inconsistency when compared with BWM. A Z-number contains subjectivity in its fuzzy part, which can be addressed in future applications of ZBWM.

AB  - Soil remediation has been considered as one of the most difficult pollution treatment tasks due to its high complexity in contaminants, geological conditions, usage, urgency, etc. The diversity in remediation technologies further makes quick selection of suitable remediation schemes much tougher even the site investigation has been done. Herein, a sustainable decision support hierarchical model has been developed to select, evaluate and determine preferred soil remediation schemes comprehensively based on modified analytic hierarchy process (MAHP). This MAHP method combines competence model and the Grubbs criteria with the conventional AHP. It not only considers the competence differences among experts in group decision, but also adjusts the big deviation caused by different experts’ preference through sample analysis. This conversion allows the final remediation decision more reasonable. In this model, different evaluation criteria, including economic effect, environmental effect and technological effect, are employed to evaluate the integrated performance of remediation schemes followed by a strict computation using above MAHP. To confirm the feasibility of this developed model, it has been tested by a benzene workshop contaminated site in Beijing coking plant. Beyond soil remediation, this MAHP model would also be applied in other fields referring to multi-criteria group decision making.

AB  - Classification procedure is an important task of expert and intelligent systems. Developing new algorithms of classification which improve accuracy or true positive rates could have an influence on some life problems such as diagnosis prediction in medical domain. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are expected to search the best alternative according to some criteria. Each criterion has a value relative to each alternative. There are only two sets: a set of criteria and a set of alternatives. This work merges MCDM methods TOPSIS and VIKOR and modifies them to be used for classification where the used sets are three: the classes, the objects and the attributes (features) describing the objects. Hence, ATOVIC, a new classification algorithm is proposed. In ATOVIC, criteria are replaced by features and alternatives are replaced by objects. The latter belong to corresponding classes. Two sets are employed one serves as reference and second serves as test. An object from test set will be classified to the relative class based on the reference set. ATOVIC is applied on a benchmark (UCI) CLEVELAND data set to predict heart disease. Following the complexity of the data set and its importance, ATOVIC application is done on different test sets of CLEVELAND using binary classification and multi-classification. Moreover, ATOVIC is applied to thyroid data set to detect hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism diseases. The obtained results show the efficiency of ATOVIC in medical domain. In addition, ATOVIC is applied to three other data sets: chess, nursery and titanic, from UCI and KEEL websites. The obtained results are compared to those of some classifiers from literature. The experimental results demonstrate that ATOVIC method improves accuracy and true positive rates comparing to most classifiers considered from literature. Hence ATOVIC is promising for use in prediction or classification.

AB  - Bio inspired algorithms are machine learning algorithms which are modelled around observed natural phenomenon. Bio inspired algorithms in recent years have been shown to perform data mining tasks with ease by many research studies conducted for very complex domain of NP Hard problems. Ant Colony Optimizationis a bio inspired algorithmwhich addresses such complex problems which requires meta-heuristics based approaches to find solutions. Itis modelled to mimic movement of ants in search for food and is influenced by nature inspired computing paradigms. Computationally, Ant Colony Optimizationexplores and exploits solution space to find fairly accurate solutions in less time. Classification is a data mining function which assigns input values to two or more designated classesof output, with the goal of accurately predicting target class for new input data. Discriminant analysis which falls under the broad gambit of classification data mining, is the statistical mapping of data values to one of the two predefined groups. In this study, the application of Ant Colony Optimizationto perform discriminant analysis has been explored. Predictive classification accuracy ofeighty-six percent has been achieved on an ordinal data set for the combination of one thousand ants and twenty-five instances (minimum) covered by one rule. Comparative analysis of the quality of outcome based on factors like pheromone levels, number of ants and number of minimum instances covered by a rule has been modelled.

AB  - The need for appropriate decisions to tackle complex problems increases every day. Selecting destinations for vacation, comparing and optimizing resources to create valuable products, or purchasing a suitable car are just a few examples of puzzling situations in which there is no standard form to find an appropriate solution. Such scenarios become arduous when the number of possibilities, restrictions, and factors affecting the decision rise, thereby turning decision makers into almost mere spectators. In such circumstances, decision support systems (DSS) can play an important role in guiding people and organizations towards more accurate decision making. However, conventional DSS lack the necessary adaptability to account for dynamic changes and are frequently inadequate to tackle the subjectivity inherent in decision-maker's preferences and intention. We argue that these shortcomings can be addressed by a suitable combination of Semiotic Theory and Computational Intelligence algorithms, which together can make up a new generation of DSS. In this article, a formal description of an Intelligent Semiotic Machine is provided and tried out in practical decision contexts. The results obtained show that our approach can provide well-suited decisions based on user preferences, achieving appropriateness while fanning out subjective options without losing decision context, objectivity, or accuracy.

AB  - Controlled shot peening process is performed on two independent ways: (1) Pre-shot peening of Almen strips to determine the desired intensity (2) Shot peening of the real sample with the Almen intensity obtained. Shot peening of Almen strips in the first step takes more time. This is because, the application of input parameters, also measuring arc height and controlling the Almen intensity stages have to be completed consecutively. The results influence the real sample characteristics directly. Still, the arc height measurements and the input parameters adjustment depend on technicians’ expertness. So, numerical approaches by conducting finite element modelling (FEM), ANN (artificial neural network) and RSM (response surface methodology) takes more attention growingly. For this purpose, another numerical approach, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods have been developed and verified among their counterparts and also by comparing the experimental results, surface roughness and surface hardness in this study. The results show that the MCDM methods are consistent within themselves and in the context of input parameters (air pressure, shot size, peening duration) and output parameters (surface hardness, surface roughness). The Topsis approach presents consistent results with compared to both the other approaches and the experimental conditions.

AB  - A Dynamic Manufacturing Network (DMN) is the manufacturing industry application of the Virtual Enterprise (VE) business model based on real time information sharing and process integration. DMNs are normally formed and supported by a collaborative platform previously designed and built by a preexisting strategic partnership. The collaborative platform forms and tracks each DMN through all phases of its life cycle which leads to the accumulation and storage of large historical datasets on partner and customer characteristics and actions. This data holds the key to customer and manufacturer behavioral patterns and performances that can further be used in the decision making processes. In this study, we have focused on tackling this widely neglected research opportunity, by integrating manufacturer, order and customer data and characteristics into DMN formation and planning. The developed big data analytics approach consists of TOPSIS, fuzzy inference system and multi objective optimization techniques. Initially, by integrating the TOPSIS multi criteria decision making technique with a fuzzy inference system (FIS) we have computed indices for Manufacturer reliability and Order priority. Then we developed a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to generate efficient solutions minimizing cost and assigning more reliable manufacturers to orders with higher priority.

AB  - Aiming to develop a theoretically consistent framework to estimate travel demand using multiple data sources, this paper first proposes a multi-layered Hierarchical Flow Network (HFN) representation to structurally model different levels of travel demand variables including trip generation, origin/destination matrices, path/link flows, and individual behavior parameters. Different data channels from household travel surveys, smartphone type devices, global position systems, and sensors can be mapped to different layers of the proposed network structure. We introduce Big data-driven Transportation Computational Graph (BTCG), alternatively Beijing Transportation Computational Graph, as the underlying mathematical modeling tool to perform automatic differentiation on layers of composition functions. A feedforward passing on the HFN sequentially implements 3 steps of the traditional 4-step process: trip generation, spatial distribution estimation, and path flow-based traffic assignment, respectively. BTCG can aggregate different layers of partial first-order gradients and use the back-propagation of “loss errors” to update estimated demand variables. A comparative analysis indicates that theproposed methods can effectively integrate different data sources and offer a consistent representation of demand. The proposed methodology is also evaluated under a demonstration network in a Beijing subnetwork.

AB  - This research presents an application of an artificial neural network inverse (ANNi) and genetic algorithm (GA) to propose and solve a multivariable function in order to optimize of an absorption heat transformer (AHT) with energy recycling. The purpose of the research is to provide a method capable of maximizing the coefficient of performance (COP) of the AHT, by finding multiple optimal input variables, with the benefit of minimizing energy in the heat supply of the equipment. AHT use waste heat sources to obtain useful energy, but by recycling part of the useful energy within the same system provides an increase in performance. Therefore, the research is focused on optimizing the heat source in the generator, evaporator and additionally the condenser simultaneously, since the value of the COP is determined through the ratio of the useful heat load between the loads of heat supplied. Consequently, this study is based on modeling the process and then performing the optimization, using the following research methods: artificial neural networks (ANN), ANNi and GA. An ANN model was developed to predict the value of COP, based on experimental data from the equipment. A satisfactory agreement was obtained by comparing the simulated and experimental data. With the ANN model consolidated, an ANNi was applied where the variables to be optimized were: temperature in the generator, temperature in the evaporator and temperature in the condenser. GA was chosen to solve the multivariable function. The results showed that when applying the ANNi-GA methodology, it is possible to carry out the multivariable optimization, since this methodology had only been used to optimize one variable at a time. The temperature in the generator turned out to be the key variable to increase the performance of AHT, followed by the evaporator and condenser, managing to maximize the COP value of a specific test from 0.26 to 0.43 and obtain an energy saving of up to 3 °C with a maximum computation time of 5.38 s. With the results obtained, the research effect provides a feasible method to control multiple input variables of an AHT, from a desired COP value. By properly supplying the waste heat to the AHT, it is possible to minimize the energy consumption and experimentation time, since the proposed method determines the best scenario to obtain good results, instead of performing different experimental tests. Finally the GA solved satisfactorily the ANNi multivariable function proposed, making feasible the use of this tool to optimize different variables at the same time.

This paper proposed a Preeminet Service Ranking (PSR) method using backward propagation neural network (BPNN) to find the best services. The method consists of two phases which are the Training phase and the Ranking phase. In the Training phase, the network is trained and obtain the deviation. It means that error of the current network from the ideal network. In the Ranking phase, determine the best services are at any given time using the deviation obtained from the training phase. The mobile cloud services are measured by using Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. This paper proved that a proposed method performs better over conventional methods like TOPSIS, AHP, and ANP.

AB  - Background
Proper Health-Care Waste Management (HCWM) and integrated documentation in this sector of hospitals require analyzing massive data collected by hospital’s health experts. This study presented a quantitative software-based index to assess the HCWM process performance by integrating ontology-based Multi-Criteria Group Decision-Making techniques and fuzzy modeling that were coupled with data mining. This framework represented the Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Corporate Performance Management (CPM) types of Process Mining in which a user-friendly software namely Group Fuzzy Decision-Making (GFDM) was employed for index calculation.
Findings
Assessing the governmental hospitals of Shiraz, Iran in 2016 showed that the proposed index was able to determine the waste management condition and clarify the blind spots of HCWM in the hospitals. The index values under 50 were found in some of the hospitals showing poor process performance that should be at the priority of optimization and improvement.
Conclusion
The proposed framework has distinctive features such as modeling the uncertainties (risks) in hospitals’ process assessment and flexibility enabling users to define the intended criteria, stakeholders, and number of hospitals. Having computer-aided approach for decision process also accelerates the index calculation as well as its accuracy which would contribute to more willingness of hospitals’ experts and other end-users to use the index in practice. The methodology could efficiently be employed as a tool for managing hospitals’ event logs and digital documentation in big data environment not only for the health-care waste management, but also in other administrative wards of hospitals.

AB  - Digital technology and social media have brought numerous benefits to human society. TripAdvisor, which runs on user-generated content, provides a platform for travelers to socialize their opinions on several aspects of hotels. Recommendation agents have played an important role for hotel recommendations in the tourism domain. They are valuable tools in e-tourism platforms of travel agencies to help the users in their decision-making process. The recommendation of hotels by multi-criteria Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender systems is mainly based on their past reviews on several aspects. Hence, recommending the most appropriate hotel to the user is one of the important tasks that a multi-criteria CF needs to do in the e-tourism platform. The aim of this research is to use the multi-criteria ratings in developing a new recommendation method for hotel recommendations in e-tourism platforms. We use supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to analysis the customers’ online reviews. The method is evaluated on the data provided by the travelers via TripAdvisor mobile application. The results of our analysis on the dataset confirm that the use of online reviews in the proposed recommendation agent leads to precise recommendations in TripAdvisor.

AB  - This paper aims to provide a useful and practical methodology for bus transit operators to monitor and improve the quality of bus transit services. To this aim, a two-stage multi-criteria decision making approach is proposed. The first stage involves the use of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine the priority of each service quality attribute from the passengers’ point of view. The second stage adopts Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to measure the service quality and rank the bus transit routes. The proposed approach provides a comprehensive performance analysis by incorporating user preferences and multiple criteria into the evaluation. Analysis identifies the most important service quality attributes from the users’ perspectives. Furthermore, it distinguishes between high and low quality transit routes and gives an opportunity to monitor and improve the quality of bus transit service.

The framework is flexible as it allows customization or tailoring and meeting various SI constructs and dimensions. Triangular fuzzy numbers have been used to express linguistic values of experts’ subjective preferences. Measurement of SI is performed by using fuzzy numbers for finding criteria weights and ranking the potential candidates by SI construct. An illustrative example has also been demonstrated to show the applicability and usage of the proposed framework.

AB  - This paper presents two methods which aim at improving the efficiency of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and metamodel-assisted EAs (MAEAs) used to solve multi-objective optimization problems with computationally expensive evaluation tools. The EAs and MAEAs are accelerated by implementing the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) during: (a) the application of the evolution operators, by processing the population members in a new/feature, rather than the standard design, space and/or (b) the metamodel training, to reduce the number of input units and, thus, get more accurate predictions. Over and above, a variant of EA (or MAEA) which takes the decision maker's (DM) preferences into consideration during the evolution is proposed. In contrast to standard multi-objective EAs which may insufficiently populate the preferred area(s) of the objective space, more non-dominated solutions are now driven towards them. This is achieved by using the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), which affects the parent selection and the non-dominated front trimming operators. The combined use of KPCA and TOPSIS is implemented, too. The proposed methods are evaluated by solving two computationally demanding aerodynamic shape optimization problems, with two objectives each.

AB  - Most of the traditional pattern classifiers assume their input data to be well-behaved in terms of similar underlying class distributions, balanced size of classes, the presence of a full set of observed features in all data instances, etc. Practical datasets, however, show up with various forms of irregularities that are, very often, sufficient to confuse a classifier, thus degrading its ability to learn from the data. In this article, we provide a bird’s eye view of such data irregularities, beginning with a taxonomy and characterization of various distribution-based and feature-based irregularities. Subsequently, we discuss the notable and recent approaches that have been taken to make the existing stand-alone as well as ensemble classifiers robust against such irregularities. We also discuss the interrelation and co-occurrences of the data irregularities including class imbalance, small disjuncts, class skew, missing features, and absent (non-existing or undefined) features. Finally, we uncover a number of interesting future research avenues that are equally contextual with respect to the regular as well as deep machine learning paradigms.

AB  - Titanium alloys are familiar for their capability to withstand extreme environmental conditions. However, high fabrication and machinability cost of titanium limits their applications to defense and aerospace sectors. In order to enhance their domestic applicability, either their fabrication or machining costs have to be controlled. With an intention to reduce machinability cost; tool wear and surface roughness of Ti6Al4V titanium alloy are predicted through different computational techniques like Neural Network and fuzzy logics in this investigation. A full factorial design set of experiments are conducted on CNC turning machine to envisage the clout of input parameters like cutting speed, cutting feed, cutting time. The output responses emphasized are the tool wear of carbide tool inserts with coated TiN layer and surface roughness of Titanium Alloy. Neural network and fuzzy logic models are generated by training on this data to prediction output responses. The models are further validated by addition 8 different experimental data sets. This revealed the superiority of ANFIS over neural network with good prediction accuracy.

AB  - Existing Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) based communication suffers from various security and performance issues, hence Cluster based Communication is preferred nowadays. However, Cluster based Communication adds extra overhead and burden on the Cluster Head (CH) in dense network scenarios which eventually introduces delay and hinders network performance. To reduce the overburdening of single CH, a multi cluster head scheme is proposed in which multiple nodes in a cluster can act as CH to share the load of single CH. For a selection of stable CH, Hybrid Fuzzy Multi-criteria Decision making approach (HF-MCDM) is proposed in which Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and TOPSIS methods are clubbed together for optimal decision making. Further because of association of Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) with life-critical applications, there is a dire need for a security framework to detect various malevolent attacks. Machine Learning based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) like Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the approaches for curbing such attacks. These intrusion detection based mechanism can be combined with various existing optimization techniques to improve their performance, and Dolphin Swarm Algorithm is one such approach. Dolphins have many significant biological features like echolocation, exchange of information, coordination, and division of labor. These biological features combined with swarm intelligence can be utilized for optimizing the detection and accuracy of SVM based IDS. So in this paper, a Multi-Cluster Head anomaly based IDS optimized by Dolphin Swarm Algorithm has been proposed and its results are compared with various existing Security frameworks in terms of parameters like false positive, detection rate, detection time, etc. and it is observed that the proposed approach performs better.

Several aspects of Industry 4.0 have been studied in the literature. However, studies on the challenges for implementing Industry 4.0 in manufacturing operations have received less attention. To address this gap, this study identifies a set of challenges (framework) for implementing Industry 4.0 in manufacturing industries. This framework is evaluated in the leather industry of Bangladesh aided by a novel multi-criteria decision-making method named Best-Worst method (BWM). The findings of the study showed that ‘lack of technological infrastructure’ is the most pressing challenge that may hurdle the implementation of Industry 4.0 whereas ‘environmental side-effects’ is the less among the challenges that may hinder implementation of Industry 4.0 in the Bangladeshi leather industry. This result may help decision makers, industrial managers and practitioners in the Bangladeshi leather industry to realize the actual challenges confronting them when attempting to implement Industry 4.0 and focus their attention on how to address these challenges to pave ways for a successful implementation of Industry 4.0.

As cell identification is a critical step towards the development of Shoreline Management Plan (SMP), this paper provides the needed evidence to justify its rationality using Longhai city as a testing site. The coastal zone boundary of Longhai city was firstly defined taking into consideration the interface between land and sea. Seven cell units were identified with due consideration of existing plans. Subsequently, Multi-criteria Decision Making analysis coupled with GIS techniques was performed to verify the rationality of the cell identification. The results justified and supported the cell identification approach and outcomes with respect to dominant sectors within each unit, as well as the integrative and adaptive characteristics of the SMP in balancing environmental conservation and socioeconomic development. The quantitative approach further enables evaluating its adaptability in a changing environment.

AB  - In addition to prototyping, Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) AM processes have lately been more widely used to manufacture end-use parts. These changes lead to necessity of higher requirements to quality of a final product. Optimization of process parameters is one of the ways to achieve desired quality of a part. Finite Element Method (FEM) and machine learning techniques are applied to evaluate and optimize AM process parameters. While FEM requires specific information, Machine Learning is based on big amounts of data. This paper provides a conceptual framework on combination of mathematical modelling and Machine Learning to avoid these issues.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is proving to be an efficient alternative approach to classical modeling techniques. AI refers to the branch of computer science that develops machines and software with human-like intelligence. Compared to traditional methods, AI offers advantages to deal with problems associated with uncertainties and is an effective aid to solve such complex problems. In addition, AI-based solutions are good alternatives to determine engineering design parameters when testing is not possible, thus resulting in significant savings in terms of human time and effort spent in experiments. AI is also able to make the process of decision making faster, decrease error rates, and increase computational efficiency. Among the different AI techniques, machine learning (ML), pattern recognition (PR), and deep learning (DL) have recently acquired considerable attention and are establishing themselves as a new class of intelligent methods for use in structural engineering. The objective of this review paper is to summarize techniques concerning applications of the noted AI methods in structural engineering developed over the last decade. First, a general introduction to AI is presented and the importance of AI in structural engineering is described. Thereafter, a review of recent applications of ML, PR, and DL in the field is provided, and the capability of such methods to address the restrictions of conventional models are discussed. Further, the advantages of employing such algorithmic methods are discussed in detail. Finally, potential research avenues and emerging trends for employing ML, PR, and DL are presented, and their limitations are discussed.

AB  - Sustainable development is being approached as new economic paradigm that establishes a general context for organizations and institutions develop their strategies and processes. This is particularly true for public administration, where a change process is being taking place towards the development of sustainable and smart cities. Complex operations networks and closed-loop supply chains define structures for managing the flow of materials, energy and information. This paper addresses the problem of managing solid waste in small cities, and based on an in depth case study that is used to illustrate the application of a performance measurement assessment exercise. The development of the assessment model is based on an adaptation of the methodology for Multi-criteria Decision Aid – Constructivist (MCDA-C), that allows the comparison of the proposed strategic objectives for solid waste management and the available performance information. Experts play an important role in aligning objectives with the performance measurement system, as the performance indicators could be objectively defined, and integrated to the assessment model, which produces at the end a global score that could be used for benchmarking, particularly for tracking the evolution over the years. The model is applied in the context of a small city that formally addresses sustainability in its institutional strategic plan. The model is tailor-made for the application case, and it is verified that the sustainability index for assessing the solid waste management obtained a score of 30.5 points, considering as reference the anchorage of intervals with performance "Neutral" 0 (zero) points and "Good” 100 (one hundred) points. It is identified objective opportunities for improvement in areas associated to governance and operational efficiency. It could be concluded that the performance assessment of the municipal solid waste management becomes an important element to ensure compliance, and to realize the sustainability strategy plan. Besides that, it provides information to control and an integrated management of the key performance dimensions, mainly due to the identification of factors that connect measures to diagnosis and improvement processes. Based on a case study, a performance assessment could take place and shows its value to the practice of municipal solid waste management.

AB  - Laminated composite panels are presently being used in wider applications in automotive, aerospace, defence and civil type of industries. It has various advantages over conventional materials with superior specific stiffness & strength, fatigue and corrosion resistance with energy absorption feature comparing others. Optimal design of composite laminates regarding change in ply angles to increase the strength is obligatory to realize the complete potentiality of fibre reinforced particles/materials. The above epistemology is applied to the multi-objective design optimization technique of fibre-reinforced solid rocket motor composite cylindrical skirt of space vehicle is analyzed. In that solid rocket motor, a skirt is defined as a feasible component for weight diminution which leads to reduction of entire weight. Due to its significance, it is recommended to optimize the both weight and expense of the fibre reinforced composite (FRC) cylindrical shape skirt affected to overstressing strength and buckling strength at the combined conditions of aerodynamic torque and thrust in axial direction. In this paper, the failure principle of Tsai-wu is applied to determine the first ply catastrophe. Failure strength and Buckling strength of the skirt is depicts by using overstressing load level factor and buckling load factor. Various material combinations such as Graphite/Epoxy & Glass/Epoxy, have been used to find the optimal values. Laminated composite skirts are fabricated with glass-epoxy if cost is the criteria and graphite-epoxy if weight comes into an account

AB  - This article presents a methodology for the construction and use of metamodels with Deep Learning (DL) methods that are useful for making multi-criteria decisions in the design and optimization of one-way slabs. The main motivation behind this research has been to examine the possibilities of improving slab design by including this methodology in future tools, which is capable of calculating thousands of solutions in real time based on the designer’s specifications. The process of creating these metamodels begins by developing a database of millions of combinations of slab designs. These combinations are calculated with a heuristic algorithm that provides the following results: rigidity, deflection, cost per square meter, CO2 emissions and embodied energy. Once a database including the entire universe of possible solutions has been created, a metamodel is developed that is capable of “condensing” the implicit knowledge contained in the database. This metamodel is included within a Decision Support System (DSS) that produces thousands of solutions for slabs that all comply with a range of specifications designated by the design plan. Furthermore, the methodology described herein proposes the use of Pareto-optimal solutions and graphic tools to help designers make multi-criteria decisions regarding the solutions that best fit their needs. A case study is presented to illustrate this proposal: optimizing slab design in two buildings according to technical, economic and sustainability criteria. The results indicate that the multi-criteria solutions obtained would entail a significant reduction in both emissions and embodied energy as compared to mono-criteria solutions, without significantly increasing costs.

AB  - Blockchain acts on a big data analytics because transaction data belongs to streaming data and high-dimensional data from distributed computing network. Accordingly, such operation produces irrelevant data problem and further poorly optimized traceability in blockchain. So, we claim that the artificial intelligence of blockchain mining algorithm like traceability chain algorithm runs faster than consensus algorithm because of inference mechanism. Our main goal is to reach traceability decision not consensus decision as fast as possible. Thus, this article proposes a novelty approach called Takagi–Sugeno Fuzzy cognitive maps ANN as traceability chain algorithm. The numerical example of the proposed algorithm in blockchain mining is evaluated and optimized decisions experiment is analyzed. Objective functions for optimized decision computation is described as participant nodes constraint method. Thus contribution succeeds in meeting the reduction mining efforts for the traceability chain being processed. Our findings also provide a preliminary indication of deep learning applied big blockchain transactions data.

KW  - Uncertainty
AB  - Several approaches within the exploratory modelling literature—each with strengths and limitations—have been introduced to address the complexity and uncertainty of decision problems. Recent model-based approaches for decision making emphasise the advantage of mixing approaches from different areas in leveraging the strengths of each. This article shows how a multi-method lens to the design of decision-making approaches can better address different characteristics of multi-objective decision problems under deep uncertainty. The article focuses on interactions between two broad areas in model-based decision making: exploratory modelling and multi-objective optimisation. The article reviews this literature using a specific multi-method lens to analyse previous researches and to identify the knowledge gap. The article then addresses this gap by demonstrating a multi-method approach for designing adaptive robust solutions. The suggested approach uses a Pareto optimal search from multi-objective optimisation for enumerating alternative solutions. It also uses Robust Decision Making and Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approaches from exploratory modelling for analysing the robustness of enumerated solutions in the face of many future scenarios. A hypothetical case study is used to illustrate how the approach can be applied. The article concludes that a new lens from a multi-method design perspective is needed on exploratory modelling to provide practical guidance into how to combine exploratory modelling techniques, to shed light on exiting knowledge gaps and to open up a range of potential combinations of exiting approaches for leveraging the strengths of each.

KW  - Multi-criteria relational clustering (MCRC)
AB  - The modeling and solving of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems under uncertainty is still a challenging topic. In real-life decision-making, using linguistic terms to represent experts’ judgments is suitable and straightforward since precise quantitative values may often be unavailable or the cost for their computation is too high. The introduction of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) was motivated by the limitations of prior linguistic fuzzy models and need for richer linguistic tools. However, since their introduction, comparing HFLTSs is still one of the major concerns of researchers in this area. The existing approaches in the literature commonly rely on (1) labels and intervals from the linguistic terms as the central elements of an envelope-based approach or (2) linguistic scale functions as the basis of a distance-based approach. The two approaches retain certain shortcomings resulting information distortion and loss which may inevitably degrade their credibility. In this paper, the authors are involved in the recent proposal of combining outranking approaches with HFLTSs in an MCDM context. After reviewing the existing approaches, an outranking method based on a novel knowledge-based paradigm for comparing HFLTSs is developed. Alternatively, the paradigm's foundations are the introduced concepts of fuzzy preference relations and profiles considering uncertainty degrees in decision makers’ assessments. The paradigm is then associated with a multi-criteria relational clustering (MCRC) algorithm that additionally extracts fuzzy preference relations between the resultant clusters. Last, an illustrative example is given to verify the appropriateness and efficacy of the developed approach and comparisons are made with other existing ones.

AB  - The success of requirement prioritization process largely depends upon how well different constraints and influential factors are handled by stakeholders and developers while prioritization. The main goal of this research is to present a semi-automated dependency based collaborative requirement prioritization approach (CDBR), which uses linguistic values, execute-before-after (EBA) relation among requirements and machine learning algorithm to minimize the difference of opinion between stakeholder and developers for effective collaboration and for better approximation of final prioritization results, acceptable to both. The presented approach targets three major constraints rarely addressed in existing work, namely dependencies among requirements, communication among stakeholder and developers and the issue of scalability. Results of performance assessment conducted on several different requirement sets and on a case study by comparing CDBR with other state of the art approaches namely, AHP and IGA. The results are accurate and comparable in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, scalability and disagreement concerns among stakeholder and developers which in turn provides robustness to decision making process of awarding more importance to some requirements over others. CDBR overpowers AHP and IGA in terms of efficiency and processing time respectively.

AB  - Manufacturing, through the Industry 4.0 concept, is moving to the next phase; that of digitalization. Industry 4.0 enables the transition of traditional manufacturing systems to modern digitalized ones, generating significant economic opportunities by reshaping of industry. This procedure requires high-performance processes and flexible production systems. The adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) in manufacturing will enable effective and adaptive planning and control of production systems. Towards that end, the proposed work presents a cloud-based cyber-physical system for adaptive shop-floor scheduling and condition-based maintenance. The proposed system demonstrated that it is possible to deploy a cost-effective and reliable real-time data collection, processing, and analysis from the shop floor. It also demonstrates that such collected data can be used in an adaptive decision making system, which includes a multi-criteria decision-making algorithm and a condition-based maintenance strategy aiming to improve factory performances when compared to traditional approaches. The proposed system consists of different modules (monitoring, adaptive scheduling, condition-based maintenance) interconnected through the cloud-based platform, enabled by communication protocols under the Industry 4.0 and IoT paradigms. The proposed system is applied and validated in a real-case study from a high-precision mold-making industry.

AB  - This paper presents a review on the application of neural networks for the estimation, forecasting, monitoring, and classification of exogenous environmental variables that affect the performance, salubrity, and security of cities, buildings, and infrastructures. The forecast of these variables allows to explore renewable energy and water resources, to prevent potentially hazardous construction locations, and to find the healthiest places, thus promoting a more sustainable future. Five research themes are covered—solar, atmospheric, hydrologic, geologic, and climate change. The solar section comprises solar radiation, direct and diffuse radiation, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, clearness index, and sky luminance and luminous efficacy. The atmospheric section reviews wind, temperature, humidity, cloud classification, and storm prediction. The hydrologic section focuses on precipitation, rainfall-runoff, hail, snow, drought, flood, tides, water levels, and other variables. The geologic section covers works on landslides, earthquakes, liquefaction, erosion, soil classification, soil mechanics, and other properties. Finally, climate change forecasting and downscaling of climate models are reviewed. This work demonstrates the wide range of applications of these methods in different research fields. Some research gaps and interdisciplinary research opportunities are identified for future development of comprehensive forecast and evaluation approaches regarding the estimation of renewable energy and built environment-related variables.

AB  - The large number of environmental problems faced by society in recent years has driven researchers to collect and study massive amounts of data in order to understand the complex relations that exist between people and the environment in which we live. Such datasets are often high dimensional and heterogeneous in nature, with complex geospatial relations. Analysing such data can be challenging, especially when there is a need to maintain spatial awareness as the non-spatial attributes are studied. Geo-Coordinated Parallel Coordinates (GCPC) is a geovisual analytics approach designed to support exploration and analysis within complex geospatial environmental data. Parallel coordinates are tightly coupled with a geospatial representation and an investigative scatterplot, all of which can be used to show, reorganize, filter, and highlight the high dimensional, heterogeneous, and geospatial aspects of the data. Two sets of field trials were conducted with expert data analysts to validate the real-world benefits of the approach for studying environmental data. The results of these evaluations were positive, providing real-world evidence and new insights regarding the value of using GCPC to explore among environmental datasets when there is a need to remain aware of the geospatial aspects of the data as the non-spatial elements are studied.

AB  - Artisanal and small-scale mining is one of the global phenomena that is a threat to environmental health and safety. There are ambiguities in the manner in which an ore-processing facility operates. These ambiguities can cause environmental problems and hinder the mining capacity of these miners in Ghana. The vast majority of attempts to address these problems through the establishments of centralised processing centres have failed, with only a handful of successes. This research sought to use an established data-driven, geographic information based system to locate a centralised gold processing facility within the Wassa Amenfi-Prestea Mining Area in the Western region of Ghana. The study was designed to first determine the relevant factors that should be considered in the decision-making process for locating a centralised ore-processing facility. Secondly, it sought to implement the identified factors in a case study by identifying specific geospatial techniques that can best be applied to identify potential sites. By adopting in-depth consultations with four stakeholder groups for data collection and content analysis for data analysis, thirteen relevant factors were identified. However, in the case study, due to data unavailability, only seven of the factors were considered. Geoprocessing techniques including buffering and overlay analysis and multi-criteria decision analysis were employed to develop a model to identify the most preferred locations to site a centralised processing facility. Site characterisations and environmental considerations, incorporating identified constraints, to determine an appropriate location were selected. The final map output indicates estimated potential sites identified for the establishment of a centralised processing centre. The results obtained provide areas suitable for consideration.

AB  - Energy has been the major input for the national economies. While fossil-based energy resources are diminishing, researchers are focusing on alternative fuels and various technology options for conversion, distribution, and end user's operating environment processes. As the search for the alternative pathways for the “sustainable economy” idea continues, management factor is getting considerably important within each phase of energy generation and consumption. In this paper, we employ a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making methodology to evaluate the energy management performance of selected nine countries with a focus on Turkey with respect to a number of criteria. The hybrid approach integrates three methods, viz. Analytical Hierarchy Process, Multi-Criteria Optimization and Compromise Solution, and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. It enables decision-makers assess multiple alternatives within an analytic framework while considering multiple criteria simultaneously. We perform our analysis for each year between 2001 and 2016. The results show that, with its fast-growing population, dynamic economy, and huge energy saving potential, Turkey displays a low profile compared to the other countries in our scope. Our results can be encompassed by in-depth analyses and long-term plans to shift the country's energy technology selection strategies to more efficient, cost-effective and cleaner options.

AB  - Because of the possible harmful effects of construction equipment on the environment, evaluation of them can be considered as a helpful activity to move toward the sustainability in construction. This evaluation process could involve some alternatives and some criteria in a discrete decision space. In this study, a new hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed to deal with this evaluation process in the fuzzy environment. We present fuzzy extensions of the SWARA (Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) and CRITIC (CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation) methods for determining subjective and objective weights of criteria. Based on these extended methods and the fuzzy EDAS (Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution) method, a new hybrid approach is proposed. In this approach, the subjective and objective criteria weights are combined to determine more justified weights for criteria. The proposed approach is applied to a case study of construction equipment evaluation with sustainability considerations. To examine the result of evaluation, a sensitivity analysis is performed based on varying criteria weights. A comparison is also made between the results of the proposed approach and some existing MCDM methods. These analyses show the stability and validity of the results and efficiency of the proposed approach.

AB  - In the US, the demand for outpatient services is expected to increase, while the supply of physicians to provide the care is projected to decrease. Besides, inefficiencies in the appointment system (AS) and patient no-shows (patients who do not arrive for scheduled appointments) reduce provider productivity, timely access to care, and cost the U.S. healthcare system more than $150 billion a year. To handle increasing demand and compensate for patient no-shows, outpatient clinics tend to overbook appointments. The current scheduling practice at most clinics and majority of the scheduling rules proposed in the literature assume all patients are equally likely to miss an appointment. Further, most scheduling rules in the literature do not make use of the available data, such as electronic health records, when scheduling patients. This paper proposes a prescriptive analytics framework to improve the performance of an AS with respect to patient satisfaction (measured using average patient waiting time and number of patients unable to get an appointment for the day under consideration) and resource utilization (measured using average resource idle time, overflow time and overtime). In the proposed framework, patient-related data from various sources are used to develop predictive models that identify the risk of a patient no-show. Different scheduling rules, that leverage the patient-specific no-show risk is then proposed. A case study, with real data from a Family Medicine Clinic in Pennsylvania, is used to show the feasibility of the proposed framework. The effectiveness of the proposed scheduling rules is evaluated by benchmarking it with three rules adapted from the literature. The results indicate that the proposed scheduling rules consistently outperform the benchmark rules for all the clinic settings tested. Further, the proposed framework is generic and can be adopted by any outpatient clinic characterized by occurrences of no-shows and appointment-based customer arrivals.
