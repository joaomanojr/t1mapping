N2  - Abstract The rapid growth of new computing paradigms such as Cloud Computing and Big Data has unleashed great opportunities for companies to shift their business model towards a fully digital strategy. A major obstacle in this matter is the requirement of highly specialized ICT infrastructures that are expensive and difficult to manage. It is at this point that the IaaS (infrastructure as a service) model offers an efficient and cost-affordable solution to supply companies with their required computing resources. In the Big Data context, it is often a hard task to design an optimal IaaS solution that meets user requirements. In this context, we propose a methodology to optimize the definition of IaaS cloud models for hosting Big Data platforms, following a threefold criterion: cost, reliability, and computing capacity. Specifically, the proposed methodology hinges on evolutionary heuristics in order to find IaaS configurations in the cloud that optimally balance such objectives. We also define measures to quantify the aforementioned metrics over a Big Data platform hosted within an IaaS cloud model. The proposed method is validated by using real information from three IaaS providers and three Big Data platforms. The obtained results provide an insightful input for system managers when initially designing cloud infrastructures for Big Data applications.

N2  - Abstract The objective of this manuscript is to present some aggregation operators for aggregating the different complex intuitionistic fuzzy (CIF) sets by considering the dependency between the pairs of its membership degrees. In the existing studies of fuzzy and its extensions, the uncertainties present in the data are handled with the help of degrees of membership that are the subset of real numbers, which may lose some useful information and hence consequently affect the decision results. A modification to these, complex intuitionistic fuzzy set handles the uncertainties with the degrees whose ranges are extended from real subset to the complex subset with unit disc and hence handle the two-dimensional information in a single set. Thus, motivated by this, we developed some new power aggregation operators, namely, CIF power averaging, CIF weighted power averaging, CIF ordered weighted power averaging, CIF power geometric, CIF weighted power geometric, and CIF ordered weighted power geometric. Also, some of the desirable properties of these are investigated. Further, based on these operators, a multicriteria decision-making approach is presented under the CIF set environment. An illustrative example related to the selection of the best alternative(s) is considered to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach and is validated it by comparing their results with the several existing approaches results.

N2  - Abstract System obsolescence issues are a routine occurrence, especially for systems with a high utilization of commercial electronic components or software applications with a long operational life. The extended length of a system's development can often result in obsolescence well before system production and fielding begins. Obsolescence affects individual electronic components and availability of materials, as well as access to experienced personnel, processes, and software. Legacy application software obsolescence is influenced by multiple factors. Included in these factors are hardware obsolescence, increased software maintenance, commercial off-the-shelf software obsolescence, growth in technical debt, growth in complexity, and a lack of embedded business rule documentation. These criteria influence subjective management decisions in the remediation of current or future obsolescence risk. A multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed to evaluate the impact of multiple obsolescence elements over the life cycle of a software application with consideration for the knowledge, preference, and subjectivity of experts to better inform the risk assessment and timing of future mitigation strategies. The resulting MCDM score provides a break point for a quantifiable increase in obsolescence risk.

N2  - Abstract Obsolescence occurs when system elements become outdated, and it leads to operational, logistical, reliability, and cost implications. In the U.S. military, this problem is a result of the U.S. Department of Defense's (DoD) departure from Military Specification (MILSPEC) standards in 1994 and transition to the use of Commercial Off the Shelf products. Obsolescence costs the DoD more than $750 million annually. The current risk management tools for obsolescence are based on a quantitative approach that uses cost optimization, and expert judgment is not used as a critical criterion. A review of the literature has revealed that during the design phase of technological systems, there is limited knowledge and a lack of training associated with mitigating obsolescence, and multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods are not currently used to mitigate the risk of obsolescence. Thus, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS, which is a MCDM method) and Monte Carlo simulations are proposed as the foundation for this work. This paper adds to the methodology by introducing an expert judgment criterion. A case study was conducted using military and civilian experts. Expert validation showed that the TOPSIS model successfully identified the best system for mitigating obsolescence. This model can be used by system designers and other decision makers to conduct trade studies in obsolescence management.

N2  - Abstract This paper presents a new approach to multicriteria decision analysis. They were named as processing technique of ratings for ranking of alternatives (PROTERRA). The consecutive steps of the process include normalization of the ratings, calculating of the ratings ratios within each pair of the alternatives, creating a component matrix for each of the criteria, and creating a total matrix that is the sum of the weighted component matrices. Aggregated ratings of individual alternatives result from the sums of all the values of the corresponding rows and columns of the total matrix elements. A practical application of the PROTERRA has been illustrated with an example of a decision problem concerning the choice of a shopping centre location. The analysis results of the PROTERRA are compared with other results obtained using the most popular methods, that is, analytic hierarchy process, preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations, and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution. In order to assess the stability of the ranking order obtained by the PROTERRA algorithm, the influence of weights variations on the final ranking results were tested. The sensitivity analysis was also carried out for the other methods, that is, preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations, analytic hierarchy process, and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution. On this basis, a stability of rankings resulting from all analysed methods were compared.

N2  - Summary Rice is an important cereal crop, being a staple food for over half of the world's population, and sexual reproduction resulting in grain formation underpins global food security. However, despite considerable research efforts, many of the genes, especially long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) genes, involved in sexual reproduction in rice remain uncharacterized. With an increasing number of public resources becoming available, information from different sources can be combined to perform gene functional annotation. We report the development of MCRiceRepGP, a machine learning framework which integrates heterogeneous evidence and employs multicriteria decision analysis and machine learning to predict coding and lincRNA genes involved in sexual reproduction in rice. The rice genome was reannotated using deep-sequencing transcriptomic data from reproduction-associated tissue/cell types identifying previously unannotated putative protein-coding genes and lincRNAs. MCRiceRepGP was used for genome-wide discovery of sexual reproduction associated coding and lincRNA genes. The protein-coding and lincRNA genes identified have distinct expression profiles, with a large proportion of lincRNAs reaching maximum expression levels in the sperm cells. Some of the genes are potentially linked to male- and female-specific fertility and heat stress tolerance during the reproductive stage. MCRiceRepGP can be used in combination with other genome-wide studies, such as genome-wide association studies, giving greater confidence that the genes identified are associated with the biological process of interest. As more data, especially about mutant plant phenotypes, become available, the power of MCRiceRepGP will grow, providing researchers with a tool to identify candidate genes for future experiments. MCRiceRepGP is available as a web application (http://mcgplannotator.com/MCRiceRepGP/).

N2  - Abstract In this paper, we study the well-known Bonferroni mean and develop its generalized aggregation operators in the Pythagorean fuzzy environment. More specifically, by considering the interrelationship between arguments with Pythagorean fuzzy information, we develop the Pythagorean fuzzy Bonferroni mean (PFBM) and some special properties and cases of them are also discussed. Furthermore, taking the multicriteria decision making environment into consideration, we extend the results of PFBM and develop the weighted Pythagorean fuzzy Bonferroni mean (WPFBM). Meanwhile, we also propose an approach for the application of WPFBM. However, during the application of the WPFBM operator, the calculation is very complex and time consuming. Hence, we introduce the multithreading into the application of the WPFBM operator and develop an accelerative calculating algorithm for it. To validate the performance of the accelerative calculating algorithm, we further design the corresponding experimental analysis.

N2  - Abstract The European Food Safety Authority's has established procedures for the identification of emerging risk in food and feed. The main objectives are to: (i) to carry out activities aiming at identifying, assessing and disseminating information on emerging issues and ensure coordination with relevant networks and international organisations; (ii) promote the identification of data sources and data collection and /or data generation in prioritised emerging issues; and the (iii) evaluate of the collected information and identify of emerging risks. The objective(s) of the Standing Working Group on Emerging Risks (SWG-ER) is to collaborate with EFSA on the emerging risks identification (ERI) procedure and provide strategic direction for EFSA work building on past and ongoing projects related to EFSA ERI procedure. The SWG-ER considered the ERI methodologies in place and results obtained by EFSA. It was concluded that a systematic approach to the identification of emerging issues based on experts? networks is the major strength of the procedure but at present, it is mainly focused on single issues, over short to medium time horizons, no consistent weighting or ranking is applied and clear governance of emerging risks with follow-up actions is missing. The analysis highlighted weaknesses with respect to data collection, analysis and integration. No methodology is in place to estimate the value of the procedure outputs in terms of avoided risk and there is urgent need for a communication strategy that addresses the lack of data and knowledge uncertainty and addresses risk perception issues. Recommendations were given in three areas: (i) Further develop a food system-based approach including the integration of social sciences to improve understanding of interactions and dynamics between actors and drivers and the development of horizon scanning protocols; (ii) Improve data processing pipelines to prepare big data analytics, implement a data validation system and develop data sharing agreements to explore mutual benefits; and (iii) Revise the EFSA procedure for emerging risk identification to increase transparency and improve communication.

N2  - Summary Installing new energy sources as redundant black-start (BS) units is an efficient way to enhance the speed of power system restoration, especially when there is a high risk that the available power plants considered as BS units fail to operate. In this regard, this paper provides a new optimal design for the placement of the gas turbine as the redundant energy source considering N-1 contingency analysis to improve the BS capability during restoration conditions. In doing so, there will be 2 contradictory objective functions of minimizing the maximum unavailable energy capacity and maximizing the minimum cranking path reliability. Therefore, a multiobjective problem, as a mixed integer nonlinear programming, is defined. The Pareto optimal solutions of the multiobjective problem are obtained by using a population-based meta-heuristic technique, called crow search algorithm. Two power systems are used for the validation of the proposed method. The simulation results show that the system can benefit from this method not only to increase the capability of BS generation but also to enhance the reliability of generators start-up. During the restoration process, the optimal start-up sequences of nonblack-start units and the most reliable transmission paths are also provided.

N2  - Abstract The concept of resilience and its relevance to disaster risk management has increasingly gained attention in recent years. It is common for risk and resilience studies to model system recovery by analyzing a single or aggregated measure of performance, such as economic output or system functionality. However, the history of past disasters and recent risk literature suggest that a single-dimension view of relevant systems is not only insufficient, but can compromise the ability to manage risk for these systems. In this article, we explore how multiple dimensions influence the ability for complex systems to function and effectively recover after a disaster. In particular, we compile evidence from the many competing resilience perspectives to identify the most critical resilience dimensions across several academic disciplines, applications, and disaster events. The findings demonstrate the need for a conceptual framework that decomposes resilience into six primary dimensions: workforce/population, economy, infrastructure, geography, hierarchy, and time (WEIGHT). These dimensions are not typically addressed holistically in the literature; often they are either modeled independently or in piecemeal combinations. The current research is the first to provide a comprehensive discussion of each resilience dimension and discuss how these dimensions can be integrated into a cohesive framework, suggesting that no single dimension is sufficient for a holistic analysis of a disaster risk management. Through this article, we also aim to spark discussions among researchers and policymakers to develop a multicriteria decision framework for evaluating the efficacy of resilience strategies. Furthermore, the WEIGHT dimensions may also be used to motivate the generation of new approaches for data analytics of resilience-related knowledge bases.

N2  - Abstract The quality of its players is one of the most significant features determining the failure or success of a sports team. The wide array of factors contributing to the performance of the players together with the inherent financial limitations of the clubs have transformed the selection of players into a complex problem. The current paper presents an integrated approach that combines multiple-criteria decision-making analysis and mathematical programming to support the decision maker through the building process of a soccer team. First, the fuzzy analytic network process is applied to evaluate the significance of the different performance criteria for each position in the field. The score attained by the different players in each potential position is computed using PROMETHEE II. A biobjective integer programming model has been designed to evaluate the transfer status of the players. Finally, data envelopment analysis is used to identify the most efficient Pareto solution determining the status of each player. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, the position in the field and transfer status of 60 players being considered by a real soccer team have been determined.

N2  - Abstract Attitudinal Choquet integral (ACI) extends Choquet integral (CI) through a consideration of a decision-maker's (DM's) attitudinal character. In this paper, we generalize ACI, and the resulting operator is termed as generalized ACI (GACI). GACI adds to the efficacy of the ACI in the representation of a DM's unique and complex attitudinal character. It also generates a vast range of exponential ACI operators, such as harmonic ACI, ACI, quadratic ACI, to name a few. We further present induced GACI to consider additional information that may be associated with the arguments of aggregation. The special cases of the proposed operators are investigated. The usefulness of the proposed operators in modelling human decision behavior is shown through a case study.

Partially ordered sets are the natural setting for the description and the analysis of multidimensional systems of indicators, particularly, but not exclusively, when they are of an ordinal kind. They can be used in evaluation studies, for the computation of non-aggregative synthetic indicators, for the definition of rankings, in cluster analysis, and in many other data analysis tasks. As the availability of complex ordinal data sets and multidimensional indicator systems is increasing, partially ordered sets are becoming a key tool for applied statistics, particularly in socio-economics, environmental and ecological studies, and multicriteria decision-making. Their use may involve heavy computations, but effective algorithms and software resources exist that make them a very useful tool in many concrete problems.

N2  - Abstract The objective of this study is to develop an integrated approach for solving multicriteria group decision-making problems with multigranular unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs). Firstly, a signed distance-based transformation function is proposed to unify multigranular unbalanced hesitant fuzzy linguistic (HFL) assessments. Secondly, a mathematical programming model based on the maximum consensus is constructed to allocate decision-makers (DMs)' weights objectively. Thirdly, a new signed distance-based preference score function is defined to aggregate HFL assessments and determine the weak ranking of alternatives, and a novel preference, indifference, and incomparability test framework is constructed to identify the subtle relations among alternatives. On these bases, a signed distance-based ORESTE (Organísation, rangement et Synthèse de données relarionnelles, in French) method, in which knowledge regarding criterion values and weights are expressed as multigranular unbalanced HFLTSs, is developed to obtain the ranking of alternatives. Finally, an illustrative example, followed by sensitivity and comparative analyses, is presented to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

N2  - Abstract Academic collaboration plays an important role in undergraduate research. Current methods rely on offline social contacts for undergraduate students to collaborate with academic staff members in universities and research institutions. In big data era, it is difficult for undergraduate students to find suitable research project opportunities and supervisors to work with. This paper proposes a social recommendation system for undergraduate students to find research project opportunities and work with research project teams on an academic collaboration network. The proposed recommendation method integrates relevance, connectivity, and quality modules, where profiles of undergraduates are constructed with their self-claimed information, research activities (e.g., studying and reading research publications and reading research projects), and social connections in the academic collaboration network. Suitable research projects are recommended based on the undergraduates' profiles. Experiments are conducted, and the results have shown that the proposed social recommendation system can facilitate undergraduates' selection of research projects.

N2  - Summary The efficient execution of parallel programs with respect to execution time and energy consumption is a major concern, and often, scheduling methods are used to achieve a good performance. In this article, we consider the problem of scheduling a set of independent tasks on a parallel system with homogeneous execution units providing frequency scaling. The set of tasks has the property that the tasks exhibit a task-specific inhomogeneous and non-linear behavior of their specific time-energy relation. In addition, it is assumed that execution time and energy consumption behave in a non-linear manner with respect to frequency scaling. For the assignment of these tasks to execution units, we propose a scheduling selection process combining scheduling algorithms, which determine a task assignment, with a subsequent selection of frequency scaling, which we call schedule execution modes. This process builds a rich set of alternative schedule execution modes from which efficient (or Pareto-optimal) schedule execution modes can be selected. Experiments are done for the SPEC CPU benchmarks. Experimental results illustrate that the enriched scheduling process leads to task assignments resulting in an efficient execution on DVFS processors.

N2  - Abstract We consider the problem of learning a function assigning objects into ordered categories. The objects are described by a vector of attribute values and the assignment function is monotone w.r.t. the attribute values (monotone sorting problem). Our approach is based on a model used in multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), called MR-Sort. This model determines the assigned class on the basis of a majority rule and an artificial object that is a typical lower profile of the category. MR-Sort is a simplified variant of the ELECTRE TRI method. We describe an algorithm designed for learning such a model on the basis of assignment examples. We compare its performance with choquistic regression, a method recently proposed in the preference learning community, and with UTADIS, another MCDA method leaning on an additive value function (utility) model. Our experimentation shows that MR-Sort competes with the other two methods, and leads to a model that is interpretable.

N2  - Abstract The efficacies of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are well documented in decreasing the apnoea?hypopnoea index in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. To guarantee these efficacies, CPAP manufacturers must thoroughly test these devices to ensure the flow of oxygenated air to the patient at various temperatures during a prescribed time frame. The calculation of the percent oxygen in a ?bimixture? of gas can be done by measuring the travel time of a sound wave through the gas, and the travel time is proportional to the density of the air. We utilized existing multisensor tubes that were developed to collect and measure oxygen flow, diffusion, speed, temperature, and time metrics. Then these metrics were analysed using a Markov fuzzy, statistical, artificial neural network, nearest-neighbour predictive approach to determine the interactions between these variables. An improved Kalman filter method was employed to reduce noise, increase viscosity, and obtain correct data from the CPAP system.

N2  - Summary The aim of this paper is to propose a comprehensive framework for simultaneously measuring the performance of sustainable service and manufacturing supply chain management. Application of the proposed approach also results in reduced uncertainty of the performance measurement process caused by qualitative criteria evaluation. The proposed approach consists of two main steps. First, the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method has been used to determine important criteria by avoiding low influences; and then a Mamdani fuzzy inference system model has been adopted and applied for performance evaluation of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). This model is employed in order to cope with the vagueness that exists in the SSCM performance investigation due to the vagueness intrinsic in the evaluation of criteria. In the proposed model, human reasoning has been modelled with fuzzy inference rules and has been set in the system, which is an advantage compared with those models in which fuzzy set theory and multicriteria decision-making models are integrated. The proposed approach has been implemented in the pipe and fitting industry in order to highlight its application in real life. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out to determine the influence of service and manufacturing criteria on SSCM performance. The findings reveal that sustainable manufacturing criteria compared with sustainable service criteria have more effect on the performance of SSCM.

N2  - Summary Cloud computing and cloud applications are emerging as the latest technology. Cloud applications are developing very fast and adopted by most of the firms around the globe. The cloud applications are widely accepted and considered as a notion of the digitized era, but the cloud product lifecycle management (PLM) is not adopted much in Indian firms. Cloud PLM is an upcoming cloud application, but its adoption entails various challenges. Considering this fact, the paper aims to empirically investigate the critical challenges encountered by many firms for migration to of cloud PLM. A multicriteria decision making method, grey Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory along with interpretive structural modeling are employed to identify the causal challenges and their hierarchy to cloud PLM adoption. This empirical study brings out ?data security? and ?trust on solution provider? as the most important and critical challenges for migration to cloud PLM adoption. The findings may act as a guide for the managers in manufacturing firms in identifying the critical challenges to utilize the benefits of cloud PLM over on-premise PLM systems.

N2  - Spatial decision-support systems (SDSS) combine the spatial capacities of geographic information systems with additional analysis, modeling, and scenario evaluation tools to support a single user or group of users in spatial decision-making processes. SDSS have followed the general trajectory of geographic information systems (GIS) and information communication technologies (ICT) of decreased costs and increased usability and adoption. Domains as diverse as transportation engineering, city and regional planning, water resources management, agriculture, and forestry have adopted SDSS. Currently, academic, government, and industry bodies are advancing SDSS through high-performance, web-based, and distributed computing applications that support decisions at greater data volumes.

N2  - Recently, a grid compatible Simplex variant has been demonstrated to identify optima consistently and rapidly in challenging high throughput (HT) applications in early bioprocess development. Here, this method is extended by deploying it to multi-objective optimization problems. Three HT chromatography case studies are presented, each posing challenging early development situations and including three responses which were amalgamated by the adoption of the desirability approach. The suitability of a design of experiments (DoE) methodology per case study, using regression analysis in addition to the desirability approach, was evaluated for a large number of weights and in the presence of stringent and lenient performance requirements. Despite the adoption of high-order models, this approach had low success in identification of the optimal conditions. For the deployment of the Simplex approach, the deterministic specification of the weights of the merged responses was avoided by including them as inputs in the formulated multi-objective optimization problem, facilitating this way the decision making process. This, and the ability of the Simplex method to locate optima, rendered the presented approach highly successful in delivering rapidly operating conditions, which belonged to the Pareto set and offered a superior and balanced performance across all outputs compared to alternatives. Moreover, its performance was relatively independent of the starting conditions and required sub-minute computations despite its higher order mathematical functionality compared to DoE techniques. These evidences support the suitability of the grid compatible Simplex method for early bioprocess development studies involving complex data trends over multiple responses. ? 2018 The Authors Biotechnology Progress published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

N2  - Abstract The purpose of this paper is to evaluate Turkish banks' multidimensional corporate sustainability performance and whether banks' sustainability efforts are value related. Both qualitative and quantitative data analysis, namely content analysis, entropy based and TOPSIS techniques, have been utilized in order to measure the sustainability performance. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient has been employed to investigate the nexus between overall sustainability performance scores of the banks and market value during the years 2013 and 2015. The results of this study are insignificant in the ongoing debate on whether Turkish banks' sustainability efforts are value related. However, a significant and positive relationship has been found between the financial sustainability performance and the market value in the long run. Additionally, a multidimensional corporate sustainability model that has the five dimensions of economic, environmental, social, governance and financial disclosures has been proposed. This paper is among the first to explore the nexus between sustainability performance and market value in Turkey.

N2  - Abstract Generalized orthopair fuzzy sets are extensions of ordinary fuzzy sets by relaxing restrictions on the degrees of support for and support against. Correlation analysis is to measure the statistical relationships between two samples or variables. In this paper, we propose a function measuring the interrelation of two -rung orthopair fuzzy sets, whose range is the unit interval . First, the correlation and correlation coefficient of -rung orthopair membership grades are presented, and their basic properties are investigated. Second, these concepts are extended to -rung orthopair fuzzy sets on discrete universes. Then, we discuss their applications in cluster analysis under generalized orthopair fuzzy environments. And, a real-world problem involving the evaluation of companies is used to illustrate the detailed processes of the clustering algorithm. Finally, we introduce the correlation and correlation coefficient of -rung orthopair fuzzy sets on both bounded and unbounded continuous universes and provide some numerical examples to substantiate such arguments.

N2  - Summary Recent advancements in web-based application, especially in cloud computing environment, allows cloud service providers to deploy and provide web-based services in the form of multitier applications. One of the most suitable infrastructure for the running of multitier applications is a cloud computing infrastructure. Since the arrival rate of users to the multitier applications varies over the time, deciding about the right amount of resources required to handle the each tier of multitier applications is not trivial, and it depends on the current workload of its each tier. Therefore, it is necessary to automatically provision resources to deal with fluctuating demands of the multitier applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid resource provisioning approach for multitier applications based on a combination of the concept of the autonomic computing and the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process approach. Moreover, we present a framework based on MAPE-k control loop for autonomous resource provisioning of multitier applications in cloud computing environments. The effectiveness of the proposed approach under real and synthetic workloads was evaluated. The experimental results indicate that the proposed solution outperforms in terms of allocated virtual machines, response time, and cost compared with the other approaches.

N2  - Abstract We propose a new generalization of the discrete Choquet integral based on an arbitrary bivariate symmetric averaging function (mean). So far only the means with a natural multivariate extension were used for this purpose. In this paper, we use a general method based on a pruned binary tree to extend symmetric means with no obvious multivariate form, such as the logarithmic, identric, Heronian, Lagrangean, and Cauchy means. The generalized Choquet integral is built by computing the extensions of the bivariate means of the ordered inputs, and includes some existing extensions as special cases. Our construction is illustrated with multiple examples.

N2  - Abstract Human beings represent and process imperfect information in a natural way, whereas effective approaches are still being looked for in the area of soft computing. Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy sets and especially Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy relations are are tools that make it possible to model in an effective way imperfect information. In this paper, we discuss the transitivity problem of Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy relations. The transitivity property reflects the consistency of a preference relation. Therefore, transitivity is important from the point of view of real problems appearing, e.g., in group decision making, choice, and utility theories widely making use of the preference procedures. We study here in detail transitivity property of Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy relations and propose a new algorithm for generating weakly transitivity among the alternatives (options) considered. Next, making use of the new algorithm we propose a procedure of ranking of the alternatives in a group decision-making problem.

N2  - Abstract In this paper, we presented 10 similarity measures between Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) based on the cosine function by considering the degree of membership, degree of nonmembership and degree of hesitation in PFSs. Then, we applied these similarity measures and weighted similarity measures between PFSs to pattern recognition and medical diagnosis. Finally, two illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the similarity measures for pattern recognition and medical diagnosis.

N2  - Abstract In the conservation of endangered species, suppression of a population of one native species to benefit another poses challenges. Examples include predator control and nest parasite reduction. Less obvious is the control of blood-feeding arthropods. We conducted a case study of the effect of native black flies (Simulium spp.) on reintroduced Whooping Cranes (Grus americana). Our intent was to provide a science-driven approach for determining the effects of blood-feeding arthropods on endangered vertebrates and identifying optimal management actions for managers faced with competing objectives. A multiyear experiment demonstrated that black flies reduce nest success in cranes by driving incubating birds off their nests. We used a decision-analytic approach to develop creative management alternatives and evaluate trade-offs among competing objectives. We identified 4 management objectives: establish a self-sustaining crane population, improve crane well-being, maintain native black flies as functional components of the ecosystem, and minimize costs. We next identified potential management alternatives: do nothing, suppress black flies, force crane renesting to occur after the activity period of black flies, relocate releases of cranes, suppress black flies and relocate releases, or force crane renesting and relocate releases. We then developed predictions on constructed scales of 0 (worst-performing alternative) to 1 (best-performing alternative) to indicate how alternative actions performed in terms of management objectives. The optimal action depended on the relative importance of each objective to a decision maker. Only relocating releases was a dominated alternative, indicating that it was not optimal regardless of the relative importance of objectives. A rational decision maker could choose any other management alternative we considered. Recognizing that decisions involve trade-offs that must be weighed by decision makers is crucial to identifying alternatives that best balance multiple management objectives. Given uncertainty about the population dynamics of blood-feeding arthropods, an adaptive management approach could offer substantial benefits.

N2  - Abstract The main feature of Pythagorean fuzzy sets is that it is characterized by five parameters, namely membership degree, nonmembership degree, hesitancy degree, strength of commitment about membership, and direction of commitment. In this paper, we first investigate four existing comparison methods for ranking Pythagorean fuzzy sets and point out by examples that the method proposed by Yager, which considers the influence fully of the five parameters, is more efficient than the other ones. Later, we propose a variety of distance measures for Pythagorean fuzzy sets and Pythagorean fuzzy numbers, which take into account the five parameters of Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Based on the proposed distance measures, we present some similarity measures of Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Furthermore, a multiple criteria Pythagorean fuzzy group decision-making approach is proposed. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the validity and applicability of the presented group decision-making method.

N2  - Abstract The cold-chain information has characterized by the loss and dispersion according to the different collecting methods. The description for the quality decay factors of aquatic products can be defined as the multidimensional information. A series of nodes with multidimensional information are assembled to be hierarchies aiming at describing the environment conditions and locations in the supply chain. Each of the single hierarchy levels constitutes a sequence of node information in a network, which is applied as internal information analysis. The cross-layer information structure is defined as ?bridge? information which is able to record the information transmissions among every hierarchy from the point of view of the whole chain. The study has established a novel structured modeling to describe the cold chain of aquatic products based on a network-hierarchy framework. An organized and sustainable transmission process can be built and recorded by the multidimensional attributes for the whole course of cold chain of aquatic products. In addition, seamless connections among every hierarchy are attainable by the environmental information records continuously to monitor the quality of aquatic products. The quality assessments and shelf life predictions are estimated properly as the risk control in order to monitor and trace the safety of aquatic products under the supply chain perspective.

N2  - Abstract This research evaluates performance of a rapid assessment framework for screening surface water flood risk in urban catchments. Recent advances in modelling have developed fast and computationally efficient cellular automata frameworks which demonstrate promising utility for increasing available evidence to support surface water management, however, questions remain regarding trade-offs between accuracy and speed for practical application. This study evaluates performance of a rapid assessment framework by comparing results with outputs from an industry standard hydrodynamic model using a case study of St Neots in Cambridgeshire, UK. Results from the case study show that the rapid assessment framework is able to identify and prioritise areas of flood risk and outputs flood depths which correlate above 97% with the industry standard approach. In theory, this finding supports a simplified representation of catchments using cellular automata, and in practice presents an opportunity to apply the framework to develop evidence to support detailed modelling.

N2  - Abstract This chapter examines detailed project requirements, constraints, and assumptions with stakeholders based on the project charter and lessons learned. The scope management plan is the culmination of the processes needed to guarantee that the project includes all the work required to complete the project successfully. It also works to make sure that the project focuses only on the work required to complete the project and does not include unneeded tasks. The project charter communicates the high-level goals, business needs, assumptions, and constraints. It is used in this process to align the scope management plan with stakeholder expectations. The requirements management plan defines how the requirements will be analyzed, documented, and managed throughout all phases of the project. The type of phase relationship used to manage the project will determine how requirements are managed throughout the project. Lateral thinking is a process of separating problems, looking at them from angles other than their obvious presentation, and encouraging team members to come up with ways to solve problems that are not apparently obvious or look at scope in a different way.

N2  - Summary Many hospitals encounter surgery cancelations for various reasons. We present a methodology applying data mining and simulation to optimize operating room (OR) scheduling in a urology department in West China Hospital. To the best of our knowledge, this is 1 of the first efforts to seek an optimal schedule solution based on cancelation risk of elective surgeries as well as OR allocation between elective and nonelective surgeries. First, chi-square test and random forest prediction modeling were used to predict potential elective surgeries with high cancelation risk, and the factors, including surgeon, number of days since admission of patient, first surgery or not, etc., that influence elective surgery cancelation were identified. Second, a simulation technology was designed to compare 7 different scheduling strategies. The results demonstrated that for elective surgery, cancelation rate low surgery first outperformed the others and increased the productivity of the ORs from 72% to 83%, while for nonelective surgery performed in a separate OR, there was no improvement because the supply was greater than necessary at present. However, in total, the selected strategies led to 7% higher productivity.

N2  - Summary Purpose The study aims to evaluate the comprehensive relationship between patient satisfaction and five dimensions of health care service quality in Pakistani public/private health care sectors, using a novel grey relational analysis (GRA) models and the Hurwicz criteria of decision making under uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from private and public health care facilities of Pakistan through an improved SERVQUAL instrument. Deng's GRA, absolute GRA, and the second synthetic GRA models were applied to address the problem under study. Findings Grey relational analysis models revealed that reliability and responsiveness are most strongly predicting patient satisfaction in public and private health care sectors, respectively. The Hurwicz criteria showed that patients are more likely to be satisfied from private health care facilities. Limitations/implications Limitations of SERVQUAL model are also the limitations of the study; eg, the study suggests that because of the absence of ?cost,? which is a key quality indicator of Pakistani public sector health care facilities, the model was unable to comprehensively evaluate the health care situation in light of the observations of price-focused Pakistani patients. The study recommends tailoring of SERVQUAL model for the resource-scant and underdeveloped countries where people's evaluation of the quality of the hospitals is likely to be influenced by the price of services. Originality/value The study is a pioneer in health care evaluation of public and private sectors of Lahore and Rawalpindi while using GRA models, in general, and the second synthetic GRA model, in particular. It presents an alternative method to the statistical way of analyzing data by successfully demonstrating the use of grey methods, which can make reasonable decisions even through small samples.

N2  - Summary The complexity of the multiple interdependent and interconnected subsystems constitutes a major challenge in modeling and managing complex systems of systems (Complex SoS). This chapter explores some systemic risks to Complex SoS by analyzing a unique failure mechanism caused by interdependencies among its subsystems through shared state variables from a control perspective. An analysis of a multiobjective sequential decision process of a nonlinear SoS reveals some inherent systemic risks among its subsystems. The chapter develops a systemic precursor analysis framework for Complex SoS that builds on a proactive, dynamic anticipatory analysis methodology. It presents the development and application of key risk analysis theories and methodologies for managing this physical infrastructure Complex SoS effectively and efficiently. The chapter introduces a systemic precursor analysis framework for a Bridge Complex SoS, with the goal to support informed risk management decision making while reducing hindsight bias in using precursors.

N2  - The strategic use of intellectual property (IP) is crucial for technology-based companies to gain competitive advantage. The recent transformation of the US patent system brings new challenges and opportunities in this arena. In this regard, this study attempts to identify techniques which can help with IP evaluation and selection in the fuzzy front end (FFE) of new product development (NPD) process. This study combines data collection methods such as mining the literature, conducting in-depth interviews, surveying questionnaires, and analyzing cases. This research serves as an analysis of modern literature and identifies a multicriteria weighted scoring model that can be employed to help with the patent decision process. The criterion to discern patent eligibility is a contended discussion. For this survey administration, 300 companies, as the targeted sample, were randomly selected to be reached from LexisNexis database. Consequently, this paper identifies the key decision criteria to incorporate into this model and obtains weights gathered from surveying IP professionals and R&D managers in US-based electronics manufacturing firms (SIC code: 36). This study proposes a structured approach to identify ideas that should be patented in the FFE of NPD process by way of an analysis of pertaining literature and case studies. The technique we present in this paper could be essential for many firms to achieve IP success as their strategic means. Moreover, this tool can help R&D managers not only speed up the FFE of NPD process but also make more informed and target-worthy decisions for IP filing.

N2  - Abstract Complexity negatively impacts the process of continually improving performance management systems (PMSs). The extant PMS literature considers complexity to be a result of the external environment rather than a user response to that environment. However, this paper argues that organizations generally face internal complexity when adopting PMSs. Introducing PMSs into an organization can have varied effects in those organizations based on the complexity of an organization's associated members and its interactions. This study aims to understand the emergence of complexities while implementing and using PMSs in organizations. From the complexity theory perspective, four system properties (ontological, teleological, genetic and functional) are used to understand complexity in PMSs. The paper builds on a systematic literature review consisting of 76 papers and analyses them in the light of exploring sources of complexity when implementing and using PMSs. From the outset, complexity is understood to be a result of the conflict between existing organizational practices and mechanisms and the organizational controls associated with PMSs. The key findings abstracted six sources of complexity in this study: role, task and procedural types of complexity associated with the social dimension, and methodological, analytical and technological types of complexity associated with the technical dimension. The study findings contribute to the current discussion regarding why PMSs typically lag and are not responsive and resilient in emerging contexts. While understanding and exploring all organizational controls that moderate a PMS is useful, organizations should construct the necessary capabilities, depending on their context and adapt to the changes associated with PMSs.

N2  - Summary This chapter reviews detailed project requirements, constraints, and assumptions with stakeholders based on the project charter, lessons learned, and requirement gathering techniques to establish the project deliverables. The chapter describes the Develop Project Management Plan process that outlines the overall approach one uses to manage the project. The result of this process is the project management plan document that describes how one will execute, monitor, and control the project outcomes as the project progresses and how one will close out the project once it concludes. The first process in the Planning process group is the Develop Project Management Plan process. The Develop Project Management Plan process brings all these subsidiary plans together, along with the outputs of the Planning group processes, into one document called the project management plan. Planning processes on large projects are completed mostly by the project management team. Team members are brought onto the project when work is ready to begin, and a large kickoff meeting is held to explain the objectives of the project, to gain buy-in from the project team members, and to explain roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders and team members.

N2  - Abstract Vegetation plays a vital role for sustainable rehabilitation of degraded lands such as badlands with active gully erosion. However, the establishment of plant species on badlands remains a long-lasting challenge in most regions, including the subhumid tropics. To address this challenge, 18 multipurpose plant species (six trees, three shrubs, and nine grasses), which were preselected from the regional species pool in Southwest Ethiopia, were planted in a badland and monitored from July 2011 to June 2014. The experiment had a split-plot design with farmyard manure (FYM) application as main plot and plant species as subplot factors repeated in three blocks. The study revealed that grasses were the most successful to survive and rehabilitate the gully within the monitoring period compared with trees and shrubs. The survival rate of the four most successful grass species, Chrysopogon zizanioides, Pennisetum macrourum, Pennisetum polystachion, and Pennisetum purpureum ranged from 61% to 90% with FYM application and from 20% to 85% without FYM, while most of the well-known indigenous and exotic trees and shrubs failed to survive. For the grass P. purpureum, shoot height, shoot, and root biomass were enhanced by 300%, 342%, and 578%, respectively, due to FYM application, with a remarkably higher response to FYM compared with all the other studied species. The overall results demonstrate that badlands can be effectively restored by using early successional species such as locally adapted and selected grasses before the plantation of trees and shrubs.

N2  - Abstract This chapter offers guidance on how to develop the cost management plan based upon the project scope, schedule, resources, approved project charter-and other information, using estimating techniques, in order to manage project costs. The chapter offers guidance on how to develop the quality management plan and define the quality standards for the project and its products, based on the project scope, risks, and requirements to prevent the occurrence of defects and reduce the cost of quality. The cost management plan plays an important role within all of the Project Cost Management Knowledge Area processes. The cost management plan is created during the Plan Cost Management process and is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. Several enterprise environmental factors can influence the Plan Cost Management process, including but not limited to the organization's culture and structure, marketplace conditions, and currency exchange rates. Cost estimates from individuals who have had previous experience in the past on similar projects can be used. Information from those who have experience in performing the activities becomes valuable for calculating accurate estimates.

N2  - Abstract This chapter examines how to measure project performance using appropriate tools and techniques in order to identify and quantify any variances and corrective actions. The chapter also offers guidance on how to manage changes to the project by following the change management plan in order to ensure that project goals remain aligned with business needs. The Monitor and Control Project Work process involves monitoring all the processes in the Initiating, Planning, Executing, and Closing process groups to meet the performance objectives outlined in the project management plan. The Control Procurements process is concerned with monitoring the vendor's performance and ensuring that all requirements of the contract are met. This process also manages the procurement relationships overall and makes changes and corrections as needed. Work performance information reflects performance data of the vendor that has been analyzed. The information will be used to make decisions about any corrective action or changes needed regarding the vendor's performance. Managing and reporting on project progress is the primary focus of the Monitoring and Controlling processes. One of the Monitoring and Controlling processes is Validate Scope. The primary purpose of the Validate Scope process is to formally accept completed deliverables and obtain sign-off that the deliverables are satisfactory and meet stakeholders' expectation.

N2  - Abstract Chemical complexity of natural products often results in their pharmacological polypotency. However, selecting a natural product with desirable activity profile is not a straightforward task, especially if optimization of one feature results in deterioration of other facets. Recently, in the field of multiobjective optimization, the sum of ranking differences (SRD) has emerged as a simple and statistically sound method for fusion of multiple criteria. However, the data pretreatment seems to strongly influence the ranking outcome, which may lead to ambiguous or even false interpretations. Therefore, in the present study, the data of 55 essential oils originated from different plant species and tested on multiple bacterial and fungal strains as well as 4 antioxidative assays were studied. Essential oils were ranked using the classical Deringer desirability approach, and results were compared with the SRD analysis of primary activity data as well as the previously row-wise standardized data, normalized data, and the data scaled to fit the preferences. Ultimately, the most promising candidate (polypotent) essential oils, as well as the most resilient and most sensitive bacterial and fungal strains, and antioxidative assays were identified. Data transformation based on the Deringer desirability approach, compared with the data that have not been previously transformed or those that transformed using a row-wise standardization or normalization to the unit length vector, seemed to be the crucial step providing the sound and meaningful SRD ranking.

N2  - Abstract Rationale, aims, and objectives The application of resilience in health care requires the shift from a cause-effect approach to a systemic approach, yet few tools have been developed to measure resilience potential in this specific context. This study tests a resilience assessment grid (RAG) questionnaire to measure the resilience of anaesthesiologists, with a cross-country survey. Method A study was conducted with an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) questionnaire containing 57 detailed questions; 16 nations and 172 respondents were involved in the study. The data were statistically analysed to identify insights from the questionnaire, main improvements for further assessment, and confirmation of the design of the questionnaire. The questionnaire reliability was assessed by Cronbach analysis. Weak items were identified by a detailed correlations analysis and through a weight-polarization matrix. Construct validity was confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). Results The α level of Cronbach analysis is 0.910. PCA and FA confirmed the absence of underlying unexpected factors, with less than 8% from the first factor and a total of just 54% of variability explained by 17 factors. Suggestions for revising the questionnaire ensue from the analysis, with improvements for the questionnaire's significance. Conclusion The questionnaire shows the potential to assess proxy measures of resilience, even confirming the relevance of a structured weighting approach based on the AHP. The exemplar statistical cross-country analyses encourage the widespread use of a centralized resilience questionnaire to support standardized analyses and the diffusion of best practices among organizations.

N2  - In order to improve the efficiency of climate change initiatives China launched its national carbon market in December 2017. Initial CO2 quota allocations are a matter of significant concern. How should we allocate CO2 emissions reduction responsibilities among Chinese provinces, assuming that provinces will not or cannot trade these responsibilities among themselves? In this paper, we allocate CO2 quota from the perspective of cost minimisation. First, we estimate the national CO2 marginal abatement cost (MAC) function and deduce the interprovincial MAC functions. Second, we build an allocation model with nonlinear programming for cost minimisation. Finally, we obtain the allocation results under the emissions reduction target by 2030. The results are as follows. (i) The national MAC was 134.3 Yuan/t (at the constant price of 1978) in 2011, with an overall upward trend from 1990 to 2011. (ii) The interprovincial MACs differ significantly and decline gradually from east to west. Hebei has the largest emissions reduction quota, and Shandong has the largest emissions quota by 2030. (iii) Compared with other criteria of per capita, gross domestic product (GDP), grandfathering and carbon intensity, the proposed approach is the most cost-effective in achieving the reduction target, with cost savings of 37.7, 34.5, 47.9 and 33.87 per cent, respectively.

N2  - Summary Nowadays, a huge number of available Web services offer the same functionalities and a high quality of service, which makes the selection of suitable services a difficult task. In such situation, the services must be differentiated by additional criteria such as users' ratings. To meet this goal, recommendation techniques become a natural choice to cope with the challenging task of optimal service selection and to help consumers satisfy their needs and preferences. However, most existing models on service recommendation are static, whereas in the real world, the perception and popularity of Web services may continually change, and users' preferences and habits also shift frequently. Time is becoming an increasingly important factor in recommender systems, since time effects influence users' preferences to a large extent. In addition, quality-of-service performance of Web services is strongly linked to the service status and network environments, which are variable against time. Recently, a wide range of service recommendation approaches, dealing with the time dimension in user modeling and recommendation strategies, have been proposed. Thus, the purpose of this survey is to present a comprehensive study and analysis of the state-of-the-art on time-aware service recommendation. We identify the techniques used in recommender systems to provide the best services. Moreover, we present a classification of time-aware recommender systems based on the target recommendation time, the type of relationship between users, and the type of feedback. Besides, we present a comparison between time-aware recommendation approaches, and we discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, challenges and requirements of time-aware service recommendation as well as the future directions are identified according to the studied approaches.

N2  - Summary This chapter offers guidance on how to develop the human resource management plan by defining the roles and responsibilities of the project team members in order to create a project organizational structure and provide guidance regarding how resources will be assigned and managed. Project managers need to work in close coordination with the procurement officers, and the roles and responsibilities of each should be clearly understood. In all but the smallest of organizations, a project manager does not usually have the authority to enter into a procurement agreement. The project manager and the project team will be responsible for coordinating all the organizational interfaces for the project, including technical, human resources, purchasing, and finance. A contract is a compulsory agreement between two or more parties and is used to acquire products or services from outside the organization.

N2  - The exhaustive nature of fossil fuels and environmental concerns associated with greenhouse gases are the major causes of the paradigm shift from conventional vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs). The electrification of the transportation sector and the increasing popularity of the EVs have driven scientists and researchers to delve into charging stations. Underdeveloped charging infrastructure, optimal placement of charging stations, and charge scheduling in the charging stations are the major concerns for the large-scale deployment of EVs. Even few questions related to EVs, such as the vehicle price and driving range, can be partially solved with a well-developed charging infrastructure. Existing old infrastructure may bring severe limitations in the realization of the optimal placement of charging stations as EVs have not existed when the road and grid infrastructure have been developed. For the past few years, the studies associated with the optimal placement and sizing of EV charging stations have drawn the consideration of the researchers. The researchers have used different approaches, objective functions, and applied different optimization algorithms while dealing with the problem of charging station placement. The complex and dynamic nature of the problem has led researchers to apply different optimization algorithms for the solution of the problem. In this particular review study, the research works bearing on the charging infrastructure planning for the EVs are considered. Thus, this review work will endow the research community with the latest developments and research findings in the paradigm of charging infrastructure planning for EVs.

N2  - Summary This chapter explores the application of the theory of building performance to the actual design and construction of buildings. It explores the general processes of performance-based design and integrated (integral) design, often discussed in the literature, as well as the early (conceptual) stages. It emphasizes that there are some subprocesses within design that have inherent process logic that may be supported, while the overall design process remains highly unique and flexible. The chapter then zooms in on specific design decisions that may be supported and theory about decision making that may be employed. It positions optimization, visualization and communication as important aspects of the design decision-making process.

N2  - Abstract The construction of fishways for upstream and downstream connectivity is the preferred mitigation measure for hydropower dams and other riverine barriers. Yet empirical evidence for effective design criteria for many species is missing. We therefore assembled a group of international fishway designers and combined their knowledge with available empirical data using a formal expert elicitation protocol and Bayesian networks. The expert elicitation method we use minimizes biases typically associated with such approaches. Demonstrating our application with a case-study on the temperate Southern Hemisphere, we use the resulting probabilistic models to predict the following, given alternative design parameters: (i) the effectiveness of technical fishways for upstream movement of migratory fish; (ii) habitat quality in nature-like bypasses for resident fish; and (iii) rates of mortality during downstream passage of all fish through turbines and spillways. The Fish Passage Network (Fish-Net) predicts that fishways for native species could be near 0% or near 100% efficient depending on their design, suggesting great scope for adequate mitigation. Sensitivity analyses revealed the most important parameters as follows: (i) design of attraction and entrance features of technical fishways for upstream migration; (ii) habitat preferences of resident fish in nature-like bypasses; and (iii) susceptibility of fish to barotrauma and blade strike during turbine passage. Numerical modelling predicted that mortality rates of small-bodied fish (50?100 mm TL) due to blade strike may be higher for Kaplan than Francis turbines. Our findings can be used to support environmentally sustainable decisions in the planning, design and monitoring stages of hydropower development.

N2  - ABSTRACT Threats to the individual identity on social media are real and problematic. Yet, there is a paucity of research on online identity management. We posit that identity management on social media requires a value perspective to determine gaps between what social media users want from online identity management and what social media sites offer through their current security and privacy controls. Following the design science research paradigm, we present an Identity Management Value Model (IMVM). Based on multiple-objectives decision analysis technique, the value model explicates a hierarchy of fundamental identity management objectives and quantifies the achievement of objectives on a social media site. The emergent value scores and value gaps provide an understanding of how well a social media site manages users online identity. We demonstrate the application of the value model for Facebook and assess a set of measures to reduce the value gaps on Facebook. We conducted sensitivity analysis followed by deterministic analysis to evaluate the value model. The evaluation results indicate that the modeling outcome is robust to a range of individual values and preferences. By focusing on individual values, this study extends the research on values in the context of identity management on social media. Social media companies might find the model useful for instituting identity management measures. Individual users could use the model for strategizing about personal identity management. Our study also demonstrates the usefulness of a retrospective design approach, accounting for user values in a principled and comprehensive manner.

N2  - Abstract This chapter offers guidance on how to develop the communications management plan based on the project organizational structure and stakeholder requirements in order to define and manage the flow of project information. The chapter also offers guidance on how to develop the procurement management plan based on the project scope, budget, and schedule in order to ensure that the required project resources will be available. The project manager creates a resource management plan by carrying out a process called Plan Resource Management. Through this process, roles and responsibilities of the project team members are defined and the strategies for using and managing the project team, equipment, and inventory are documented. The resource management plan documents how and when resources are introduced to the project and the criteria for releasing them. The plan should be updated throughout the project. The Plan Communications Management process involves determining the communication needs of the stakeholders by defining the types of information needed, the format for communicating the information, how often it's distributed, and who prepares it.

N2  - Abstract This chapter offers guidance on how to obtain and manage project resources, including outsourced deliverables, by following the procurement plan in order to ensure successful project execution. The chapter offers guidance on how to maximize team performance through leading, mentoring, training, and motivating team members. The organizational process assets input refers to the standard processes, policies, procedures, and guidelines that the organization has in place. This includes policies around acquiring external resources. Decision-making techniques used in this process include, but are not limited to, multi-criteria decision analysis. Multi-criteria decision analysis involves the use of selection criteria to make decisions on whether potential project team members are a fit. Criteria are typically assigned a weight based on their level of importance, and candidates are then rated against the criteria. Project team assignments are based on the results of negotiating and determining elements such as the roles and responsibilities and reviewing recruitment practices. This output also results in a published project team directory, which lists the names of all project team members and stakeholders.

N2  - Summary This chapter discusses how to manage task execution based on the project management plan by leading and developing the project team in order to achieve project deliverables. The chapter defines five processes, including Conduct Procurements, Manage Quality, Manage Communications, Manage Project Knowledge, and Manage Stakeholder Engagement. A company's Internet site, professional journals, and newspapers are examples of where advertising might appear. In reality, most organizations, including government organizations, have replaced advertising in the newspaper with advertising on their own websites. Bidder conferences are meetings with prospective vendors or sellers that occur prior to the completion of their response proposal. Screening systems use pre-defined performance criteria or a set of defined minimum requirements to screen out unsuitable vendors. Complex contracts may encompass any number of elements, including financing options, overall schedule, proprietary rights, service-level agreements, technical aspects, and more.

N2  - Summary Physical infrastructures, serving as the foundations of society's well-being and encompassing household and the entire private and public sectors, are the driving force of today's worldwide economic prosperity. This chapter focuses on fault trees and fault-tree analyses for modeling transportation Complex Systems of Systems (SoS). Transportation is an emergent safety-critical interdependent and interconnected sector of the economy, which in its essence constitutes Complex SoS. The chapter also focuses primarily on how automobile accidents occur and addresses the broader challenge of quantifying and managing the risk inherent in particular automobile designs and automobiles and the environment within which they operate as Complex SoS. The function of the Vehicle Complex SoS is to physically transport passengers in safety and comfort according to the directional and speed instructions given to it by the driver. Fault-tree modeling of accident occurrence is an effective framework for describing accident causation in both quantitative and qualitative terms.

N2  - Summary This chapter offers risks on how one can present future opportunities as well as future threats to a project. Risk events may occur due to one reason or several reasons with multiple impacts. The Project Risk Management Knowledge Area is concerned with identifying the risks to the project, analyzing, ranking, and prioritizing them, developing response plans to deal with the risk should it occur, and monitoring and controlling risks throughout the project. Failing to address individual or project risks could cause financial loss, damage the organization's reputation, extend the project timeline, or have any number of other unpleasant outcomes. Risk appetite is the level of uncertainty the stakeholders are willing to accept in exchange for the potential positive impacts of the risk. Risk threshold is different from risk appetite because risk appetite concerns the amount of uncertainty users are willing to take on to gain a benefit, whereas risk threshold concerns the amount of risk.

N2  - Summary This chapter is divided into two parts. The first part presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in the subsequent chapters of this book. It demonstrates the impracticality of representing, within a single model, all the aspects of an interdependent and interconnected complex systems of systems (Complex SoS), which may be of interest at any given time to its management, government regulators, students, or any other stakeholder. A history of the discipline of systems engineering and the development of systems of systems with their unique complexities provide the base upon which to build new methods of modeling and managing interdependent and interconnected Complex SoS. The second part of the chapter highlights the centrality of the relationships among the vulnerability and resilience of, and the risk to, Complex SoS.

N2  - Summary This chapter introduces graded logic (GL) as a system of realistic models of observable properties of human aggregation reasoning. It presents a survey of classical bivalent Boolean logic and introduces evaluation logic as a weighted compensative generalization of the classical Boolean logic. The chapter identifies and analyzes the characteristic properties of human evaluation logic reasoning. It also presents the three most important forms of andness/orness: local andness, mean local andness, and global andness. The chapter focuses on the mathematical properties and various implementations of the graded conjunction/disjunction (GCD) aggregators. In GL simultaneity and substitutability are modeled using the GCD. The most important simple aggregator in GL is GCD, and the most important compound aggregator is the partial absorption (PA). The percept of importance is the fundamental component in evaluation reasoning and in intuitive aggregation of degrees of truth. The chapter investigates the use of negation as a component in both idempotent and nonidempotent GL functions.
