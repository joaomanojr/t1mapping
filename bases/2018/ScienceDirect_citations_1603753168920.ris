AB  - It is essential for public health to understand what drives people's hesitance towards vaccination. Theoretical models of vaccination decisions are ubiquitous, often incorporating herd immunity, perceptions of vaccine-related side-effects (VRSE) and of vaccine-preventable burden of disease, but with little to no empirical exploration. Herd immunity is a (usually) positive externality where vaccinated individuals influence others' risks by their reduced capability to transmit an infectious disease to them. It is often assumed that (rational) individuals incorporate this externality in their strategic vaccination decision, from which free-riding behavior arises. We performed a Bayesian D-efficient discrete choice experiment in February–March 2017 to study vaccination behavior in 1919 Belgian respondents. Choice sets with vaccine profiles were constructed using six attributes: vaccine effectiveness, VRSE, accessibility (in terms of convenience and reimbursement), vaccine-preventable burden of disease, local (respondents' network of contacts) vaccination coverage, and population (the population at large) vaccination coverage. VRSE and accessibility are the most influential attributes, followed by vaccine effectiveness and burden of disease. Both population and local coverage are less important than the other attributes, but show a significant direct linear relationship with vaccine utility. This supports the existence of peer influence (more incentivized as more and more vaccinate), rather than free-riding on herd immunity. These findings were independent of whether respondents made vaccine choices for themselves or for their child. Around 40% of the respondents indicated accepting vaccination with little or no questioning. These ‘acceptors’ were less sensitive to changes in the vaccine-preventable burden of disease for their child's vaccination choices (but not for themselves). Public health institutions are critical in stimulating vaccine uptake by making vaccines conveniently available at an affordable price and by communicating pro-actively on perceived VRSEs. The free-riding assumption as a driver of individual vaccine decisions, seems inappropriate, but this observation needs confirming in other populations.

AB  - In recent years, water resources management has become more complicated and controversial due to the impacts of various factors affecting hydrological systems. System Dynamics (SD) has in turn become increasingly popular due to its advantages as a tool for dealing with such complex systems. However, SD also has some limitations. This review contains a comprehensive survey of the existing literature on SD as a potential method to deal with the complexity of system integrated modeling, with a particular focus on the application of SD to the integrated modeling of water resources systems. It discusses the limitations of SD in these contexts, and highlights a number of studies which have applied a combination of SD and other methods to overcome these limitations. Finally, our study makes a number of recommendations for future modifications in the application of SD methods in order to enhance their performance.

AB  - We introduce a special issue that aims to simultaneously motivate interest in uncertainty assessment (UA) and reduce the barriers practitioners face in conducting it. The issue, “Demonstrating transparent, feasible, and useful uncertainty assessment in ecosystem services modeling,” responds to findings from a 2016 workshop of academics and practitioners that identified challenges and potential solutions to enhance the practice of uncertainty assessment in the ES community. Participants identified that one important gap was the lack of a compelling set of cases showing that UA can be feasibly conducted at varying levels of sophistication, and that such assessment can usefully inform decision-relevant modeling conclusions. This article orients the reader to the 11 other articles that comprise the special issue, and which span multiple methods and application domains, all with an explicit consideration of uncertainty. We highlight the value of UA demonstrated in the articles, including changing decisions, facilitating transparency, and clarifying the nature of evidence. We conclude by suggesting ways to promote further adoption of uncertainty analysis in ecosystem service assessments. These include: Easing the analytic workflows involved in UA while guarding against rote analyses, applying multiple models to the same problem, and learning about the conduct and value of UA from other disciplines.

AB  - This study aims to determine the best location for the construction of a wind-solar hybrid plant in Fars, Iran. For this purpose, seven regions of the Fars province are studied in terms of four criteria of economic, social, and geological conditions as well as natural disasters. First, the most important factors, wind power and solar irradiation, are obtained by using the Weibull distribution function and the Angstrom–Prescott equation based on the long-term 3-hourly data pertaining to 2006–2015 collected from the Iran Meteorological Organization, respectively. The data analysis and ranking are performed with the fuzzy TOPSIS. The results show that Eghlid is the best option for the construction of a wind-solar plant. According to the obtained results, the cities of Firuzabad, Estahban, Safashahr, Bavanat, Izadkhast and Arsanjan hold the next ranks in terms of suitability for the construction of solar-wind hybrid plants.

AB  - One of the key issues of the sustainable development in all countries is industrial productivity improvement, especially the production capacity improvement and energy-saving of complex chemical processes. Therefore, this paper proposes a production prediction and energy-saving model based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) integrated Interpretative Structural Modeling (ISM) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The factors that affect the productivity are divided into different levers by the ISM. And then the attributes of each layer are fused by the AHP based on the entropy weight, which greatly reduces the complexity of the input attributes. Moreover, the production prediction and energy-saving model is established based on the ELM. Compared with the traditional ELM, the validity and the practicability of the proposed method are verified by University of California Irvine (UCI) datasets. Finally, the proposed method is applied in the production capacity prediction and energy-saving of ethylene production systems and Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) production systems. The experimental results show the proposed method could reduce the number of hidden layer nodes and improve the training time of the ELM. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy of the ethylene production and the PTA production reaches about 99% to improve the energy efficiency of complex chemical processes.

AB  - Background
Lung cancer screening can reduce cancer mortality. Most implementation studies focus only on low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and clinical attributes of screening and do not include preferences of potential participants. In this study we evaluated the perceived value of screening programs based on LDCT, breath analysis (BA), or blood biomarkers (BB) according to the perspective of the target population.
Methods
A multi-criteria decision analysis framework was adopted. The weights of seven attributes of screening (sensitivity, specificity, radiation burden, duration of screening process, waiting time until results are communicated, location of screening, and mode of screening) were obtained from an earlier study that included a broad sample from the Netherlands. Performance data for the screening modalities was obtained from clinical trials and expert opinion. Parameter uncertainty about clinical performances was incorporated probabilistically, while heterogeneity in preferences was analyzed through subgroup analyses.
Results
The mean overall values were 0.58 (CI: 0.57 to 0.59), 0.57 (CI: 0.56 to 0.59), and 0.44 (CI: 0.43 to 0.45) for BB, BA, and LDCT, respectively. Seventy-seven per cent of respondents preferred BB or BA. For most subgroups, the overall values were similar to those of the entire sample. BA had the highest value for respondents who would have been eligible for earlier screening trials.
Discussion
BB and BA seem valuable to participants because they can be applied in a primary care setting. Although LDCT still seems preferable given its strong and positive evidence base, it is important to take non-clinical attributes into account to maximize attendance.

AB  - Worldwide, the residential buildings are consuming a considerable amount of energy. The high potential of buildings towards energy efficiency has drawn special attention to the passive design parameters. A comprehensive study on optimal passive design for residential buildings is presented in this paper. Twenty-five different climates are simulated with the aim to produce best practices to reduce building energy demands (for cooling and heating) in addition to the life-cycle cost (LCC). The occupants' adaptive thermal comfort is also improved by implementing the appropriate passive cooling strategies such as blinds and natural ventilation. In this respect, the implemented methodology is composed of four phases: building energy simulation, optimization, Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM), sensitivity study, and finally an adaptive comfort analysis. An optimal passive solution of the studied building indicates the potential to save up to 54%, 87% and 52% of the cooling demands (Qcool), heating demands (Qheat) and LCC respectively with respect to the initial configuration. The obtained optimal passive parameters are validated with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory NREL benchmark for low energy building's envelope. Additionally, the integrated passive cooling strategies have demonstrated its competency since it leads to a significant overheating decrease.

AB  - Understanding the affective needs of customers is crucial to the success of product design. Hybrid Kansei engineering system (HKES) is an expert system capable of generating products in accordance with the affective responses. HKES consists of two subsystems: forward Kansei engineering system (FKES) and backward Kansei engineering system (BKES). In previous studies, HKES was based primarily on single-objective optimization, such that only one optimal design was obtained in a given simulation run. The use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) in HKES was only attempted using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), such that very little work has been conducted to compare different MOEAs. In this paper, we propose an approach to HKES combining the methodologies of support vector regression (SVR) and MOEAs. In BKES, we constructed predictive models using SVR. In FKES, optimal design alternatives were generated using MOEAs. Representative designs were obtained using fuzzy c-means algorithm for clustering the Pareto front into groups. To enable comparison, we employed three typical MOEAs: NSGA-II, the Pareto envelope-based selection algorithm-II (PESA-II), and the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm-2 (SPEA2). A case study of vase form design was provided to demonstrate the proposed approach. Our results suggest that NSGA-II has good convergence performance and hybrid performance; in contrast, SPEA2 provides the strong diversity required by designers. The proposed HKES is applicable to a wide variety of product design problems, while providing creative design ideas through the exploration of numerous Pareto optimal solutions.

AB  - By establishing a network with related indices in urban system as nodes, urbanization quality can be defined as the structural features of the network. According to maximum information entropy principle (MIEP), structural parameter ξ of the index network and its dynamic equation have been derived. The dynamic equation can be calculated by self-organizing feature map (SOFM) artificial neural network algorithm in MATLAB platform. In this way, a new index network model (INM) of urbanization quality assessment (UQA) is constructed. The new INM is applied to the UQA of 37 major cities in China. Values of ξ quantitatively give the rank of the cities, which show that Shenzhen, Beijing and Suzhou have the highest quality scores more than 10 both in 2010 and 2014, reflecting much higher urbanization quality than other cities. The following cities are Xiamen, Tianjin, Nanjing, Hangzhou etc., then Chengdu, Zhengzhou, Shenyang and Tangshan etc. The quality scores of Guiyang, Kunming and Chongqing etc. are the lowest. With Xi’an and Wenzhou as sample cities, the contributions of each index to the urbanization quality are simultaneously revealed. Based on the structural parameter ξ of each mesoscope indexes derived from the new INM, we use the analysis method of factor contribution rate to reveal the contributions of each index to the urbanization quality. By recognizing the key factors, which influence the urbanization quality, the new INM can guide us take targeted measures for the improvement of urbanization quality. Beyond the application cases given, we finally state that the new INM is very universal and advantageous, which can be conveniently applied to the UQA of many other cities.

AB  - This article seeks to expand how conflict is classified in Evidence Theory, which is also known as Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST). Therefore, alternatives for classifying conflict under DST are discussed and a new approach is proposed based on the PROMETHEE method. To illustrate the use of this approach proposed, a numerical example from the literature on this topic is considered. The results obtained by comparing this proposal and the approach suggested in the literature indicate consistency in the classification. Thus, this novel approach enables the analysis of conflict in DST to be broadened to include decision-makers (DMs) who are more familiar with the structure of the PROMETHEE method. This method includes several intra-criteria preference functions and considers different thresholds within the scale. In addition to a new approach for classifying conflict under DST, this article proposes an adaptation to the disaggregation model based on linear programming in the literature, from which the parameters of the model can be generated using examples of conflict defined by the DM. The approach proposed uses this aggregated information from the DM and disaggregates it in order to define the parameters of the model, and results in a multicriteria analysis of conflict in Evidence Theory.

AB  - Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) has been widely considered a useful tool for evaluating decision making. Several derivatives of MCDA, including AHP, ANP, DANP, have been implemented in previous studies to construct real-world applications. However, literature combining a systematic introduction on methodological developments of MCDA with an empirical implementation in promoting technology through intermediaries is still rare. To fill in this gap, this paper begins with introducing the methodological development of MCDA to set out an analytical framework, namely DANP for the empirical analysis. Consequently, this paper applied DANP to analyze multiple determinants and five dimensions that we summarized from existing literature to find out the key determinants and the interdependent relationship for promoting the emerging sector through institutional intermediaries. While conducting empirical implementation, 33 experts from major intermediaries involved in promoting the biotechnology sector were visited. 7 out of 33 of these experts were further visited for interview to verify our analysis. Based on our MCDA analysis, we found that government policies and regulations are the most influential determinates while promoting emerging sectors through intermediaries. This paper contributes to the literature in several ways including highlighting methodological improvements of DANP, improving approaches on empirical data collection, and implementing an empirical MCDA analysis by applying an influential network relation map (INRM) to construct useful policy suggestions for real-world applications.

AB  - Project-based learning is based on the idea of iteratively learning for future projects from the successes and failures of past projects. This paper proposes a semi-automated implementation approach for double-loop learning in project environments. A combined application of two complementary methods is suggested for this purpose: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Analytic Network Process (ANP). By this means, the approach addresses two problems of the project management practice. First, the information overload in project environments, whereby the LSA is used for the semi-automated extraction of lessons learned from large collections of textual project documentation. Second, the lack of procedures and methods for the practical implementation of available project knowledge, whereby the ANP is used for the systematic modeling of extracted lessons learned and their integration into the evaluation of project concepts and current project management routines. Thus, the proposed implementation approach improves the ability of project-based organizations to consequently learn from past failures or successes. From a practical perspective, evident shortcomings of existing computerized double-loop learning approaches are addressed. The proposed approach contributes to the project management practice not only by demonstrating a solution for the exploration of representative and potentially new lessons from multiple combined experience reports, but also by presenting a solution for the systematic assessment of such project-governing variables and their mutual relationships as part of the decision-making in new projects. From a theoretical perspective, specific research avenues for further development of the double-loop learning concept by means of expert and intelligent systems are provided.

AB  - The evaluation of sustainability performance of a biomass supply chain is often compounded of a complex series of variables. The redundancies in variables often make the results become hard to be analysed and diagnosed. Therefore, principal component analysis (PCA) is introduced to reduce the redundancy of data series by converting a series of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated variables known as principal components (PCs), without losing too much information. However, the optimisation of PCs is relatively difficult as PCs encompass of convex combinations of original variables. In this paper, a novel PCA aided optimisation approach is introduced to solve the multi-echelon biomass supply chain problem (i.e., technology selection and transportation design), with the consideration of economic, environmental (including various impact categories and environmental footprints) and social (including health aspect, safety aspect and job creation) dimensions. On top of that, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to determine the priority scale assigned to each objective. The model is illustrated by using a case study in Johor, Malaysia. In this case study, the original 13 variables (indicators) had been successfully reduced to less than 3 PCs. Besides, the obtained results are benchmarked with two other conventional optimisation approaches, namely weighted-sum approach and max-min aggregation approach. The results show that PCA optimisation approach can provide reliable and comparable results (degree of satisfaction of the obtained results, λSCM are greater than 70%). In addition, sensitivity analysis is conducted to analyse the effect of relative priority of each objective on the technology selection and transportation design. This research is also expected to be useful for the big data (large volumes of extensively varied data that are generated and processed at high velocity) analysis in future supply chain management.

AB  - This study performed a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impact of chicken meat production from a Mexican case study, with a “cradle-to-slaughterhouse gate” approach. To overcome the LCA's limitations and provide a more holistic picture of the system, simulation and artificial intelligence techniques were integrated. First, raw material/energy requirements were obtained from the case study and simulated using Process simulation (PS) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation to estimate the emissions and quantify their uncertainty. Then, IMPACT 2002 + was used to calculate the overall impact using Ecoinvent and LCA Food databases. The results highlight that chicken farms are the main factors responsible for the environmental impacts assessed, where feed production (use of chemicals and energy requirements) and on-farm emissions (organic waste decomposition) are the main contributors. Concerning the slaughterhouse, the energy production (electricity and steam) and the cooling-related activities present a significant impact. Afterwards, three impact allocation procedures (mass method, neural networks, and stepwise regression) were tested, showing similar results. Finally, a multiobjective optimization model based on a Genetic Algorithm was applied looking to minimize the environmental impacts and maximize the economic benefits. The selected alternative achieved a reduction of 15.14% per functional unit at the environmental indicators. The results encourage the use of support techniques for LCA to perform a reliable assessment and an environmental/economic optimization of the system.

AB  - The most important environmental issues caused by the textile industry are intensive water consumption, high amounts of wastewater generation with significant pollutant loads. Previous studies were focused on minimization of water consumption and wastewater amounts in cotton textile finishing-dyeing. There are very few real-scale scientific studies about water efficiency in woolen textile production. In this study, it was aimed to reduce water consumption, wastewater amount and its pollutant loads by appropriate techno-economical minimization techniques in an integrated woolen textile mill. In this context, water consumptions and wastewater generations in basic and other auxiliary processes of the mill were examined by detailed on-site investigations. Process based specific water consumption and wastewater values were calculated. Additionally, water and wastewater samples were collected at different periods and analyzed. Specific pollutant loads of wastewater were also calculated. Thus, reuse potentials of the process wastewaters were evaluated. Moreover, saving and reduction potentials of the mill were determined by comparing with similar textile mills. Total of 82 minimization techniques were identified and evaluated by using multi-criteria decision-making methods. As a result, it was decided to implement 9 minimization techniques in the mill. Thus, reductions in water consumption by 41–69%, wastewater amounts by 48–75% and wastewater chemical loads by 28–63% can be achieved by the implementation of the minimization techniques. Potential payback period was ranged between 24 and 60 months. Employed methodology and findings of the study may be useful to similar textile mills, stakeholders and regulators. Presented results may also provide a road map to textile industry for cleaner production applications.

AB  - The concept of sustainability has become an essential theme for many industries and organisations due to a heightened sensitivity towards environmental protection and social responsibility. At the same time, firms still need to achieve economic viability and retain their competitive advantage. Because suppliers are the first entity and the initial source of any supply chain, organisations should select their suppliers by a careful evaluation of their critical success factors (CSF). Achieving a successful sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) strategy requires a firm to consider its stakeholders’ views. Based on the CSF theory and by considering the multi-stakeholders’ view in a sustainability perspective, this work provides a decision support system for the sustainable supplier selection (SSS) problem in a real world textile industry located in the emerging economy of India. Through a three-phase methodology, this study examines Indian suppliers by considering the sustainability views of various stakeholders, including employees, customers, researchers, shareholders, and a government environmental officer. The CSF priorities show that the first four influential CSFs are categorized as social concerns (i.e., maintaining long-term relationships and alliances, stakeholder empowerment, equity labour sources, and individual human rights). The fifth factor is an environmental issue (i.e., production of polluting agents). Among the five suppliers being evaluated in this work, Supplier 4 receives the top ranking. Specifically, the results show that the supplier rankings are highly influenced by CSF’s social dimensions. Hence, to validate the influence of CSF’s social dimensions in relation to the SSS process, a sensitivity analysis has been done by varying the respective weights. The study concludes with the relevant managerial implications and limitations.

AB  - Sustainable water resources management in arid and semi-arid areas needs robust models, which allow accurate and reliable predictive modeling. This issue has motivated the researchers to develop hybrid models that offer solutions on modelling problems and accurate predictions of groundwater potential zonation. For this purpose, this research aims to investigate the capability and robustness of a novel hybrid model, namely the logistic model tree (LMT) and compares it with state-of-the-art models such as the support vector machine and C4.5 models that locate potential zones for groundwater springs. A spring location dataset consisting of 359 springs was provided by field surveys and national reports and from which three different sample data sets (S1–S3) were randomly prepared (70% for training and 30% for validation). Additionally, 16 spring-related factors were analyzed using regression logistic analysis to find which factors play a significant role in spring occurrence. Twelve significant geo-environmental and morphometric factors were identified and applied in all models. The accuracy of models was evaluated by three different threshold-dependent and –Independent methods including efficiency (E), true skill statistic (TSS), and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC) methods. Results showed that the LMT model had the highest accuracy performance for all three validation datasets (Emean = 0.860, TSSmean = 0.718, AUC-ROCmean = 0.904); although a slight sensitivity to change in input data was sometimes observed for this model. Furthermore, the findings showed that relative slope position (RSP) was the most important factor followed by distance from faults and lithology.

AB  - Supplier selection is a strategic decision-making task for any company, as it engages multiple criteria for the evaluation and selection of alternate suppliers. So, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is a necessary approach in this domain. When both the qualitative and quantitative criteria are available and required to be evaluated simultaneously in decision making process for the supplier selection, a proper integrated approach is necessary to be adopted in order to select the best supplier and to find out the interrelationship structure within criteria. To address these issues, this paper proposes a unique integrated multi-attribute decision making (MADM) and mathematical programming (MP)-based model in a mixed environment (i.e., considering qualitative and quantitative criteria together) by combining decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)-based on analytic network process (ANP), i.e., DANP, fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution, i.e., FTOPSIS and multiple segment goal programming (MSGP). Network relationship map (NRM) is used to outline the interrelationships among the dimensions and criteria. The novelty of the proposed supplier selection approach lies with the fact that both the qualitative and quantitative criteria have been considered in it. Sensitivity analysis has also been carried out to validate the result of our proposed methodology. In addition, the result of our proposed method is supported by DANP-based fuzzy VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (FVIKOR) technique and the best supplier has been identified. Delivery schedule and environmental collaboration are revealed to be the most and least important dimensions, respectively.

AB  - Politico-economic deregulation, new communication technologies, and cheap transport have pushed companies to increasingly outsource business activities to geographically distant countries. Such outsourcing has often resulted in complex supply chain configurations. Because social and environmental regulations in those countries are often weak or poorly enforced, stakeholders impose responsibility on focal companies to ensure socially and environmentally sustainable production standards throughout their supply chains. In this paper, we present an integrated fuzzy AHP-VIKOR approach-based framework for sustainable global supplier selection that takes sustainability risks from sub-suppliers (i.e., (1+n)th-tier suppliers) into account. Sustainability criteria (including risk concerns) were identified from the existing literature and were further narrowed with the assistance of field experts and case decision makers to remove any literature bias. Then, based on the finalized sustainability criteria, suppliers and sub-suppliers were evaluated altogether. In previous studies, this approach was limited. The problem is addressed in two stages as follows. In the first stage, fuzzy AHP is used to generate criteria weights for sustainable global supplier selection, and in the second stage, fuzzy VIKOR is used to rate supplier performances against the evaluation criteria. Among five sustainability criteria (economic, quality, environment, social, and global risk), economic criteria demonstrated the greatest weight and global risk displayed the least weight. This result clearly shows that global risks are still not considered a major criterion for supplier selection. Further, the proposed framework may serve as a starting point for developing managerial decision-making tools to help companies more effectively address sustainability risks occurring further upstream in their supply chains. These vital tools are particularly important if focal companies are under intense scrutiny by their stakeholders.

AB  - The risk management framework includes the practice of keeping safety stocks and safety lead time buffers. However, in today's high-tech and highly globalized world where competition is so fierce and paramount that managing and mitigating the risk by creating a more resilient supply chain has become indispensable for any organization. Assessing and managing the supply chain risks become very important in this context and one such risk assessing tool is Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). AHP supports managers in identifying the risk indicators, assessing the impact of undesired events and the varied cause and effect relationships along the chain, and thus prioritizing the objectives of the supply chain, hence arriving at the selection of the best supplier from various alternatives. Thus, the objective of this paper is to identify and assess supply chain risk across multiple product categories using cognitive maps and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology.

The collaborative filtering is wide as the recommendation tool in the majority of the commercial recommenders. However, the outcome of collaborative filtering is often jeopardized by the sparsity, cold start, and grey sheep problems. To solve these issues in a more efficient way, a novel collaborative filtering algorithm entitled as Altered Client-based Collaborative Filtering (ACCF) for group recommendation is proposed. ACCF employs Dragonfly Algorithm to deal with the sparsity and neighbor selection. Restaurant recommendation system is utilized as a test bed for the validation of ACCF. With the end goal of performance assessment, a comparative study has been incorporated that depicts the proposed algorithm successfully minimizes the sparsity problem. The experimental outcome rendering ACCF provides 37%, 59%, 53% more Coverage, Precision and F-Measure than the user-based collaborative filtering even applicable for a small sample of data.

AB  - Maintenance scheduling for naval vessels and ships requires ongoing improvement to manage rising maintenance costs within availability constraints. Existing maintenance scheduling approaches are not optimal as maintenance costs continue to rise without an improvement in vessel availability. This paper reviews the Risk-Based Maintenance Scheduling (RBM) framework as applied to ships and naval vessels, and provides a critical analysis of Risk Assessment and Maintenance Scheduling techniques used. Further, objectives and considerations are defined for future applications for ships and naval vessels, and the framework evaluated as an improvement on existing Preventative Maintenance (PM) and Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) methods. A probabilistic approach supported by condition monitoring data in combination with Decision Theory is suggested for the Risk Assessment and Maintenance Scheduling elements comprising an RBM Scheduling framework. Implementation of this framework from both periodic PM and RCM is presented. Development of applications from the component level upwards is suggested. Availability and overall maintenance cost are suggested as evaluation metrics against existing methods. The development of an application is formalized within a proposed framework. The development of an application within the RBM Scheduling framework is expected to result in reduced maintenance costs while meeting availability requirements for ship and naval vessel applications.

AB  - Better Life Index (BLI), the measure of well-being proposed by the OECD, contains many metrics, which enable it to include a detailed overview of the social, economic, and environmental performances of different countries. However, this also increases the difficulty in evaluating the big picture. In order to overcome this, many composite BLI procedures have been proposed, but none of them takes into account societal priorities in the aggregation. One of the reasons for this is that at the moment there is no representative survey about the relative priorities of the BLI topics for each country. Using these priorities could help to design Composite Indices that better reflect the needs of the people. The largest collection of information about society is found in social media such as Twitter. This paper proposes a composite BLI based on the weighted average of the national performances in each dimension of the BLI, using the relative importance that the topics have on Twitter as weights. The idea is that the aggregate of millions of tweets may provide a representation of the priorities (the relative appreciations) among the eleven topics of the BLI, both at a general level and at a country-specific level. By combining topic performances and related Twitter trends, we produce new evidences about the relations between people's priorities and policy makers' activity in the BLI framework.

AB  - The strategic location of manufacturing plants and warehouses and the allocation of resources to the various stages of a supply chain using big data is of paramount importance in the era of internet of things. A multi-objective mathematical model is formulated in this paper to solve a location-allocation problem in a multi-echelon supply chain network to optimize three objectives simultaneously such as minimization of total supply chain cost (TSCC), maximization of fill rate and minimization of CO2 emissions. Data driven hybrid evolutionary analytical approach is proposed by integrating Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to handle multiple objectives into Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. Five variants of the hybrid algorithm are evaluated in addition to comparing the performance with the existing Multi-Objective Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (MOHPSO) algorithm. Extensive computational experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed Data driven hybrid evolutionary analytical approach over the existing MOHPSO algorithm. This study identifies a specific variant that is capable of producing the best solution in a higher order simulated instances and complex realistic scenario such as an automotive electronic parts supply chain in Malaysia.

AB  - Along with the convenience provided by the open online social networks (OSNs) for the users, there are also many burning problems like insecure platform, untrustworthy information, malicious propagation, even illegal cheating. Especially, security and trustworthiness of social platforms, as the foundation of social interactions, plays an important role in active users’ sharing and communication. The available research efforts of the aspects mainly focus on exploring security mechanisms and methods, as well as establishing trust relationship among social users. However, the evaluation and measurement for social platforms have not yet been well conducted. This paper proposed a novel method for crowd evaluating the security and trustworthiness of OSNs platforms based on signaling theory, which have been generally employed in the fields of economics and information management. Firstly, we classified the security and trust-critical signals of generic OSNs platform itself, and formalized static attributes and dynamic behaviors features by using the OWL and the temporal logic. Then, a comprehensive computational model for security and trustworthiness measurement was proposed inspired by crowd computing, after signals’ weights were yielded based on Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process Comprehensive Evaluation. Finally, the evaluation experiments were carried out by using crowd evaluation architecture on a real-world multimedia social network platform called CyVOD MSN. The experimental results denote that the proposed approach can effectively achieve the assessments of every security and trust-critical signals of the social platforms, and further realize the functional evolution of CyVOD MSN through improving insecure and untrustworthy vulnerabilities found by the crowd evaluation.

AB  - Industry 4.0 is a trend related to smart factories, which are cyber-physical spaces populated and controlled by the collective intelligence for the autonomous and highly flexible manufacturing purposes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) embedded into various planning, production, and management processes in Industry 4.0 must take the initiative and responsibility for making necessary real-time decisions in many cases. In this paper, we suggest the Pi-Mind technology as a compromise between completely human-expert-driven decision-making and AI-driven decision-making. Pi-Mind enables capturing, cloning and patenting essential parameters of the decision models from a particular human expert making these models transparent, proactive and capable of autonomic and fast decision-making simultaneously in many places. The technology facilitates the human impact (due to ubiquitous presence) in smart manufacturing processes and enables human-AI shared responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made. It also benefits from capturing and utilization of the traditionally human creative cognitive capabilities (sometimes intuitive and emotional), which in many cases outperform the rational decision-making. Pi-Mind technology is a set of models, techniques, and tools built on principles of value-based biased decision-making and creative cognitive computing to augment the axioms of decision rationality in industry.

AB  - China consumes more energy and emits more carbon dioxide than any other country. The building sector accounts for nearly 1/3 of the total national energy consumption in China; thus, it is critical to find a solution for improving buildings’ energy efficiency. Under the market-oriented mechanism, constrained by the energy performance contracting (EPC) mode, energy service companies (ESCOs) play an important role in improving energy efficiency for high-energy-consumption industries, including the building sector. The aim of this study is to determine the strategy for boosting the building ESCO industry. By conducting a strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) analysis, this paper presented the status of the building ESCO industry in China and proposed alternative strategies. By utilizing a conventional multi-criteria decision-making method, namely, the Analytic Network Process (ANP), this study provides a quantitative basis to analytically determine the ranking of the factors in SWOT analysis and select the best strategy to promote the development of the building ESCO industry. The results showed that the ANP-SWOT is a viable and highly capable methodology that provides invaluable insights for strategic management decisions in the building ESCO industry, and a set of strategies for promoting ESCO development in the building sector were proposed based on this approach.

AB  - In the current study, the techno-environmental and economic feasibility analysis was conducted for prospective wind power plants in North West Iran. In order to assess the most appropriate and prospective wind farms, a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique in ArcGIS was used by applying the most important and effective environmental and technical criteria in the study area. Then, the obtained areas were classified on the basis of International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) turbine classes using the wind speed map of the country to select the most appropriate wind turbine technology. The Weibull function was applied to model the wind behavior using actual meteorological data. The best fitted Weibull parameters including shape factor and mean wind speed were used in System Advisor Model (SAM) software to calculate the capacity factor for the three most promising regions of the study area at three different mast heights. The results indicated that around 9116 km2 was available as suitable area for wind turbine class III power plant implementation. Turbine Vestas V47 was chosen in order to estimate the amount of annual output energy, according to the achieved capacity factors condition. The total potential of annual generation was estimated to be 11,180.17 GWh, which can cover the majority of energy demand in the area. Finally, economic evaluation for this turbine showed that the generated power cost is around 0.15 $/kWh (4350 IRR/kWh). In the last step of this study, the amount of greenhouse gases reduction was calculated for each site.

The purpose of the present investigation is to identify and model the critical challenges to sustainable development in the textile and apparel sector. With this view, fourteen critical challenges to the sustainable development of the case sector were identified through literature and expert opinion survey, and their cause–effect relationship was established using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. Results of the study highlighted that a lack of effective governmental policies and poor infrastructure were the most significant barriers demanding the maximum attention of the decision-makers for achieving sustainability in the case sector. The findings of the study are intended to guide the decision and policy-makers in understanding the influence of barriers to the sustainable development of the case sector, and for developing new strategies/policies or modifying the existing ones. Also, a few significant recommendations have been provided for improving the overall performance of the case supply chain.

AB  - There are many tools, models, and algorithms to aid in the selection of appropriate trenchless methods for pipeline installation or rehabilitation. However, one key concern is which method or technique provides optimum solution to the rehabilitation of multiple pipe segments rather than just a single pipe segment. Therefore, the searching criterion for an optimum decision support system is divided into two parts. First, the selection of the optimum method capable of solving the problem properly. Second, a simultaneous analysis of other parameters such as cost, time, and quality to improve the overall benefits of the project. It is observed that most of the real-world cases involves multiple segments in a single project. Therefore, an optimization of the solution must be made for those multiple pipe segments. Although use of different methods for each segment is a preferable solution, it may not be feasible in a wider consideration of project cost, quality, and time. Hence, one way to determine the optimal solution for multiple line segments is to minimize the number of methods and their anticipated total costs which include direct costs and social costs. This paper presents a mathematical approach to expedite the optimum solution by evaluating all of the trenchless technology methods capable of installing, replacing, or rehabilitating each pipe segment (a solution set) and minimizing the number of methods and their total costs.

KW  - Bag-representative selection
AB  - Multiple-instance learning (MIL) is a variation of supervised learning, where samples are represented by labeled bags, each containing sets of instances. The individual labels of the instances within a bag are unknown, and labels are assigned based on a multi-instance assumption. One of the major complexities associated with this type of learning is the ambiguous relationship between a bag’s label and the instances it contains. This paper proposes a novel support vector machine (SVM) multiple-instance formulation and presents an algorithm with a bag-representative selector that trains the SVM based on bag-level information, named MIRSVM. The contribution is able to identify instances that highly impact classification, i.e. bag-representatives, for both positive and negative bags, while finding the optimal class separation hyperplane. Unlike other multi-instance SVM methods, this approach eliminates possible class imbalance issues by allowing both positive and negative bags to have at most one representative, which constitute as the most contributing instances to the model. The experimental study evaluates and compares the performance of this proposal against 11 state-of-the-art multi-instance methods over 15 datasets, and the results are validated through non-parametric statistical analysis. The results indicate that bag-based learners outperform the instance-based and wrapper methods, as well as MIRSVM’s overall superior performance against other multi-instance SVM models, having an average accuracy of 82.6%, which is 2.5% better than the best performing state-of-the-art MI classifier.

AB  - Many factors, including improper maintenance and material aging, may lead to the occurrence of defects during the operation of the various functions of buildings. Building defect information is normally stored in a discrete and unstructured way, and for this reason, building a case-based reasoning framework regarding building defects to enhance the level of building maintenance management has become an important field in the related research. At present, there is limited research available on the integration of geometric data models that are built by means of scanning and multi-attribute selection strategies. This study proposes an integrated information management framework for superficial defects in buildings, which is compatible with a point clouds model as a central data source. It features the attributes of defects used in multi-criteria decision analysis. A CBR (case-based reasoning) approach that considers case-based distance is used to enhance the performance of similarity calculations and case retrieval. A case-based distance model is utilized for the data processing stage and concentrates on a smaller case set that contains best alternatives. The potential benefit offered by this approach is that more efficient results can be obtained from classified cases during the retrieval phase process. A comparison of a CBR query with ungrouped sample data is performed to establish patterns to verify the effectiveness of the calculation method of determining case similarity, which is supported by the pre-processing of classified information about the building defects. The analytical results show that the proposed method performs well in solving the multi-attribute classification of building defects and avoiding ambiguous answers retrieved from unrelated subsets. This approach might be capable of investigating the practical problems involved in building maintenance in the AEC domains.

AB  - The paper develops and operationalises a supply chain risk network management (SCRNM) process that captures interdependencies between risks, multiple (potentially conflicting) performance measures and risk mitigation strategies within a (risk) network setting. The process helps in prioritising risks and strategies specific to the decision maker's risk appetite. The process is demonstrated through a case study conducted in a global manufacturing supply chain involving semi-structured interviews and focus group sessions with experts in risk management. Theoretically grounded in the framework of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) and Expected Utility Theory (EUT), the modelling approach has a number of distinctive characteristics. It utilises a top-down approach of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Performance measures are identified first and subsequently connected to risks. A ‘probability-conditional expected utility’ matrix is introduced to reflect the propagation impact of interdependent risks on all performance measures identified. A ‘weighted net evaluation of risk mitigation’ method is proposed and the method of ‘swing weights’ is used to capture the trade-off between the efficacy of strategies and the associated cost keeping in view the decision maker's risk appetite. The approach adapts and integrates techniques from safety and reliability engineering (FTA), decision making under uncertainty (EUT), and multi-criteria decision analysis (swing weights). The merits and challenges associated with the implementation of interdependency based frameworks are discussed. Propositions are presented to elucidate the significance of modelling interdependency between risks and strategies.

Before AHP application, the amount of input data is decreased with cluster analysis. The first run of AHP is aimed to rank the clustered analytical procedures, while the second analysis is performed to select the best procedure from the cluster with the highest rank obtained in the first AHP run. The procedure based on a direct sample injection to high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection is the most beneficial one. AHP is excellent tool for the assessment and the selection of the most appropriate analytical procedure from several available. The choice of MCDA method is dictated by the fact, that so far, no examples of the usage of a given method for the selection of the optimal analytical procedure have been found in the literature.

The supplier segments are represented through a 2 × 4 matrix (8 quadrants) with the cost of products on the x-axis (Low/High), supply risk on the y-axis (Low/High) and sustainability impact on the z-axis (Low/High). We assess sustainability risk for four supplier segments representing a High impact on sustainability and allow the evaluation of economic, environmental and social risks internal and external to the supplier permitting the integration of multiple stakeholders. The framework simplifies the cognitive effort of decision makers when selecting a portfolio of suppliers. It provides an assessment of the level of hazardousness, vulnerability and implementation of risk management practices relevant to each supplier segment and enables long-term partnerships by the consideration of risk monitoring and mitigation when necessary. The SSRAF was applied to real data collected from a global manufacturer of consumer products with operations in Mexico.

AB  - Measurement uncertainty is a key component in the overall uncertainty calculation for Measurement and Verification (M&V) projects. However, in some cases, it is reduced to outlier detection or basic uncertainty propagation calculations. In other cases, funds are spent on determining uncertainties that have little effect on project decisions. Therefore a need exists for a fuller treatment of the subject in the light of literature from M&V and other fields. This paper surveys general M&V literature, as well as relevant research from metrology, electrical engineering, economics, decision analysis, and statistics. Electrical metering and sub-metering uncertainty is investigated, as well as often-overlooked considerations such as power quality and the cost of calibration. The effect of mismeasurement on energy models and practical techniques for mitigating such effects are assessed. Last, research on building simulation and project decisions in the light of measurement error is surveyed. Bayesian methods are found to be a recurring theme in much of the research being conducted on all of these aspects. Power quality and mismeasurement effects have also been found to make a material difference in project evaluation. The survey is concluded with recommendations for further research in the light of current trends in data analysis and energy evaluation.

AB  - The past few years have seen dramatic development and a great interest in efficient service delivery and better resource utilization in the Internet of Things (IoT) based constrained Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The IoT is mainly dependent on optimal deployment of energy aware WSN and efficient communication architecture for data transfer among heterogeneous devices. In addition, energy efficient clustering techniques for WSN node deployment and routing have achieved great involvement for prolonging network lifetime. In clustering technique, where the network is partitioned into different segments (clusters or zones) and proper attention must be given to the cluster head (CH) selection procedure for maximizing node reachability inside the cluster and efficient communication to the base station. In this paper, we have proposed multi-criteria based cluster head/zone head selection scheme in Internet of Things based WSN by considering distinct parameters affecting node energy and network lifetime. These parameters; energy level, distance from neighboring nodes, distance from center of the zone, number of times a node has been zone head and whether a node is merged or not, have direct impact on overall performance of WSN. The relative impact of each parameter in CH/ZH selection is computed using the Analytical Network Process (ANP) which is widely used multi-criteria decision tool. Simulation results of the proposed scheme show relatively better performance than existing energy efficient clustering techniques. The obtained results have been analyzed by varying the number of parameters in ZH selection and their impact on network stability and lifetime.

AB  - In recent years, with the rapid economic growth, the electric power consumption has led to a continuous increase. Besides, to adapt to the new supply and demand relationships, industrial structure has changed dramatically, and electricity consumption in different industries has changed accordingly, such as in Hebei province that boasts a large amount of traditional industries. Hence, the study of the change of electricity consumption in different industries and the correlation between them have great practical significance for monitoring changes in macroeconomic structure and aiding decision-making in power companies. This paper selected a typical county in Hebei Province and used the method of complex network and sensitive coefficient to analyze the correlation of electricity load among different industries. This paper found that the industrial structure in Bazhou county show a strong relationship with the traditional industry classification. The correlation between each industry in the same traditional industry is stronger and more stable, and it is weaker and more changeable regarding different traditional industries.

AB  - The traditional supply chains faces several challenges such as uncertainty, cost, complexity and vulnerable problems. To overcome these problems the supply chains must be more smarter. For establishing a large-scale of smart infrastructure to merge data, information, products, physical objects and all processes of supply chain, we applies the internet of things (IOT) in supply chain management (SCM) through building a smart and secure system of SCM. We have prepared a website for suppliers and managers. We tracked the flow of products at each stage in supply chain management through the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Each product attached with RFID tag and scanned through RFID reader and ESP8266 at each phase of supply chain management. After scanning the tag we stores tag id in the database. All information about products will be entered by suppliers and then uploaded to managers. In our system the supplier and manager gets perfect information of the entire life cycle of goods, and this will achieve transparency of supply chain management. For assessing security criteria of proposed system of supply chain management, we also proposed a framework which integrates neutrosophic Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique with analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The neutrosophic Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique is utilized to infer cause and effect interrelationships among criteria of smart supply chain security requirements. Depending on obtained information from (N-DEMATEL) the neutrosophic AHP is utilized to calculate weight of criteria and sub-criteria. Then the integrated framework will help researchers and practitioners to design secure system of supply chains. We presented DEMATEL and AHP in neutrosophic environment to deal effectively with vague, uncertain and incomplete information. So the proposed system of supply chain management will be able to overcome all challenges of traditional SCM and provide secure environment of SCM processes.

AB  - Cluster ensembles have been shown to be better than any standard clustering algorithm at improving accuracy and robustness across different data collections. This meta-learning formalism also helps users to overcome the dilemma of selecting an appropriate technique and the corresponding parameters, given a set of data to be investigated. Almost two decades after the first publication of a kind, the method has proven effective for many problem domains, especially microarray data analysis and its down-streaming applications. Recently, it has been greatly extended both in terms of theoretical modelling and deployment to problem solving. The survey attempts to match this emerging attention with the provision of fundamental basis and theoretical details of state-of-the-art methods found in the present literature. It yields the ranges of ensemble generation strategies, summarization and representation of ensemble members, as well as the topic of consensus clustering. This review also includes different applications and extensions of cluster ensemble, with several research issues and challenges being highlighted.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to provide a structured overview of the value of information in different supply chain decisions and to identify a research agenda based on the current state of research on the topic. The paper uses the systematic literature review methodology to review journal articles published in the 12-year period from 2006 to 2017. Each selected study is analyzed using a rigorous review framework of four primary dimensions, including “supply chain decisions”, “information”, “modelling approach”, and “context”. The review of articles shows that the current literature is rich in assessing the value of information in inventory decisions, yet insufficient in other supply chain areas such as facility, transportation, sourcing, and pricing. In addition, the value of information is subject to contextual supply chain parameters and varies in accordance with the characteristics of the information (such as accuracy, timeliness, and completeness). Furthermore, the focus of the existing literature is on “information availability” in supply chain decisions, and the impact of important information characteristics on the value of information has not been studied extensively. The research on information timeliness and its influence on supply chain performance is especially limited. Based on the discussion and results of our review, a research agenda is offered and sample research questions are discussed.

The application that motivated these methodological developments is also described, consisting of an assessment of policies to foster technological innovations in the electricity sector, namely in a context of evolution to smart grids. Qualitative assessments were elicited from 28 experts using a Delphi process. The assessments concern the impact of policies on different objectives, but also opinions concerning the importance of these objectives. These opinions are translated into constraints on the weights of the corresponding criteria, in a partial information setting. Then, policies are sorted into categories based on a stochastic multi-criteria analysis for the ELECTRE TRI method. A new ranking approach is also developed to be compatible with the sorting results, based on a robustness analysis of ELECTRE TRI credibility indices. Results are discussed considering the entire set of experts and considering subsets of experts representing different perspectives.

AB  - Rotomoulding is an emerging industry of present era for manufacturing hollow plastic products of various sizes. Different materials like polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinylchloride, polycarbonate etc. are used in rotational moulding. As vast variety of materials with diverse physical and mechanical characteristics is available, choosing the best suitable material becomes a challenge. Rotomoulder has to take into account a large number of material selection criteria before arriving at the final decision, otherwise there may be premature failure of the product during its operation. In order to assist the rotomoulder, this paper presents a systematic and efficient multi attribute decision-making approach referred as grey relation analysis for material selection in rotational moulding. In order to elaborate the above said procedure eleven alternatives are evaluated against seven criteria. From the analysis suitable material has been identified.

AB  - Mathematical modeling and simulation methods are important tools in studying various processes in science and engineering. In the current review, we focus on the applications of hybrid models (HMs) in chemical processes, oil and gas processes, and applied energy systems. These processes suffer from complexities that demand advanced mathematical tools to be employed for various purposes such as process development, identification, simulation and modeling, optimization, control, classification, clustering, forecasting, and monitoring. Beside the lack of adequate knowledge about the processes related to the chemical and energy systems, there are other mathematical complexities such as non-linearity, large and multi-scale, long dynamics, uncertainties, and high dimensionality. The HMs can provide a practical solution to such complex processes. The arrangements of different black-box models with themselves or with white-box models are alternatively used to reduce the model complexities. The hybrid gray-box models are of significant importance as they combine the physical significance and generalization capabilities of the white-box models with the complexity reduction capability of the black-box models to facilitate/enhance the modeling strategy, while a desired precision is targeted. Such a hybridized model enables the physically-meaningful computation for the time-demanding applications. In this paper, we review different sub-models, hybridization strategies, structural designs, screening criteria, and new directions in hybrid modeling, with focus on the corresponding applications in chemical, petroleum, and energy systems.

AB  - In the past few decades, an interest in reverse logistics has attracted the attention of industries and also has become a subject of interest for researchers. However, while reverse logistics is becoming a mandatory element of the supply chain in developed countries particularly due to legislation issues, the subject is still in a state of infancy in emerging economies such as Brazil. In these connections, impediments to reverse logistics implementation must be considered and analyzed, as well as the many different perspectives from the key stakeholders for their development. The objective of this research is to evaluate the interrelationship among reverse logistics barriers from the perspectives of the most important stakeholders in the Brazilian context. For this purpose, a Multi-Criteria Decision Making tool named grey-based Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (grey-DEMATEL) was used to extract a multiple company-customer-government association perspective. Three respondents – one expert from each stakeholder – have been consulted to obtain the pair-wise comparison of barriers. Thus, both the net effect and the importance level of each impediment are provided by means of a Euclidean distance analysis, as well as the similarities and differences among stakeholders’ opinions. The uniqueness of this paper relies on the fact that no previous work was found in the domain of multiple stakeholders’ perspective for reverse logistics barriers. This research uncovers that most of the key barriers from the reverse logistics multiple perspectives framework are from the organizational point of view. This stakeholder holds 10 out of 13 key barriers for RL implementation; as such, it is an important outcome because it indicates that firms may begin product return implementation by first tackling key internal barriers. Moreover, knowing the influential factors in their environment may assist industry managers to better implement and manage reverse flows, and to see through current and future green solutions for reverse logistics.

AB  - How to implement the strategy of joint prevention and control of air pollution (JPCAP) to effectively control the severe regional air pollution has become a focus of global concern. Chinese government has adopted this strategy widely, but it is improving the regional air quality too slowly and costly because of lacking accurate scopes and priorities of JPCAP regions. In this context, making use of long-term, wide-area monitoring data provided by the constantly expanding air pollution monitoring network, we proposed new methods to solve these problems, including (i) the method of subdividing large regions into sub-regions by using data-mining technologies and (ii) the method of determining the priorities for JPCAP sub-regions based on the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution method (TOPSIS) by establishing four key indicators. To test the methods, we applied them to a case study of JPCAP for particulates smaller than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) in 15 cities of the Yangtze River Delta, China. We found that the region under study could be subdivided into four JPCAP sub-regions for PM2.5 and nine for O3. The priorities assigned to these sub-regions match their actual conditions in terms of population density, industrial structure, geographic features, and climate, suggesting that the new methods are scientific and effective. Thus, implementation of the new methods should help to mitigate regional pollution problems both in China and around the world.

In order to assist the short-term policy making for the development of critical LCTs in China, an evaluation of the performance of low carbon technologies (LCTs) for the top three energy-intensive industries in China is conducted in this paper through multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. There are 31 LCTs identified for these three industries based on the criteria including environmental performance, technological performance, and economic performance. Based on the experts’ evaluation, top 10 LCTs are selected as the critical LCTs which should be given priority in the short-term technology diffusion in China. Suggestions are provided for policy-makers on the carbon mitigation and cleaner production in the main energy-intensive industries in China.

AB  - Supplier selection as a multi-criteria decision-making problem that highly depends on the decision makers’ vision has a major issue among supply chain (SC) managers. SC sustainability, which pays attention to the environmental, economic, and social aspects in SC, has been recently highlighted in the evaluation process undergone by the SC managers. Suppliers, as the basic components of the SC, play a significant role in creating a sustainable SC. Hence, the first aim of this research is to determine the weights of sustainability criteria by using analytical hierarchy process. The second aim of this study is to evaluate suppliers based on four main criteria, CO2 emissions, the number of employees in the suppliers’ country industry, water consumption and distance from supplier's country to the destination at three SC levels and the macroeconomic (international) level. In order to address the second goal of this research, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method as a multi-criteria decision-making method has been applied. In this research, Iran's steel industry has been selected as the case study. Results show that the Iranian mining industry is the best sustainable supplier for Iran's steel industry. In addition, Iran was found as the best sustainable supplier country for most suppliers in Iran's steel industry SC based on the three SC sustainability criteria at three levels. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been applied according to the different weights of the sustainability criteria. The results of this research can help managers in the steel industry to deal with the supplier selection problem at the macro-level. Furthermore, the presented approach in this research can assist managers of other industries to select and evaluate their suppliers.

AB  - The present study establishes a robust combination forecasting model and achieves the accurate prediction of electrical load by considering the dependency of the load series and the meteorological factors. On this basis, the culture particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed to improve the accuracy of the forecast. The merit is that by the particle mutation strategy, parameter adjustment strategy dependent on the fitness and the knowledge updating strategy, particles are avoided to trap in local optimum, consequently improving the computational speed and performance. Moreover, the data preprocessing technology based on the EEMD is proposed to reduce the random noises of the load series and to improve the robust of the forecasting model. The anomaly detection model is proposed in view of the probability distribution of relative errors. To assess the applicability and accuracy of the proposed model, it is compared with ant colony optimization, genetic algorithm, simulated annealing approach, cuckoo search algorithm, differential evaluation and artificial cooperative search. Results validated by the actual data sets for Shaanxi province, China, show higher accuracy and better reliability of the proposed model in comparison with other optimization models.

The model is a first step in the development of multi-parametric assessment that aims to bridge the existing mismatch between professional visual based assessment and objective measurement and objective indices. One of the perceived reasons for this is that the objective indices are applied to plane projections, i.e. 3D characteristics are inferred from partial 2D information. Hence a modified index using 3D scan data was developed and assessed. Based on this single index and statistical analysis, population result matched closely reported values by professional assessors. The overlap, i.e. type 1 and type 2 errors, were reduced but still require further refinement. The next step in the artificial intelligence type multi-criteria decision making is to utilize the Gaussian curve at a global shape level using ellipsoids for shape characterization. The work on this is still in progress as key characteristics for image reconstruction need to be finalized as well as the degree of complexity of the shape approximation.

This study sought to propose a model for assessing and ranking foreign companies willing to take an active part in the Iranian petrochemical industry. To accomplish this, an integrated model composed of Best-Worst Method, ELECTRE III and PROMETHEE II was proposed. More specifically, to weight the criteria, Best-Worst Method was used, and to evaluate and rank them, ELECTRE and PROMETHEE methods were utilized. The data were gathered through questionnaires which collected the opinions of 8 experts in the field of the Iranian petrochemical industry. Results of data analysis revealed that in final evaluation, some well-known European companies in this area had higher positions compared to the others and those which cooperated with Iran during the sanctions.

AB  - In a real-world loading case (e.g., car crash accidents), energy-absorbing components are subject to oblique loads at various uncertain angles. This paper aims to investigate the behavior of such components under three-dimensional (3D) oblique loads in deterministic and probabilistic loading conditions. In this way, some square tubes are tested experimentally, and results are utilized to validate numerical models. To apply the 3D oblique load, a special test setup is designed, constructed, and installed on a universal tensile testing machine. Hammersley method is employed to design sample points. ABAQUS software is used for the finite element modeling and analysis. GEvoM software is implemented for mapping design variables onto crashworthiness characteristics including energy absorption (EA) and peak crush force (PCF). Both deterministic and reliability-based robust design (RBRD) optimizations are performed, and their results are compared with each other. The primary outcome of this research is the effect of incidence angles on the energy-absorbing characteristics, as well as some remarkable trade-off design points obtained from various multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. It was discovered that the obtained design points of probabilistic study, which satisfied the reliability constraint, were roughly 60% more robust than deterministic points.

AB  - To monitor and control interrupted flow at signalized intersections, several Traffic Signal Control Systems (TSCSs) were developed based on optimization and artificial intelligence techniques. Although learning can provide intelligent ways to deal with disturbances, existing approaches still lack concepts and mechanisms that enable direct representation of knowledge and explicit learning, particularly to capture and reuse previous experiences with disturbances. This article addresses this gap by designing a new TSCS based on innovative concepts and mechanisms borrowed from biological immunity. Immune memory enables the design of a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) System in which cases provide a direct representation of knowledge about disturbances. Immune network theory enables the design of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) mechanism to interconnect cases, capture explicit knowledge about the outcomes (success and failure) of control decisions and enable decision-making by taking advantage of previous outcomes in reaction to new occurrences of disturbances. We provide a detailed description of new learning algorithms, both to create the case-base and to interconnect cases using RL. The performance of the suggested TSCS is assessed by benchmarking it against two standard control strategies from the literature, namely fixed-time and adaptive control using the Longest Queue First – Maximal Weight Matching (LQF-MWM) algorithm. The suggested TSCS is applied on an intersection simulated using VISSIM, a state-of-the-art traffic simulation software. The results show that the suggested TSCS is able to handle different traffic scenarios with competitive performance, and that it is recommended for extreme situations involving blocked approaches and high traffic flow.

AB  - This paper describes an application of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) for multi-modal fusion of features in a 3D face recognition system. A decision making process is outlined that is based on the performance of multi-modal features in a face recognition task involving a set of 3D face databases. In particular, the fuzzy interval valued MCDM technique called TOPSIS is applied for ranking and deciding on the best choice of multi-modal features at the decision stage. It provides a formal mechanism of benchmarking their performances against a set of criteria. The technique demonstrates its ability in scaling up the multi-modal features.

AB  - This paper presents a new decision-making solution based multi-measurement design parameter for GPS baseband receiver tracking channel selection in static and dynamic real-time positioning multipath scenarios. The novelty claim is the use of evaluation design parameter matrix (EDPM) to measure and rank the overall performance of tracking channel selection. However, the major problems with the evaluation of different operation modes of the GPS receiver include finding reasonable thresholds to select the number of GPS baseband receiver tracking channels that can balance the trade-off between conflicted GPS design parameters and determining the optimum GPS baseband receiver tracking channels in terms of power consumption and localisation accuracy. A practical study that included multipath environment was performed based on static and dynamic real-time positioning. A total of nine different operating modes of GPS receiver are evaluated by each design parameter, namely power consumption, localisation accuracy and time with no position available in multipath scenarios. All the results for positioning scenarios given these parameters are gathered in one platform such as EDPM. Subsequently, the number of tracking channels was scored based on EDPM using multi-criteria decision-making techniques, such as integrated analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS); these solutions are from different contexts (e.g., individual and group). The systematic ranking of the static and dynamic scenarios is presented to three experts for subjective judgment to validate the experimental results. Findings of this research in static and dynamic positioning are as follows. (1) Systematically, the integration of TOPSIS and AHP is effective for solving the conflict between GPS design parameters and determining the optimum GPS baseband receiver tracking channel problems. (2) Individual context shows variances among expert ranking. (3) Internal and external aggregations show that a group of TOPSIS are compatible, and NCRT 1 is selected as the best.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has two courses with different options for medical treatment: the acute exacerbation phase and the stable phase. However, the patients suffered with COPD, whether it is acute or stable, serious or mild, are willing to go to the general hospitals rather than the primary-level professional medical institutions, which leads to the imbalance of medical resources in hospitals with different levels. In order to allocate patients into different levels of hospitals, the fundamental and important thing is to assist the doctors to assess the severity of the COPD patients. This paper establishes an assessment indicator system about the severity of the COPD from the perspectives of system engineering and actual clinical experience, and then proposes a hesitant fuzzy linguistic complex proportional assessment (HFL-COPRAS) method to solve the decision-making problems under hesitant fuzzy linguistic environment. This method not only matches the doctors’ expression habits, but also considers both benefit and cost criteria with the proportional calculation. In addition, the weights of criteria are derived by the negative-ideal-solution-based method. Finally, we apply the HFL-COPRAS method to assess the severity of the COPD patients in the West China Hospital.

In the initial stages of the PSS design process, it is beneficial to predict how the mechanical features of the PSS hardware will impact resale value, so to orient business strategy decisions accordingly. The objective of this work is to propose a methodology to model the resale value of road compaction equipment using data mining techniques. By scrapping and merging data sets from the machine manufacturer and from dealers of second-hand machines, the work discusses how the derived correlations may be used to populate value models for early stage decision making.

AB  - Vehicular ad-hoc Network (VANET) is an emerging type of Mobile ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) with excellent applications in the intelligent traffic system. Applications in VANETs are life critical since human lives are at stake and therefore, interaction among nodes (vehicles) must be established in the most secure manner. To provide security for VANETs, various security measures are designed, the most popular of which is Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). IDS has already proved its worth in detection of malicious nodes in traditional networks but applying the IDS in VANET like networks is somehow different and difficult due to its peculiar characteristics such as resource-constrained nodes, high mobility of nodes, specific protocols stacks, and standards. This paper presents a brief introduction about the various IDSs, in general, to get the readers well acquainted with the concept of IDS after which an in-depth survey of various IDSs that are propounded for VANETs is put forward followed by analyzing and comparing each technique along with merits and demerits. Some basic instructions have also been presented for developing IDSs that have a potential application in VANET and VANET Cloud. Our aim is to identify leading trends, open challenges, and future research directions in the deployment of IDS in VANET. In order to bridge the research gaps in terms of performance, detection rate and overhead, and also to overcome the challenges of existing IDS in literature, a proactive bait based Honeypot optimized IDS system is also proposed with the aim to detect existing and zero-day attacks with minimal overhead. Finally, some open research works being carried out in the field is also proposed.

AB  - The selection of an optimal, efficient and reliable transport and logistics policy is one of the most important factors in supply chain management and logistics planning. Given that decision making in transport and logistics involves the consideration of a number of opposite criteria and possible solutions, such a selection can be considered as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. This study presents a new integrated approach to decision making, i.e. the generation of a robust decision making rule (RDMR) by combining different MCDM methods and Taguchi's robust quality engineering principles. As a logical implication of the proposed approach, a conceptual model of an adaptive and interactive expert system is developed. Its purpose is to enhance the decision making process through enabling the decision maker to: (i) use higher level knowledge regarding the selection of criteria weights and MCDM methods, (ii) estimate the ranking of a new alternative, which can be added to the initial decision matrix after a posteriori analysis of the final rankings of alternatives, and, moreover, quantify its distance from the ideal and the anti-ideal solution. Five different case studies in the field of transport and logistics were considered in order to illustrate the proposed approach. The obtained results and the results of the other MCDM methods were compared using Kendall's tau-b and Spearman's rho tests. An analysis of the final rank stability with respect to the changes in criteria weights was also performed so as to assess the sensitivity of the alternative rankings obtained by the application of different MCDM methods and the proposed approach. To this aim, the Monte Carlo simulation was conducted covering 1000 different scenarios of criteria weights in three different cases. Finally, an additional procedure was introduced for an explicit representation of an RDMR using the design of experiments (DOE) principles.

AB  - Data Mining (DM) is a fundamental component of the Data Science process. Over recent years a huge library of DM algorithms has been developed to tackle a variety of problems in fields such as medical imaging and traffic analysis. Many DM techniques are far more flexible than more classical numerial simulation or statistical modelling approaches. These could be usefully applied to data-rich environmental problems. Certain techniques such as artificial neural networks, clustering, case-based reasoning or Bayesian networks have been applied in environmental modelling, while other methods, like support vector machines among others, have yet to be taken up on a wide scale. There is greater scope for many lesser known techniques to be applied in environmental research, with the potential to contribute to addressing some of the current open environmental challenges. However, selecting the best DM technique for a given environmental problem is not a simple decision, and there is a lack of guidelines and criteria that helps the data scientist and environmental scientists to ensure effective knowledge extraction from data. This paper provides a broad introduction to the use of DM in Data Science processes for environmental researchers. Data Science contains three main steps (pre-processing, data mining and post-processing). This paper provides a conceptualization of Environmental Systems and a conceptualization of DM methods, which are in the core step of the Data Science process. These two elements define a conceptual framework that is on the basis of a new methodology proposed for relating the characteristics of a given environmental problem with a family of Data Mining methods. The paper provides a general overview and guidelines of DM techniques to a non-expert user, who can decide with this support which is the more suitable technique to solve their problem at hand. The decision is related to the bidimensional relationship between the type of environmental system and the type of DM method. An illustrative two way table containing references for each pair Environmental System-Data Mining method is presented and discussed. Some examples of how the proposed methodology is used to support DM method selection are also presented, and challenges and future trends are identified.

AB  - Occupants’ behavior and their interaction with home appliances are crucial for assessing building energy consumption. This study proposes a new methodology for monitoring the energy consumed in building end-use loads to build an advisory system. The built system alerts occupants to take certain measures (prioritized recommendations) to reduce energy consumption of end-use loads. The quantification of potential savings is also provided upon following said measures. The proposed methodology is also capable of evaluating the energy savings performed by the occupants. The system works based on the analysis of historical data generated by occupants using data mining techniques to output highly feasible recommendations. For demonstration purposes, the methodology was tested on the real dataset of a building in Japan. The dataset includes detailed energy consumption of end-use loads, categorized as hot water supply, lighting, kitchen, refrigerator, entertainment & information, housework & sanitary, and others. Results suggest that the developed models are accurate, and that it is possible to save up to 21% of total energy consumption by only changing occupants’ energy use habits.

AB  - Step-stress accelerated degradation testing (SSADT) aims to access the reliability of products in a short time. Bayesian optimal design provides an effective alternative to capture parameters uncertainty, which has been widely employed in SSADT design by optimizing specified utility objective. However, there exist several utility objectives in Bayesian SSADT design; for the engineers, it causes much difficulty to choose the right utility specification with the budget consideration. In this study the problem is formulated as a multi-objective model motivated by the concept of Pareto optimization, which involves three objectives of maximizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, minimizing the quadratic loss function of p-quantile lifetime at usage condition, and minimizing the test cost, simultaneously, in which the product degradation path is described by an inverse Gaussian (IG) process. The formulated programming is solved by NSGA-II to generate the Pareto of optimal solutions, which are further optimally reduced to gain a pruned Pareto set by data envelopment analysis (DEA) for engineering practice. The effectiveness of the proposed methodologies and solution method are experimentally illustrated by electrical connector’s SSADT.

AB  - The aim of this study is to model potential changes in land use and evaluate their effects on sediment load in a Mediterranean watershed, the Carapelle, in Southern Italy. For this purpose, a set of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images were processed to generate three different land use maps for 1987, 2002, and 2011. The images were corrected for geometric distortion and atmospheric interference before performing an unsupervised classification and decision expert system post classification. The land use maps for 1987 and 2002, derived from the Landsat TM processing, were analyzed using a Land Change Modeler (LCM) module to identify transitions from the first land cover type to the second. The transitions were modeled using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network to create transition potential maps, which provide the controls for subsequent dynamic land use change predictions. The model produced a predicted land use map for 2011 using Markov Chain analysis, which was validated with the actual 2011 land use map. Consequently, a land use scenario (S1) for 2035 and 2050 was predicted, taking into account the current constraints and management options. LCM was further used to define two additional scenarios (S2 and S3) both for 2035 and 2050 based on different land management options. Finally, the Annual Agricultural Non-Point Source Pollution Model (AnnAGNPS) was used to estimate the effect of the predicted land use changes on sediment load after model calibration, using a five-year dataset registered at the Ordona monitoring station. The land use change analysis revealed low transformations from 1987 to 2011. Equally, land use changes were low for the base scenario (S1) so moderate variations in sediment load were estimated. The changes in land use were more significant for the additional scenarios (S2 and S3) and consequently the model estimations underwent major variations, with a significant reduction of soil erosion. The associated utilization of land use change analysis and AnnAGNPS modeling demonstrates how land use management options can be adopted to reduce potential watershed sediment load.

The structural weight minimization is a multi-objective optimization problem subjected to fulfilling of strength and stiffness design requirements as well. The desired fitness function connects the multi-objective design requirements to form a single-objective function by using carefully chosen scaling factors and a weight vector to get a near optimal solution. The scaling factors normalize and the weight vector prioritizes the objective functions. The weight vector selection was based on a posteriori articulation, after obtaining a series of Pareto fronts by 3D hull plot of strength, stiffness and assembly weight data points. During the optimization, the algorithm does an intelligent laminate selection based on static strength and alters the ply orientations and thickness of laminae for faster convergence. The study further brings out the influence of mutation percentage on convergence. The optimization procedure on a transport aircraft wing torsion box has showed 29% weight reduction compared to an initial quasi-isotropic laminated structure and 54% with respect to the metallic structure.

Today, many governments support techno-entrepreneurship projects by using several policy tools such as incentives. Evaluating such projects is a very difficult task while a future perspective needs to be provided. In this paper, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been used to determine to factors that should be used in evaluating the techno-entrepreneurship projects. AHP model was set up based on the experts' opinions. The model was tested with real data that contains attributes and outcomes (success/failure) of ten techno-entrepreneurship projects. Subsequently, projects were ranked. It has been seen that three already failed projects were ranked at the end of the list. Thus, the proposed AHP model was verified with these findings. We have seen that target marketing strategy in business technology markets is key to success. The proposed AHP framework in this study is expected to be useful to other societies as well.

AB  - Cashew consumption has been increasing globally, but environmental issues through the whole cashew supply chain, from production, processing and transportation, have been raised. Thus, green supply chain redesign has been put forward but implementation of related practices faces many barriers. Using the case of the Africa cashew industry, which produces over half of global raw cashew nuts but only process less than 10% to kernel, this paper systematically identifies these barriers considering stakeholders through the whole cashew supply chain. Based on evaluation of four experts, results by grey Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory reveal that successful green supply chain redesign implementation needs two elementary efforts by kernel distributors. One is increased collaboration with multi-tier suppliers (producer organizations and processors) and the other is to get strategic support from industry bodies, non-governmental organizations and development agencies. Additionally, in the short-term, kernel distributors need to overcome three key operational barriers, lack of internal top-level management commitment, lack of integrated management information and traceability systems, and uncertainty of economic benefits. Furthermore, barriers such as difficulties to assess environmental sustainability performance and lack of consumer demand for green cashew should be addressed in the long-term. This study contributes to identify barriers to the successful implementation of green supply chain redesign from perspectives of both the focal enterprise and the whole supply chain. A robust multi-criteria decision making method further reveals the most important and fundamental barriers which can offer decision support for kernel distributors and policymakers in the cashew industry.

AB  - Feature selection is an essential step in various tasks, where filter feature selection algorithms are increasingly attractive due to their simplicity and fast speed. A common filter is to use mutual information to estimate the relationships between each feature and the class labels (mutual relevancy), and between each pair of features (mutual redundancy). This strategy has gained popularity resulting a variety of criteria based on mutual information. Other well-known strategies are to order each feature based on the nearest neighbor distance as in ReliefF, and based on the between-class variance and the within-class variance as in Fisher Score. However, each strategy comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. This paper proposes a new filter criterion inspired by the concepts of mutual information, ReliefF and Fisher Score. Instead of using mutual redundancy, the proposed criterion tries to choose the highest ranked features determined by ReliefF and Fisher Score while providing the mutual relevance between features and the class labels. Based on the proposed criterion, two new differential evolution (DE) based filter approaches are developed. While the former uses the proposed criterion as a single objective problem in a weighted manner, the latter considers the proposed criterion in a multi-objective design. Moreover, a well known mutual information feature selection approach (MIFS) based on maximum-relevance and minimum-redundancy is also adopted in single-objective and multi-objective DE algorithms for feature selection. The results show that the proposed criterion outperforms MIFS in both single objective and multi-objective DE frameworks. The results also indicate that considering feature selection as a multi-objective problem can generally provide better performance in terms of the feature subset size and the classification accuracy.

AB  - Industry 4.0 and its other synonyms like Smart Manufacturing, Smart Production or Internet of Things, have been identified as major contributors in the context of digital and automated manufacturing environment. The term industry 4.0 comprises a variety of technologies to enable the development of the value chain resulting in reduced manufacturing lead times, and improved product quality and organizational performance. Industry 4.0 has attracted much attention in the recent literature, however there are very few systematic and extensive review of research that captures the dynamic nature of this topic. The rapidly growing interest from both academics and practitioners in Industry 4.0 has urged the need for review of up-to-date research and development to develop a new agenda. Selected 85 papers were classified in five research categories namely conceptual papers on Industry 4.0, human-machine interactions, machine-equipment interactions, technologies of Industry 4.0 and sustainability. The review primarily attempted to seek answers to the following two questions: (1) What are different research approaches used to study Industry 4.0? and (2) What is the current status of research in the domains of Industry 4.0?. We propose a sustainable Industry 4.0 framework based on the findings of the review with three critical components viz., Industry 4.0 technologies, process integration and sustainable outcomes. Finally, the scope of future research is discussed in detail.

AB  - The process for evaluating and selecting design alternatives is a key stage in the development of a product and can, in essence, be considered a decision-making process. In order to manage this process, Value Methodologies are considered as an important decision support tool, especially by means of the calculation of the Value Index factor, Ivf, for each one of the product functions as a representation of its ‘satisfaction’-to-cost relationship. However, given the subjective nature of the ‘satisfaction’ metric used in its calculation, the process of formulating the Value Index for the different product functions is a complex matter. In this paper, a novel expert system is described for evaluating and selecting design alternatives based on the development of a new methodology for calculating the Value Index factor. The system takes into account efficient management of the uncertainty inherent in the operations by using two concurrent fuzzy-inference processes. The first of these processes manages the determination of the Value Index factor, while the second calculates the Perceived Value factor, a term associated with the risk derived from not modifying the initial parameters in the calculation of the Value Index itself. An autonomous decision system is thus obtained that not only evaluates, selects and recommends the best design alternative, but which also determines the strength of the selection. In addition to the description of this system, a case study is presented that shows the potential benefits obtained from the new methods thus developed. These methods make it possible to improve the use of Value Indices as decision factors in the design process and also to provide new perspectives on the selection of alternatives in the context of Value Methodologies.

AB  - In railway systems, risk monitoring and accident causation analysis are important processes towards operational safety. This paper divides accident causal factors in a railway system into several error types, such as human and signal, and proposes a model based on a complex network for risk monitoring, where the risks of accident causal factors are quantified. This network accident causation model is used to identify accident causal factors and analyze how these factors affect each other, for example, how a signal error leads to a collision between two trains. The results of this case study show that in a complex environment, the proposed model can better identify the root causal factors by quantifying the accident causal factor risk, to find the causation chain based on the interactions among accident causal factors. Based on the analysis results, we can timely and correctly monitor the accident causal factors which have high possibility to raise faults or accidents, thereby protecting the railway system from these factors. The proposed network model provides an effective support for risk monitoring in a railway system.

AB  - Engineering design is undergoing a paradigm shift from design for performance to design for affordability, operability, and durability, seeking multi-objective optimization. To facilitate this transformation, significantly extended design freedom and knowledge must be available in the early design stages. This paper presents a high-fidelity framework for design and optimization of the liquid swirl injectors that are widely used in aerospace propulsion and power-generation systems. The framework assembles a set of techniques, including Design Of Experiment (DOE), high-fidelity Large Eddy Simulations (LES), machine learning, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)-based Kriging surrogate modeling (emulation), inverse problem optimization, and uncertainty quantification. LES-based simulations can reveal detailed spatiotemporal evolution of flow structures and flame dynamics in a high-fidelity manner, and identify important injector design parameters according to their effects on propellant mixing, flame stabilization, and thermal protection. For a given a space of design parameters, DOE determines the number of design points to perform LES-based simulations. POD-based emulations, trained by the LES database, can effectively explore the design space and deduce an optimal group of design parameters in a turn-around time that is reduced by three orders of magnitude. The accuracy of the emulated results is validated, and the uncertainty of prediction is quantified. The proposed design methodology is expected to profoundly extend the knowledge base and reduce the cost for initial design stages.

AB  - One of the key challenges in project organizations is the alignment of portfolio management with major corporate strategies. Usually, project-based organizations use shared resources to control and plan the project portfolio. Therefore, the exploitation of shared resources and project planning decisions made in this regard can change the progress of projects and affect the success rate of the projects. In this article, the integration of system dynamics with multi-objective decision making is applied to address project portfolio selection. The project portfolio has been modeled using four basic dimensions including technology, complexity, innovation and time sensitivity. The aim is to plan and control the progress of project portfolio while maximizing the strategic adaptation subject to the changes of the human resources. For this purpose, a two-stage MO-PSO with TOPSIS is proposed for portfolio selection problem that can solve real-world instances of the problem in a reasonable time. The result of the sensitivity analysis indicated that the proposed decision support system (DSS) provides insights into the impact of strategic alignment on project portfolio selection. According to the simulation results, the integrated methodology of this research can assist in choosing the suitable projects to achieve a project's strategic goals following the organization strategy.

AB  - The neutrosophic set is an excellent tool for dealing with vague and inconsistent information effectively. Consequently, by studying the concept of three-way decisions based on neutrosophic set, we can find a suitable manner to take a reasonable decision. In this article, we suggest two rules of three-way decisions based on three membership degrees of neutrosophic set. A new evaluation function is presented to calculate weights of alternatives, for choosing the best one. We also study a supplier selection problem (selecting suppliers to obtain the indispensable materials for assisting the outputs of companies). The best suppliers need to be selected to enhance quality, service, to reduce cost, and to control time. The most widely used technique for determining the requirements of a company is the Quality Function Deployment (QFD). Since traditional QFD technique does not prioritize stakeholders’ requirements and fails to deal with vague and inconsistent information, this research also integrates it with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) depending on neutrosophic environment. A case study is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

In addition to traffic congestion, environmental concerns are also compelling cities to seek more sustainable modes of transportation. A key factor in the efficacy of bike-share networks is the location of bike stations in relation to potential related criteria. Therefore, site suitability analysis for bike-share stations using quantitative methods is essential. This study attempted to evaluate the current status of bike-share stations in Karsiyaka, Izmir, and to locate future station sites by comparing them to existing stations. To do so, different multi-criteria decision-making methods were combined with a geographic information system (GIS) to address twelve conflicting criteria. Specifically, the analytic hierarchy process was applied to obtain criteria weights, and multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis was used to evaluate current and potential alternatives. Our study demonstrates the superiority of the suggested locations compared to the existing stations.

AB  - Today, bridge design seeks not only to minimize cost, but also to minimize adverse environmental and social impacts. This multi-criteria decision-making problem is subject to variability of the opinions of stakeholders regarding the importance of criteria for sustainability. As a result, this paper proposes a method for designing and selecting optimally sustainable bridges under the uncertainty of criteria comparison. A Pareto set of solutions is obtained using a metamodel-assisted multi-objective optimization. A new decision-making technique introduces the uncertainty of the decision-maker's preference through triangular distributions and thereby ranks the sustainable bridge designs. The method is illustrated by a case study of a three-span post-tensioned concrete box-girder bridge designed according to the embodied energy, overall safety and corrosion initiation time. In this particular case, 211 efficient solutions are reduced to two preferred solutions which have a probability of being selected of 81.6% and 18.4%. In addition, a sensitivity analysis validates the influence of the uncertainty regarding the decision-making. The approach proposed allows actors involved in the bridge design and decision-making to determine the best sustainable design by finding the probability of a given design being chosen.

Global cities must also transition toward more dynamic, sustainable, healthier and smarter futures. However, the supportive transition theories, trajectory agendas, methodologies and pathways are currently under-investigated. This introductory paper provides an overview of the twenty-seven papers included in this special volume, with the objective to document the key lessons learned and to catalyze theoretical dialogue about the evolution of smart cities, healthy cities, eco-cities, and regenerative cities. These authors reviewed how these aspects of evolving cities are measured, monitored and implemented across different geographic, time and cultural contexts. After reviewing and mapping the obstacles and enablers in implementing transitions towards smarter, healthier, sustainable, regenerative, post-fossil carbon, urban societies, the authors of this introductory article provide insights into practical pathways and examples of best practices of their implementation in multiple social, cultural and climatic contexts.

AB  - To transform the existing energy systems towards renewable energy sources, buildings need to use less energy, use energy more efficiently and harness local renewable energy sources. For the design of energy-efficient buildings, building energy simulation of varying sophistication is commonly employed. Types of simulations range from simple, static calculations to sophisticated dynamic simulation. Especially for building retrofit many assumptions on construction, material etc. have to be taken, which increases the uncertainty of simulation results. In conjunction with simulation, methods of Building Performance Optimization are increasingly employed. They are able to identify best performing designs however do not provide insights on the mechanisms and interdependencies of the different design factors, which are most valuable to make informed design decisions. We present a methodology that aims to provide a better understanding and create knowledge about the influence and interactions of different architectural and technical design factors on building energy performance of a specific design task. For this purpose, we introduce Design of Experiments (DoE) in an integrated design workflow using the Design Performance Viewer (DPV) toolset, combining Building Information Modeling (BIM), distributed dynamic simulation and statistical analysis of the extensive simulation results. The experiments created using the methodology allow to identify the strength of effects and interactions of different design factors on selected performance indicators. We apply the methodology on an office retrofit case, introducing a factor scatterplot for result visualization, development and comparison of retrofit strategies. We further evaluate its potential to identify high performing strategies while balancing architectural and technical factors and their impact on energy performance.

AB  - Objective
In this paper, the contribution of distance-based features to automatic sleep stage classification is investigated. The potency of these features is analyzed individually and in combination with 48 conventionally used features.
Methods
The distance-based set consists of 32 features extracted by calculating Itakura, Itakura-Saito and COSH distances of autoregressive and spectral coefficients of Electrocardiography (EEG) (C3-A2), Left EOG, Chin EMG and ECG signals. All the evaluations are performed on three feature sets: distance-based, conventional and total (combined distance based and conventional). Six ranking methods were used to find the top features with the highest discrimination ability in each set. The ranked feature lists were evaluated using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision-tree-based multi-SVM (DSVM) classifiers for five sleep stages including Wake, REM, N1, N2 and N3. Furthermore, the ability of distance-based and conventional features to discriminate between each pair of sleep stages was evaluated using t-test, a hypothesis testing method.
Results
Distance-based features occupied 25% of top-ranked features. Simulation results showed that using distance-based features together with conventional features can lead to an enhancement of accuracy. The best classification accuracy (85.5%) was achieved by DSVM classifier and 13 features selected by mRMR-MID and normalized with Min-Max method for total feature set, where two of them were from the distance-based feature set. The t-test results show that distance-based features outperform conventional features in discriminating between N1 and REM stages that is usually a challenge for classification systems.
Conclusion
Distance-based features have a positive contribution to sleep stage classification, including enhancement of accuracy and better REM-N1 discrimination ability.
Significance
The main motivation for this work was to evaluate new features to characterize each sleep stage in such a way that extracted features were more powerful than conventional features, to distinguish sleep stages from each other, and to improve classifiers accuracy.

AB  - With the help of advanced technologies, district heating systems were gradually improved to increase fuel use efficiency and reduce environmental impacts. Several control strategies focused on the performance improvement of energy generation or distribution in the network. However, most strategies overlooked zone-scaled thermal comfort related to occupant characteristics, and there was lack of studies combined with heat trading concepts. This research presents energy cost analysis of an intelligent network model and heat trading to mitigate increases of energy use and thermal dissatisfaction in a district model. Advanced thermal control algorithms provide optimized supply air conditions responding to occupant characteristics in different buildings. A distribution model contributes to the reduction of energy consumption, and heat trading effects are analyzed to maximize energy cost savings in a district model. In comparison with a conventional model, an intelligent controller improves thermal comfort by about 16.2% for a clinic, 2.4% for an office, and 7.1% for a residential building, respectively. Also, a distribution model with heat trading concept saves total energy costs by about 24.7%, theoretically. In conclusion, the model has advantages that it properly responds to occupant characteristics to mitigate thermal dissatisfaction, and it has a great potential to reduce total energy costs.

AB  - Inspired by the success of deep learning methods, for human activity recognition based on individual vision cues, this paper presents a ConvNets based approach for activity recognition by combining multiple vision cues. Moreover, a new method of creating skeleton images, from skeleton joint sequences, representing motion information is presented in this paper. Motion representation images, namely, Motion History Image (MHI), Depth Motion Maps (DMMs) and skeleton images are constructed from RGB, depth and skeletal data of RGB-D sensor. These images are then separately trained on ConvNets and respective softmax scores are fused at the decision level. The combination of these distinct vision cues, leads to complete utilization of data, available from RGB-D sensor. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed 5-CNNs approach, we conduct our experiments on three well known and challenging RGB-D datasets, CAD-60, SBU Kinect interaction and UTD-MHAD. Results show that the proposed approach of combining multiple cues by means of decision level fusion is competitive with other state of the art methods.

AB  - This investigation aims to propose a hybrid three-stage Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) - Artificial Neural Network (ANN) - Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) approach, together abbreviated as the SEANIS, for analyzing the factors influencing cloud computing adoption (CCA) services in the context of Indian private organizations. This study proposed new determinants, namely risk analysis and perceived IT security risk as an extension of the Technology Organization Environment (TOE) model. The data collected from the industry experts were analyzed using SEM and ANN approaches. The results of SEM revealed that trust (T), management style (MS), technology innovation (TI), risk analysis (RA), and perceived IT security risk (PITR) exercised a significant influence on CCA. The SEM results were taken as inputs for the ANN approach and ISM methodology. The results of ANN highlighted that perceived IT security risk, trust, and management style were the most important determinants for CCA. On the other hand, the ISM tool identified five factors, namely, decrease of internal systems availability (F1) (PITR cluster), utilization of internal resources (F14) (MS cluster), assurance of data privacy increases adoption rate (F16) (T cluster), innovativeness (F21), and previous experience (F22) (both from the TI cluster) as the top five significant variables with high driving power, among the 43 factors. The outcome of the hybrid approach is intended to guide the decision and policy-makers for easy evaluation of their organizational goals for choosing the most suitable computing environment for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their business performance.

AB  - In previous research, an innovative hybrid material double-hat thin-walled beam has been proposed for vehicle bumper system, which has demonstrated great potentials for improved pedestrian safety and reduced weight. In this work, we have used aluminum foam to fill the hybrid double-hat beam to further its application in vehicle bodies with increased bending resistance and energy absorption efficiency. Bending behaviors of both empty and foam-filled hybrid beams were numerically investigated using the validated LS-DYNA models. Three representative loading positions including the mid-span, 50 mm and 100 mm offsets from the mid-span were simulated to reveal the effect of load position uncertainty. It was found that the foam filler could increase the specific energy absorption (SEA) by more than 30% and double the bending moment (Mb) of the empty hybrid beam by changing its deformation pattern. Moreover, the foam-filled beam shows more robust crashworthiness performance against load position variation. Using radial basis function (RBF) metamodels, the multi-objective design optimization (MDO) problems were formulated for both empty and filled hybrid beams to maximize SEA and Mb and minimize the initial peak force (Fip). The multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) was used to seek the Pareto fronts of the MDO problems. The MDO results show that the foam-filled beam has much broader performance space in terms of Fip, SEA and Mb and has great potentials for high-energy crash applications. It was also found that the Pareto front varies for different loading positions for either empty or filled hybrid beam. Including multiple loading positions could achieve a more robust design against load uncertainty. Appropriate weighting factors should be chosen for different loading positions to yield realistic and more robust designs of the proposed hybrid beams.

AB  - This study aimed to identify the relative importance of the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) that contribute to the success and development of hotel industry in Malaysia. Drawing uponTechnology-Organization-Environment (TOE) and Human-Organization-Technology (HOT) fit models, this study developed a theoretical model to predict the significant factors that contribute to the success and development of hotel industry. A two-stage Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) method was applied to test the research model and reveal the importance level of factors in the model. SEM analysis showed that the use of IT, financial performance, benchmarking, service standardization, top management support, customer satisfaction, service quality, hotel interior and exterior design/look, location, employee training and empowerment were significant factors influencing hotel success and development. Moreover, the results of ANFIS showed that customer satisfaction under human dimension was the most critical predictor of hotel success and development.

AB  - The study of eco-design practices has become an important aspect of sustainable manufacturing. Therefore, the identification and selection of key drivers for eco-design implementation is becoming essential. However, further research is needed in order to understand what are the key drivers that increase the efficiency of eco-design implementation and improve the company’s sustainability performance. The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate the drivers for implementation of eco-design in the Finnish pulp and paper industry. The drivers are identified through literature research and a survey is conducted for their evaluation. Data analysis is performed by using ranking methodology in order to investigate and identify the key drivers for eco-design implementation practices in the Finnish pulp and paper industry. Driver for implementation “Management’s idea” and driver “Customer demand” for both continuation and implementation have the highest rank in all scenarios. In contrast, driver ‘One or few employees pushed idea’ for implementation and drivers ‘Personal quest for a better environment’ and ‘Increased employee satisfaction through environmental initiatives’ from for continuation have the lowest rank for the all scenarios. This study adds knowledge into the current literature of sustainable manufacturing and will provide insights to practitioners and decision makers in terms of eco-design implementation issues in an effective and efficient manner.
