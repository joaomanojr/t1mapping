abstract = {WRESTORE (Watershed REstoration using SpatioTemporal Optimization of REsources) (http://wrestore.iupui.edu), is a web-based environmental decision support system where stakeholders collaborate with an interactive optimization algorithm to design user-centric solutions of best management practices on a watershed landscape. WRESTORE utilizes the Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrologic model for simulating the impact of landscape decisions on watershed processes. The WRESTORE system is one of many systems which interacts with users directly and thus is directly influenced by the quality and quantity of data in user feedback. The user modeling component within the WRESTORE decision support system utilizes neural network approaches, such as deep learning. Working with small data on user modeling is a non-trivial task which is examined in more detail in this study. We believe the originality of our approach centers on integrating user models with limited data in this application-specific interactive design and human-computer collaborative problem-solving approach. This paper thus has three objectives: i) describe the WRESTORE system and how it performs interactive optimization of watershed design, ii) outline current work in user modeling with limited data, and iii) describe our solutions for using and implementing accurate virtual stakeholder models based upon limited training samples.},

abstract = {The service selection in a Next Generation Network field remains a challenging problem for service providers, as they have to satisfy customers and keep their earnings. Given the growing number of telecom service providers, the customer is in a dilemma to choose the right service with a fair price. To do so, we propose in this paper a supervised learning algorithm since it is a classification problem. Based on requirements specified in the contract called Service Level Agreement (SLA) in IP Multimedia Service (IMS) network, we ended up choosing the decision trees algorithm for several reasons that we will explore later in this work. This method will assist users in selecting the right service for a better management of contracts between the involved entities.},

publisher = {International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems},
address = {Richland, SC},
abstract = {In multi-objective decision planning and learning, much attention is paid to producing optimal solution sets that contain an optimal policy for every possible user preference profile. We argue that the step that follows, i.e, determining which policy to execute by maximising the user's intrinsic utility function over this (possibly infinite) set, is under-studied. This paper aims to fill this gap. We build on previous work on Gaussian processes and pairwise comparisons for preference modelling, extend it to the multi-objective decision support scenario, and propose new ordered preference elicitation strategies based on ranking and clustering. Our main contribution is an in-depth evaluation of these strategies using computer and human-based experiments. We show that our proposed elicitation strategies outperform the currently used pairwise methods, and found that users prefer ranking most. Our experiments further show that utilising monotonicity information in GPs by using a linear prior mean at the start and virtual comparisons to the nadir and ideal points, increases performance. We demonstrate our decision support framework in a real-world study on traffic regulation, conducted with the city of Amsterdam.},

abstract = {We discuss a bicriteria scheduling problem for parallel identical batch processing machines in semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities (wafer fabs). Only jobs that belong to the same family can be batched together. The performance measures of interest are the total weighted completion time and the electricity power cost. Unequal release dates of the jobs are taken into account. The jobs can have non-identical sizes. We provide a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for the general setting. Moreover, we analyze the special case where all jobs have the same size, the maximum batch size is an integer multiple of this job size, and all jobs are available at time zero. We prove certain properties of Pareto-optimal schedules for this special case. These properties lead to a MILP formulation that is more tractable than the one for the general setting. We perform computational experiments with the ε-constraint method for both formulations.},

abstract = {Our devices and interactions in a world where physical and digital realities are more and more blended, generate a continuum of multimedia data that needs to be stored, shared and processed to provide services that enrich our daily lives. Cloud computing plays a key role in these tasks, dissolving resource allocation and computational boundaries, but it also requires advanced security mechanisms to protect the data and provide privacy guarantees. Therefore, security assurance must be evaluated before offloading tasks to a cloud provider, a process which is currently manual, complex and inadequate for dynamic scenarios. However, though there are many tools for evaluating cloud providers according to quality of service criteria, automated categorization and selection based on risk metrics is still challenging. To address this gap, we present FRiCS, a Framework for Risk-driven Cloud Selection, which contributes with: 1) a set of cloud security metrics and risk-based weighting policies, 2) distributed components for metric extraction and aggregation, and 3) decision-making plugins for ranking and selection. We have implemented the whole system and conducted a case-study validation based on public cloud providers' security data, showing the benefits of the proposed approach.},

isbn = {978153866570},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Port planning and management has become a difficult task due to the increasing number of elements involved in port operations, their nature (random in some cases), and the relationships between them. Generally, traditional methods involving empirical formulas or queuing theory can be useful though only for simple cases. In the case of complex systems, the problem needs to be approached from a holistic point of view, and more advanced methodologies should be considered. In such cases, simulation may be the most appropriate solution, especially nowadays, when computation and data management are increasingly more efficient. A methodology for port planning and management, based on Monte Carlo simulation, is presented in this paper. A new software application, OptiPort, has been developed based on this methodology, proposed for use by port managers and planners. The methodology and the software have been validated with real data from the Port of Algeciras.},

In these settings, the aggregate score should increase with the amount of collected evidence --- bound by the law of diminishing returns --- unlike in typical fusion methods where usually averages are estimated. The suggested operator may also model relevance, importance, association or any score that is mainly characterized by the cardinality of supporting inputs.},

abstract = {Despite the rapid growth of hardware capacity and popularity in mobile devices, limited resources in battery and processing capacity still lack the ability to meet increasing mobile users’ demands. Both conventional techniques and emerging approaches are brought together to fill this gap between user demand and mobile devices’ limited capabilities. Recent research has focused on enhancing the performance of mobile devices via augmentation techniques. Augmentation techniques for mobile cloud computing refer to the computing paradigms and solutions to outsource mobile device computation and storage to more powerful computing resources in order to enhance a mobile device’s computing capability and energy efficiency (e.g., code offloading). Adopting augmentation techniques in the heterogeneous and intermittent mobile cloud computing environment creates new challenges for computation management, energy efficiency, and system reliability. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive taxonomy and survey of the existing techniques and frameworks for mobile cloud augmentation regarding both computation and storage. Different from the existing taxonomies in this field, we focus on the techniques aspect, following the idea of realizing a complete mobile cloud computing system. The objective of this survey is to provide a guide on what available augmentation techniques can be adopted in mobile cloud computing systems as well as supporting mechanisms such as decision-making and fault tolerance policies for realizing reliable mobile cloud services. We also present a discussion on the open challenges and future research directions in this field.},

abstract = {Research on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) has produced over the past decades a large number of algorithms and a rich literature on performance assessment tools to evaluate and compare them. Yet, newly proposed MOEAs are typically compared against very few, often a decade older MOEAs. One reason for this apparent contradiction is the lack of a common baseline for comparison, with each subsequent study often devising its own experimental scenario, slightly different from other studies. As a result, the state of the art in MOEAs is a disputed topic. This article reports a systematic, comprehensive evaluation of a large number of MOEAs that covers a wide range of experimental scenarios. A novelty of this study is the separation between the higher-level algorithmic components related to multi-objective optimization (MO), which characterize each particular MOEA, and the underlying parameters—such as evolutionary operators, population size, etc.—whose configuration may be tuned for each scenario. Instead of relying on a common or “default” parameter configuration that may be low-performing for particular MOEAs or scenarios and unintentionally biased, we tune the parameters of each MOEA for each scenario using automatic algorithm configuration methods. Our results confirm some of the assumed knowledge in the field, while at the same time they provide new insights on the relative performance of MOEAs for many-objective problems. For example, under certain conditions, indicator-based MOEAs are more competitive for such problems than previously assumed. We also analyze problem-specific features affecting performance, the agreement between performance metrics, and the improvement of tuned configurations over the default configurations used in the literature. Finally, the data produced is made publicly available to motivate further analysis and a baseline for future comparisons.},
