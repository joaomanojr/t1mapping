abstract = {In multi-objective decision planning and learning, much attention is paid to producing optimal solution sets that contain an optimal policy for every possible user preference profile. We argue that the step that follows, i.e, determining which policy to execute by maximising the user's intrinsic utility function over this (possibly infinite) set, is under-studied. This paper aims to fill this gap. We build on previous work on Gaussian processes and pairwise comparisons for preference modelling, extend it to the multi-objective decision support scenario, and propose new ordered preference elicitation strategies based on ranking and clustering. Our main contribution is an in-depth evaluation of these strategies using computer and human-based experiments. We show that our proposed elicitation strategies outperform the currently used pairwise methods, and found that users prefer ranking most. Our experiments further show that utilising monotonicity information in GPs by using a linear prior mean at the start and virtual comparisons to the nadir and ideal points, increases performance. We demonstrate our decision support framework in a real-world study on traffic regulation, conducted with the city of Amsterdam.},

abstract = {In the recommender system, the most important is the decision-making solutionto consulte for user. Depending on the type and size of data stored, decision-making will always be improved to produce the best possible result.. The main task in implementing the model is to use methods to find the most valuable product or service for the user. In this paper, we propose a new approach to building a multi-user based collaborative filtering model using the interaction multi-criteria decision with ordered weighted averaging operator. This model demonstrates the synergy and interplay between user criteria for decision making. The model was evaluated through experimentation with the multirecsys tool on three datasets: MovieLense 100K, MSWeb and Jester5k. The experiment illustrated the model comparison with some other interactive multi-criteria counseling methods that have been researchedon both sparse datasets and thick datasets. In addition, the model is compared and evaluated with item-base collaborative filtering model using the interaction multi-criteria decision with ordered weighted averaging operator on two types of datasets. Consultancy results of the proposed model are quite effective compared to some traditional consulting models and some models with other operator. This counseling model can be applied well in a variety of contexts, especially in the case of sparse data, this model will give result in improved counseling. In addition, with the above method, the user-base model is always more efficient than item-base on all datasets.},

The prediction of drug response can highly improve the clinical results and reduce the financial costs associated with chemotherapy treatment. In this paper, we present a new approach to improve the accuracy of predicting the sensitivity of cell lines to anticancer drugs. Our approach relies on selecting relevant features impacting the efficiency of predictive algorithms. We propose a multi-criteria recommendation method to identify the most accurate prediction algorithm according to the available input data. For each iteration, a different algorithm may be selected, and the optimal accuracy may be reached.

abstract = {We consider the problem of parametric verification, presenting a recent statistical method to perform parametric verification of linear time properties of stochastic models, estimating the satisfaction probability as a function of model or property parameters. The approach leverages Bayesian Machine Learning based on Gaussian Processes. Under mild conditions on continuity of parameters of the satisfaction probability, it can be shown that property satisfaction is a smooth function of such parameters. Gaussian Processes can effectively capture this smoothness and obtain more-accurate estimates of satisfaction probabilities by transferring information across the parameter space. We leveraged this approach to efficiently solve several tasks, like parameter synthesis, system design, counterexample generation, and requirement synthesis. In this tutorial, we will introduce the basic ideas of the approach and give an overview of the different applications.},

abstract = {Application-specific MPSoCs profit immensely from a custom-fit Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture in terms of network performance and power consumption. In this paper we suggest a new approach to explore application-specific NoC architectures. In contrast to other heuristics, our approach uses a set of network modifications defined with graph rewriting rules to model the design space exploration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The MDP can be efficiently explored using the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) heuristics. We formulate a weighted sum reward function to compute a single solution with a good trade-off between power and latency or a set of max reward functions to compute the complete Pareto front between the two objectives. The Wavefront feature adds additional efficiency when computing the Pareto front by exchanging solutions between parallel MCTS optimization processes. Comparison with other popular search heuristics demonstrates a higher efficiency of MCTS-based heuristics for several test cases. Additionally, the Wavefront-MCTS heuristics allows complete tracability and control by the designer to enable an interactive design space exploration process.},

abstract = {Extracting interesting tuples from a large database is an important problem in multi-criteria decision making. Two representative queries were proposed in the literature: top- k queries and skyline queries. A top- k query requires users to specify their utility functions beforehand and then returns k tuples to the users. A skyline query does not require any utility function from users but it puts no control on the number of tuples returned to users. Recently, a k-regret query was proposed and received attention from the community because it does not require any utility function from users and the output size is controllable, and thus it avoids those deficiencies of top- k queries and skyline queries. Specifically, it returns k tuples that minimize a criterion called the maximum regret ratio .In this paper, we present the lower bound of the maximum regret ratio for the k -regret query. Besides, we propose a novel algorithm, called SPHERE, whose upper bound on the maximum regret ratio is asymptotically optimal and restriction-free for any dimensionality, the best-known result in the literature. We conducted extensive experiments to show that SPHERE performs better than the state-of-the-art methods for the k -regret query.},

abstract = {Recommender systems algorithms are generally evaluated primarily on machine learning criteria such as recommendation accuracy or top-n precision. In this work, we evaluate six recommendation algorithms from a user-centric perspective, collecting both objective user activity data and subjective user perceptions. In a field experiment involving 1508 users who participated for at least a month, we compare six algorithms built using machine learning techniques, ranging from supervised matrix factorization, contextual bandit learning to Q learning. We found that the objective design in machine-learning-based recommender systems significantly affects user experience. Specifically, a recommender optimizing for implicit action prediction error engages users more than optimizing for explicit rating prediction error when modeled with the classical matrix factorization algorithms, which empirically explains the historical transition of recommender system research from modeling explicit feedback data to implicit feedback data. However, the action-based recommender is not as precise as the rating-based recommender in that it increases not only positive engagement but also negative engagement, e.g., negative action rate and user browsing effort which are negatively correlated with user satisfaction. We show that blending both explicit and implicit feedback from users through an online learning algorithm can gain the benefits of engagement and mitigate one of the possible costs (i.e., the increased browsing effort).},

We employ crowdsourcing to evaluate, for a set of tasks, user ability to choose effective formulations in each language. The results of this initial study show that users were able to determine more effective formulations for the tasks using pairwise comparisons. Furthermore, it was found that users tend to express a preference for one language over the other, although it was not necessarily the language that they performed best in.},

Factors regarding patients, staff, and hospitals are considered in the decision. This framework is piloted using the Emergency Department(ED) of a leading university hospital in Dublin. The optimized base staffing patterns and shift schedules actively contributed to solving ED overcrowding problem and reduced the average waiting time for patients by 43% compared to the current waiting time of discharged patients. The reduction was achieved by optimizing the staffing level and then determining the shift schedule that minimized the understaffing and overstaffing of the personnel need to meet patient demand.},

Concretely, we define a deep learning method for relation-based argument mining to extract argumentative relations of attack and support. We then use this method for determining whether news articles support tweets, a useful task in fact-checking settings, where determining agreement toward a statement is a useful step toward determining its truthfulness. Furthermore, we use our method for extracting bipolar argumentation frameworks from reviews to help detect whether they are deceptive. We show experimentally that our method performs well in both settings. In particular, in the case of deception detection, our method contributes a novel argumentative feature that, when used in combination with other features in standard supervised classifiers, outperforms the latter even on small data sets.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of the network-enabled devices and communication technologies that allow connectivity and integration of physical objects (Things) into the digital world (Internet). Enormous amounts of dynamic IoT data are collected from Internet-connected devices. IoT data are usually multi-variant streams that are heterogeneous, sporadic, multi-modal, and spatio-temporal. IoT data can be disseminated with different granularities and have diverse structures, types, and qualities. Dealing with the data deluge from heterogeneous IoT resources and services imposes new challenges on indexing, discovery, and ranking mechanisms that will allow building applications that require on-line access and retrieval of ad-hoc IoT data. However, the existing IoT data indexing and discovery approaches are complex or centralised, which hinders their scalability. The primary objective of this article is to provide a holistic overview of the state-of-the-art on indexing, discovery, and ranking of IoT data.

The second, called the multiobjective ensembling DNN MOE-DNN, takes the learned features from MOL-DNN as inputs and separately predicts clean LPS and IRM, clean MFCC and IRM, and clean GFCC and IRM using three sets of weak regression functions. Finally, a postprocessing operation can be applied to the estimated clean features by leveraging the multiple targets learned from both the MOL-DNN and the MOE-DNN. On speech corrupted by 15 noise types not seen in model training the SE results show that the MOLE approach, which features a small model size and low run-time latency, can achieve consistent improvements over both DNN- and long short-term memory LSTM-based techniques in terms of all the objective metrics evaluated in this study for all three cases the input contexts contain 1-frame, 4-frame and 7-frame instances. The 1-frame MOLE-based SE system outperforms the DNN-based SE system with a 7-frame input expansion at a 3-frame delay and also achieves better performance than the LSTM-based SE system with 4-frame, no delay expansion by including only 3 previous frames, and with 170 times less processing latency.},

abstract = {We propose a new functional form for deriving an aggregate score from a possibly unbounded or unknown number of inputs expressing supporting evidence along with quantified confidence on that evidence. The evidence indicators should be considered indepedent in the general case, with each one contributing additional supporting evidence for the case under analysis. In these settings, the aggregate score should increase with the amount of collected evidence --- bound by the law of diminishing returns --- unlike in typical fusion methods where usually averages are estimated. The suggested operator may also model relevance, importance, association or any score that is mainly characterized by the cardinality of supporting inputs.},

abstract = {Parallelizing Bayesian Optimization has recently attracted a lot of attention. The challenge is usually to estimate the effect multiple new samples will have on the posterior distribution of the objective function, and the combinatorial explosion of the possible sample locations. In this paper, we show that at least for multi-task Bayesian Optimization, parallelization is straightforward because the benefit of samples is independent as long as they are sufficiently far apart in the task space. We propose a simple penalization approach proportional to correlation based on the kernel and demonstrate that for the problem settings we considered, the efficacy of our parallel multi-task Bayesian Optimization algorithm is close to the sequential version, while being able to exploit parallel computation to speed up optimization. Depending on the setup considered, we observe efficiencies of parallelization between 69% and 100%.},
