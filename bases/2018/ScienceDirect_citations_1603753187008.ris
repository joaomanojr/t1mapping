AB  - Clustering is among the most widely used data mining tasks since it plays an important role in organizing huge amounts of data. It aims to form natural groupings by partitioning sets of data objects into disjoint and homogeneous groups. The present paper proposes an enhanced version of a recently appeared heuristic for clustering large categorical datasets, called Transitive heuristic. The improvements brought to the original heuristic concern mainly the calculation of the representatives of clusters and the manner in which each data object is processed. Experiments based on real-life datasets demonstrate that the proposed version yields more accurate results.

AB  - To halt the loss of biodiversity in natural habitats, the EU passed the Habitats Directive and established the Natura 2000 network. The network captured forest habitats and habitat types, whose conservation status must be reported under Article 17 of the Directive. Hence, the harmonization of habitat assessment methods and reporting formats are a critical issue. So far, the EU Commission and Member States have managed to design and issue reporting guidelines. However, as many of these reports are largely based on expert opinions, they tend to be biased and incomparable. To make conservation status assessments and reporting more consistent, this study evaluated a set of indicators with two decision support models. The DEX model operated with linguistic statements derived from numerical values, while the fuzzy model utilized numeric input. Both models were tested with data from Slovenia's three largest forest habitat types (FHT), namely 9110 – Luzulo-Fagetum beech forests, 91K0 – Illyrian Fagus sylvatica forests (Aremonio-Fagion) and 91L0 – Illyrian oak-hornbeam forests (Erythronio-Carpinion), provided by the Forest and Forest Ecosystem Condition Survey. The DEX model produced uniform results and defined the conservation status of all three FHTs as least favorable. Conversely, the fuzzy model produced three different conservation status grades for the FHTs: a favorable conservation status for the 91K0 FHT, least favorable for the 9110 FHT and unfavorable for the 91L0 FHT. Its results were logical and in accord with the existing assessments. The study showed that both models could be used for the evaluation of FHT traits. However, because of its larger sensitivity, the fuzzy model allowed detecting subtle differences among the indicator values due to the use of continuous numerical data and more sophisticated mathematical procedures.

AB  - The baggage handling system is a crucial part of ground handling operations, which significantly contributes to the overall satisfaction of passengers. Although several studies have investigated airline service quality, little attention has been paid to this crucial part of the system. This study proposes the SERVQUAL model to assess the perceived quality of service for the baggage handling system. A literature review provides a list of criteria per dimension of the SERVQUAL model. The best worst method (BWM) is used to calculate the weights of the criteria. The data for the BWM are collected via a sample of passengers from different nationalities. It is found that ‘reliability’ is perceived as the most important dimension followed by ‘responsiveness’. The ‘assurance’ criterion is third closely followed by ‘tangibles’ and lastly ‘empathy’. A cluster analysis further sheds light on how passengers might have different service quality priorities.

AB  - Achieving high accuracy and comprehensiveness in node importance evaluation of complex networks is time-consuming. To solve this problem, a method based on Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) was proposed. Firstly, four complicated importance indicators which reflect the node importance globally and comprehensively were selected. Then analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was applied to obtain the node’s importance evaluation. On this basis, three simple indicators with low computational complexity were proposed, and LS-SVM was adopted to find the mapping rules between simple indicators and AHP evaluation. The experiments on artificial network and actual network show the validity of proposed method: the evaluation based on complicated indicators is consistent with reality and reflects node importance accurately; simple indicators evaluation by LS-SVM saved a lot of computational time and improved the evaluating efficiency. Our method can provide guidance on influential node identification in large scale complex networks.

AB  - Determining the most suitable application(s) of a stone increases its service life in the buildings. Quality of building stones is associated with numerous physicomechanical properties or Impacting Factors (IFs). However, no comprehensive framework has yet been developed in this regard. In this study, firstly, each IF for each stone type was classified into three scenarios as ‘Poor’, ‘Medium’, and ‘Good’, the limits of which were obtained by investigating the data from multiple sources and standards. Then, three magnitudes in the range of 1–3 were assigned to the scenarios with the aid of a fuzzy inference system. Finally, using Folchi mathematical model, 6 common applications were evaluated from the viewpoint of 14 IFs by a correlation matrix. Eventually, a new index called the Applicability Score (AS) was defined to facilitate the stone selecting process and also finding its most suitable application. Implementing this model in Ask Travertine Quarry, Iran, gave an AS score of 120.45, placing the quarry at a medium quality level, which is consistent with the current sale price of quarry's polished stones. Moreover, the facade was recognized as the most appropriate application for the intended quarry.

AB  - Credit rating is a process for building a classification system for credit lenders to characterize current or potential credit borrowers. By such a process, financial institutions classify borrowers for lending decision by evaluating their financial and/or nonfinancial performances. Recently, use of social media data has emerged an important source of information. Accordingly, social media data can be very useful in evaluating companies' credibility when financial or non-financial assessments are missing or unreliable as well as when credit analyzers' subjective perceptions manipulate the decision. In this study, a multiple criteria credit rating approach is proposed to determine companies' credibility level utilizing social media data as well as financial measures. Additionally, to strengthen the lender's interpretation and inference competency, ratings are represented with a risk distribution based on cumulative belief degrees. Sentiment analysis, a web mining and text classification method, is used to collect social media data on Twitter. Importance of criteria is revealed through pairwise comparisons. Companies' performance scores and ratings are obtained by a cumulative belief degree approach. The proposed approach is applied to 64 companies. Results indicate that social media provides valuable information to determine companies' creditability. However credit ratings tend to decrease when social media data is considered.

The analytic network process (ANP) methodology and k-means clustering were used. Basing on data obtained from Eurostat, ICT attributes were selected and the network of criteria was built. The preferences for main criteria were extracted from empirical data for each analyzed country (each decision variant). The obtained priority values reflected strengths of the analyzed regions. The preferences for sub-criteria were determined basing on that the criteria describing the newest fields of ICT development (e-commerce and e-business in general) are considered most important. With regard to that, the multi-criteria analysis showed that Slovenia and Austria were leaders in Central Europe in 2017, and the worst-performing country was Poland, preceded by Hungary. The results of the study can be used to generalize about the level of ICT development of each country.

AB  - This study examines the supply contract problem in supply chain management, in which the uncertain demand is affected by a variety of factors. Since the available historical data cannot adequately determine the exact probability distribution of future demand, the prediction of experienced experts about uncertain demand is usually required in the practical modeling process of supply contract problem. The main contributions of this study are to model the uncertain demand by both probability distribution and possibility distribution, and develop a new two-stage expected value optimization model for our supply contract problem, in which an options-futures contract is employed to reduce the risk of uncertain demand. In the first decision-making stage, the distributor signs an options-futures contract with the supplier to determine the futures and options ordering quantities. After knowing the realization of uncertain demand, the distributor takes the signed options as the recourse decision in the second stage. When the actual demand follows some common probability and possibility distributions, the proposed two-stage optimization model can be turned into its deterministic equivalent programming model so that it can be solved efficiently via commercial optimization software. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method, a practical natural gas supply contract problem is provided in our numerical experiments. The computational results demonstrate that the possibility distribution of uncertain demand does affect the ordering decisions, and modeling uncertain demand by both probability distribution and possibility distribution is more realistic in our natural gas supply contract problem. As a result, the proposed two-stage optimization method can guide distributors to make their informed decisions in practical supply contract problem when the probability distribution of uncertain demand is partially known.

AB  - System engineering is an established methodology meant to support engineering design activities for complex systems design. Nuclear fusion devices design complexity derives from contextual presence of both a challenging operating domain requiring frontier technology and a restrictive regulation on safety or systems compatibility aspects. System engineering methodologies adapted to nuclear design environment reduce risks of late design changes related to compatibility problems emerging at integration stage. Present work describes the methodology developed for the conceptual design phase of a nuclear fusion neutronic diagnostic, the Radial Neutron Camera for ITER plant. In particular the focus is on the characterization of design intents and the structured exploration of design domain aiming at baseline architecture to be engineered in next design phase. A formal definition of design domain space in terms of architectural elements has been developed to allow the instantiation of a set of candidate options. The instantiation process was structured according to sub-system intrinsic information content and potential mutual impact. Finally, architectural options have been assessed according to a specifically defined ranking function able to integrate information characterizing the candidate architectures deriving from different domains enabling a close collaboration with stakeholders.

AB  - To aid the design of buildings with lower environmental impacts, it is important to be able to rapidly compare the predicted impacts and costs of design alternatives at early stages of the design process when many influential decisions are made. At the same time, it is also important to preserve design flexibility in order to better accommodate diverse project constraints and goals. This paper presents the first use of an early-design, probabilistic life cycle assessment (LCA) method to identify and summarize the characteristics of buildings with near-optimum or “quasi-optimum” life cycle impacts and costs. Two design guidance methods are explored: sequential specification – in which influential attributes are iteratively identified and specified – and genetic optimization. The efficiency of these methods are compared using information entropy to quantify the flexibility of the probabilistic design as it is refined. Genetic optimization is found to be more efficient than sequential specification because it leads to more optimal solutions with greater flexibility. Quasi-optimum designs are identified and analyzed to determine which attributes must be specified in a particular way and which attributes have more flexible ranges to achieve a given percentage of the optimum reduction in impacts and costs. It is found that quasi-optimum designs representing 75% of these optimum reductions can be associated with a 40% increase in design flexibility over optimized designs. Twelve cases are presented that explore the influence of climate, analysis period, energy-related impact factor variability, and optimization weighting of impacts and costs on quasi-optimum designs.

AB  - Safeguard the operator health is nowadays a hot topic for most of the companies whose production process relies on manual manufacturing and assembly activities. European legislations, national regulations and international standards force the companies to assess the risk of musculoskeletal disorders of operators while they are performing manual tasks. Furthermore, international corporates typically require their partners to adopt and implement particular indices and procedures to assess the ergonomic risks specific of their industrial sector. The expertise and time required by the ergonomic assessment activity compels the companies to huge financial, human and technological investments. An original Motion Analysis System (MAS) is developed to facilitate the evaluation of most of the ergonomic indices traditionally adopted by manufacturing firms. The MAS exploits a network of marker-less depth cameras to track and record the operator movements and postures during the performed tasks. The big volume of data provided by this motion capture technology is employed by the MAS to automatically and quantitatively assesses the risk of musculoskeletal disorders over the entire task duration and for each body part. The developed hardware/software architecture is tested and validated with a real industrial case study of a car manufacturer which adopts the European Assembly Worksheet (EAWS) to assess the ergonomic risk of its assembly line operators. The results suggest how the MAS is a powerful architecture compared to other motion capture solutions. Indeed, this technology accurately assesses the operator movements and his joint absolute position in the assembly station 3D layout. Finally, the MAS automatically and quantitatively fill out the different EAWS sections, traditionally evaluated through time- and resource-consuming activities.

The results indicate that the scientific publications are highly unbalanced at regional levels in China, and the USA is China's most important partner in FT cooperative researches. Collaborations are not indispensable for high-quality research outputs in FT area. The existing researches in the field of FT from Chinese scholars focus primarily on Computer Science and Engineering. The emerging trends of FT researches from Chinese scholars have shifted away from basic FT researches to the applications, such as the areas of decision making, optimization, modeling and design.

Diesel and B20 fuel were considered as baseline fuels and gasoline was inducted as fumigation in intake manifold at two different ratio, so that at each operation point, six cases of fuel were tested. The experimental results showed that gasoline fumigation method for both baseline fuels of diesel and B20 results in a significant increase in UHC and CO emissions, and decrease in exhaust gas temperature, smoke opacity and NO and CO2 emissions. Also, gasoline fumigation increased the brake thermal efficiency at medium and higher loads to about 5% for diesel baseline fuel, while the brake thermal efficiency decreased slightly in case of the B20 baseline fuel with gasoline fumigation. Moreover, the using B20 as an alternative fuel to diesel fuel in modes of with fumigation gasoline reduced the UHC and CO emissions, smoke opacity, exhaust gas temperature respectively to about 20.5%, 16.4%, 9% and 1.1% on average throughout engine loading. While, NO emission of B20 was up to 5% higher than diesel at modes with fumigation gasoline. Finally, all criteria of performance and emission were considered and the evaluation process done to obtain final ranking and choosing the best alternative or the best combination of fuel. From the analytical results it was determined that case of B20 with fumigation gasoline results in desirable performance and minimum emissions at some operation points.

A review of state-of-the-art practices for SSBA implementation is performed, which lays down the foundations for an upcoming framework geared towards lean manufacturing. Key SSBA planning and architecture findings are summarized. Practical evaluation of the framework in a complex information system landscape through Design Science Research (DSR) is projected with the Canadian division of an international steel parts manufacturing company

AB  - Emergency rescue facility is an essential component of urban emergency logistics system, and selection of their locations is significant for urban public safety. Urban emergency rescue facility locations (UERFLs) problem is essentially a geospatial multi-objective optimization problem (Geospatial-MOP), which presents a challenge for both researchers and managers. In this study, a user-friendly decision support tool was designed and developed for facilitating the process of optimizing UERFLs in large-scale urban areas. We described the design, architecture and implementation of the tool and its core optimization component. Based on a hypothetical case study, we introduced its functionalities as well as the decision making workflow. The results provide evidences that the tool can successfully generate Pareto-optimal frontier and capture a pool of alternative solutions to the decision maker for trade-off. This work offers new insights on promoting future urban emergency logistics management with the use of GIS and emerging artificial intelligence technologies, and makes contributions in integrating multi-objective optimization algorithm with GIS for solving geospatial multi-objective optimization problem.

AB  - Multi-criteria inventory classification groups similar items in order to facilitate their management. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and its many variants have been used extensively for this purpose. However, DEA provides only a ranking and classes are often constructed arbitrarily with percentages. This paper introduces DEASort, a variant of DEA aimed at sorting problems. In order to avoid unrealistic classification, the expertise of decision-makers is incorporated, providing typical examples of items for each class and giving the weights of the criteria with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). This information bounds the possible weights and is added as a constraint in the model. DEASort is illustrated using a real case study of a company managing warehouses that stock spare parts.

AB  - Renewable Energy System comprising of solar and wind energy, is eco-friendly, and cost-effective option for powering the rural areas compared to conventional sources. The drawback of these systems is they are less reliable as the generated power depends on meteorological conditions. A properly designed hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) that combines two or more renewable energy sources like wind turbine and solar system with battery back-up increases the reliability of these systems in standalone mode. Hence, the incorporation and collective utilization of renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly popular fields of research. A comprehensive review of various aspects of a HRES is presented in this chapter. This chapter discusses different methodologies available in the literature on feasibility analysis, optimum sizing, modelling, control aspects, and reliability issues of the HRES.

AB  - This paper brings together several contemporary topics in energy systems aiming to provide a literature review based reflection on how several interrelated energy systems can contribute together to a more sustainable world. Some directions are discussed, such as the improvement of the energy efficiency and environmental performance of systems, the development of new technologies, the increase of the use of renewable energy sources, the promotion of holistic and multidisciplinary studies, and the implementation of new management rules and "eco-friendly and sustainable" oriented policies at different scales. The interrelations of the diverse energy systems are also discussed in order to address their main social, economic and environmental impacts. The subjects covered include the assessment of the electricity market and its main players (demand, supply, distribution), the evaluation of urban systems (buildings, transportation, commuting), the analysis of the implementation of renewable energy cooperatives, the discussion of the diffusion of the electric vehicle and the importance of new bioenergy systems. This paper also presents relevant research carried out in the framework of the Energy for Sustainability (EfS) Initiative of the University of Coimbra, linking the reviewed areas to the multidisciplinary approach adopted by the EfS Initiative. To conclude, several research topics that should be addressed in the near future are proposed.

Leverage these networks as tools to carry out massive decision making processes such as the ones involved in e-democracy and e-health communities constitutes not only an extraordinary opportunity but an important research challenge. In this context issues such us influence propagation, agents interaction, and malicious users identification and isolation are key to provide successful solutions to this challenge. In this contribution we aim to address these issues by presenting a new opinion propagation network in which the influence that each agent exert with respect to their neighbours is assessed by means of a combination of the following three aspects: (i)agents’ self-confidence, (ii)inter-agents opinions similarity, (iii) the quality of the information provided by each agent, that is, the lack of contradiction also called as consistency. The proposed network allows to allocate more influence to those agents providing higher quality information and to isolate those who may present a malicious behaviour.

The model implements and solves a non-linear multi-objective, multi-pollutant decision problem where the decision variables are the application levels of emission abatement measures allowing the reduction of energy consumption, end-of pipe technologies and fuel switch options. The objectives of the decision problem are the minimization of tropospheric secondary pollution exposure and of internal costs. The model assesses CO2 equivalent emissions in order to support decision makers in the selection of win-win policies. The methodology is tested on Lombardy region, a heavily polluted area in northern Italy.

AB  - Sustainable Supply Chain have become a cornerstone to any company that seeks to achieve sustainable goals. A company's image is no longer related to the old paradigm of being sustainable in its own activities, but instead is associated with a strong collaboration between all supply chain stakeholders, towards a sustainable activity. It is then critical to create new methods and tools to account for the three pillars of sustainability: economic, environmental and social, in a multi-stakeholder chain. In this context, operational research (OR) methods play a key role in supporting sustainable supply chain activities. This paper aims to review the trends and directions of OR methods applications towards the achievement of sustainable supply chain. A set of 220 papers has been reviewed to identify the OR methods being employed, the levels of decision considered and how sustainability practices were treated through OR. We found that optimization models applied to strategic level decisions are the most preponderant studies. Moreover, it was verified that sustainability has been mainly tackled by assessing economic and environmental aspects, leaving behind the social aspects. Additionally, OR-based studies do not yet present a clear definition of sustainability, a fact that is proven by the number of environmental and social methodologies explored. Based on the major trends identified in the literature, a research framework is derived, pointing towards a future research agenda in the area.

AB  - Scholars in environmental accounting have developed many methods, capable to transform raw environmental and socio-economic data into useful information, both to protect natural ecosystems and to define the most appropriate policy and planning options to meet the existing sustainable development goals. Due to the high number of existing research challenges and needs, Beijing Normal University organized a World Summit on Environmental Accounting and Management on “Designing A Prosperous and Sustainable Future”, which was held in Beijing on July 4–6, 2016. The main topic of the conference was the inclusion of system-wide effects into on-site environmental impacts, considering an integrated environmental accounting and management framework. The outcomes of this international summit, partially represented by the papers published in this Special Volume, provide an opportunity to assess the most recent progresses in biophysical and socioeconomic accounting, as well as in modelling the impacts of anthropogenic activities on environmental and socioeconomic systems. This SV includes cutting-edge papers, that focused on promoting the theories, ideas and practices involved in ecological accounting and management. All the works are aimed to develop broader perspectives, which can be applied to ecosystem protection, as well as on planning and policy-making in view of a transition toward more sustainable and equitable societies, as indicated through the Sustainable Development Goals.

In fact, in addition to their wide expressivity, ontologies provide many reasoning abilities. Therefore, we propose to explore their maturity in dealing with the complexity of nowadays product design processes especially for the expression and execution of product and process design rules. Indeed, integrating, expressing and implementing these specific domains rules are critical issues in nowadays product development processes. The Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) is an ontological language based on OWL-DL that allows the expression of these rules. Thus, we propose an overview on the use of the OWL-DL/SWRL approach in industry and we explore the expression and execution of SWRL design rules throughout the development of an industrial case of study in the impression-die forging industry.

AB  - Accuracy analysis of parallel manipulators is the first step in selecting an appropriate error model for further design. In this paper, the kinematic accuracy of a Delta parallel manipulator is evaluated by Jacobian and geometric error models. The Jacobian (or condition number) based error models have been widely used for analysis and optimal design of parallel manipulators. However, as it is highlighted in this study, these models are dependent on the choice of particular matrix norm and do not capture the directional nature of accuracy. The geometric error model, derived for the Delta parallel manipulator, computes the exact value of positioning errors in task space that arise due to errors in joint space. The proposed model is used to compute overall as well as individual positioning errors along each DOF. It is revealed that the kinematic accuracy exhibits a highly directional nature over the reachable workspace. Moreover, individual errors along each DOF should be analyzed for complete evaluation of the accuracy of the Delta parallel manipulator.

AB  - The requirement and policy of eco-economy motivate enterprises to achieve sustainability by implementing sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). In contrast to the large amount of literature focusing on green design and green production practices, this paper pays close attention to the sustainable management practice at the bottom of the supply chain by researching sustainable recycling partner evaluation from the economic, environmental and social perspectives. To develop a feasible analytical framework for recycling partner selection, the fuzzy-based technology is applied to cope with the vague, uncertain and qualitative information. A novel integrated MCDM “fuzzy DEMATEL-AEW-FVIKOR” approach is developed to choose a best recycling partner for small-and-medium enterprises (SMEs). The combined weighting technique integrating subjective weight based on fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEDL) method with objective weight based on anti-entropy weighting (AEW) has been coupled with the fuzzy VlseKriterijuska Optimizacija I Komoromisno Resenje (FVIKOR) operations to choose the best candidate. To investigate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method, a case application has been conducted in a SME. Meanwhile, the sensitivity analysis of the method is also detected. The results argue that the best selected partner alternative keeps a high conformance with Shemshadi's and Chaghooshi's methods, and it demonstrates a strong robustness when v and φ parameters fluctuate. Besides, the proposed hybrid fuzzy DEMATEL-AEW-FVIKOR method shows its advantage in flexibility concerning the decision makers' preference.

AB  - An investigation is presented to improve on the performances of the Basic DRASTIC Framework (BDF) and its variation by the Fuzzy-Catastrophe Framework (FCF), both of which provide an estimate of intrinsic aquifer vulnerabilities to anthropogenic contamination. BDF prescribes rates and weights for 7 data layers but FCF is an unsupervised learning framework based on a multicriteria decision theory by integrating fuzzy membership function and catastrophe theory. The challenges in the paper include: (i) the study area comprises confined and unconfined aquifers and (ii) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used to run Multiple Framework (AIMF) in order to map specific vulnerability due to a specific contaminant. Predicted results by AIMF are referred to as Specific Vulnerability Indices, as the learned VIs are referenced to site-specific nitrate-N. The results show that correlation coefficient between BDF or FCF with nitrate-N is lower than 0.7 but the AIMF strategy improves it to greater than 0.95. The results are evidence for the proof-of-concept for transforming frameworks to models capable of further learning.

AB  - Cluster analysis is widely used in fields such as economics, management and engineering. The distance and correlation are two of the most important and often used mathematics- and statistics-based similarity measures in cluster analysis. Many studies have been conducted to improve the distance and similarity in high-dimensional and overlapped data. However, these studies do not consider the degree of influence (weight) of different properties on different types of data. In practice, the weight of each property is different, so these methods cannot accurately analyze real data. First, this study proposes a new distance measure that can reflect the weight, so that non-spherical overlapping data in the Euclidean space can be projected onto a weighted Euclidean space to form non-overlapping data. Second, the Fuzzy-ANP method is used to determine the weight of each factor. Then, by applying the Fuzzy-ANP-Weighted-Distance-QC (FAWQC) method to weighted random data, the effectiveness of the method is verified. Finally, the method is applied to the 2015 Economics-Energy-Environment (3E) data for 19 provinces in China for a comparative study of the classification of the system structure and evaluation of the low-carbon economy development level. The experiment results show that the FAWQC method can more accurately analyze real-world data than other methods.

AB  - The evolution of existing electricity grids to smart grids is aimed at accommodating increasing shares of renewable generation thus contributing for the de-carbonization of economy, offering more diversified services to consumers, enhancing different types of markets (energy, capacity, ancillary services) and improving the system's overall efficiency. As the economic characteristics of the electricity sector tend to discourage investments in smart grids, many countries have adopted incentive policies to foster the deployment of new technologies, which vary according to the particular characteristics of each country. Therefore, the design of specific public policies for Brazil must consider not only the motivations involved, but also the existing challenges for the implementation of smart grids and the socio-economic context. Moreover, the relevance of the proposed policies can be seen from different perspectives. This justifies the need to elicit information from multiple stakeholders for decision support purposes. This paper presents and assesses a set of policies identified by different stakeholders as having a potential to foster the development of smart grids in Brazil. The methodology to shape this set of policies consisted of a thorough literature review of international experiences, combined with meetings with experts in several domains. Then, these policies were assessed by applying a Delphi questionnaire aiming at measuring their effectiveness in fulfilling the objectives associated with investments in smart grids. A first conclusion is that all policies were assessed as having a positive impact taking into account each of the objectives, differing only in the priority to be assigned to each one. The policies that were considered more relevant were: "Incentive Policies for Promoting Demand-Side Management, Distributed Generation and Storage", "Regulatory Changes to Foster Innovation in the Energy Sector" and "Regulation of New Business Models". Among the policies with the worst scores, "Mandatory Rollout of Smart Meters" and "Establishing Quality Standards for the Telecommunications Industry" were ranked as the two lower-ranked policies, i.e., they were assigned lower priority under all objectives.

AB  - More than half a billion people will still lack reliable and affordable electricity in 2040 and around 1.8 billion may remain reliant on traditional solid biomass for cooking. Long-term energy planning could help to achieve the energy access targets in developing countries, especially in remote rural areas. Different studies exist on long-term rural electricity and thermal energy planning, but the different foci, terminology and methodologies make it difficult to track their similarities, weaknesses and strengths. With this work, we aim at providing a critical analysis of peer-reviewed studies on long-term rural energy planning, to help researchers in the field move across the diverse know-how developed in the last decades. The work resulted in the analysis of 130 studies and categorisation of 85 of them that focus on electricity, thermal energy, and oil supply in rural areas, under a number of rules clearly defined in the first part of the paper. We classify the studies in two consecutive steps, first according to their type and afterwards according to the methodology they employ to forecast the energy demand, which is one the most critical aspects when dealing with long-term rural energy planning. The work also provides specific insights, useful to researchers interested in rural energy modelling. Few studies assume a dynamic demand over the years and most of them do not consider any evolution of the future energy load, or forecast its growth through arbitrary trends and scenarios. This however undermines the relevance of the results for the purpose of long-term planning and highlights the necessity of further developing the forecasting methodologies. We conclude that bottom-up approaches, system-dynamics and agent-based models seem appropriate approaches to forecast the evolution of the demand for energy in the long-term; we analyse their potential capability to tackle the context-specific complexities of rural areas and the nexus causalities among energy and socio-economic dynamics.

AB  - The steady growth in complexity of FPGAs has led designers to rely more and more on manufacturers’ and third parties’ design tools to meet their implementation goals. However, as modern synthesis tools provide a myriad of different optimization flags, whose contribution towards each implementation goal is not clearly accounted for, designers just make use of a handful of those flags. This paper addresses the challenging problem of determining the best configuration of available synthesis flags to optimize the designer’s implementation goals. First, fractional factorial design is used to reduce the whole design space. Resulting configurations are implemented to estimate the actual impact, and statistical significance, of each considered synthesis flag. After that, multiple regression analysis techniques predict the expected outcome for each possible combination of these flags. Finally, multiple-criteria decision making techniques enable the selection of the best set of synthesis flags according to explicitly defined implementation goals.

AB  - Investors in financial markets are often at a loss when facing a huge range of products. For financial institutions also, how to recommend products to the right investors, especially those without previous investment records is problematic. In this paper, we develop and apply a personalized recommendation system for the equity funds market, based on the idea of transfer learning. First, using modern portfolio theory, a profile of equity funds and investors is created. Then, the profile of investors in the stock market is applied to the fund market by the idea of transfer learning. Finally, a utility-based recommendation algorithm based on prospect theory is proposed and the performance of the method is verified by testing it on actual transaction data. This study provides a reference for financial institutions to recommend products and services to the long tail customers.

AB  - Since managers and staff have not understood the actual consequences of risks in the food industry well, risk management methods practically are limited to identification of the type of risks. In addition, created changes in the business environment have led to change in the attitude of risk management to a process-oriented and systematic view. Because managers cannot decide based on the output of risk management process to implement improvement projects and allocate resources to them. This study has been tried to exactly identify and prioritize potential failures of the production process by using an approach based on the multi-stage Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) method and Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (PFMEA) technique with the help of the cross-functional team. In this approach, failures are prioritized according to the amount of impact of each failure on other failures, as well as the amount of three factors as severity, occurrence, and detection (outputs of PFMEA). This approach considers process-oriented view in manufacturing system through internal-stage and external-stage relationships between production process failures and covers disadvantages of traditional Risk Priority Number (RPN) score such as disregarding internal relationships between failures. Hence, prioritization of potential failures based on the score which includes RPN determinant factors and causal relationships between failures is performed using the multi-stage FCM and learning algorithm based on extended Delta rule. The results of the proposed approach’s implementation in an active company in the food industry show that prioritization of failures is closer to reality and presents more full prioritization in comparison with approaches such as traditional RPN. The real case study in the food industry has been used to show the ability of the proposed approach.

AB  - Feature selection is the process of selecting subset of features that still provide maximum amount of the information that otherwise is provided by the entire set of conditional attributes. Many approaches have been proposed so far in literature for this purpose. Recently the rough set based approaches have become dominant. Majority of these approaches use attribute dependency to find significance of attributes. Problem with this measure is that it uses positive region to calculate dependency which is a computationally expensive job. As a consequence, it degrades the performance of the feature selection algorithms using this measure. In this paper, we have proposed a new heuristic based dependency calculation technique by avoiding the positive region. The proposed method uses a heuristics approach by finding the consistent records regarding each decision class in the dataset. Using this method, allows us to calculate dependency by avoiding the positive region, which ultimately enhances the computational efficiency of the underlying feature selection algorithm thus enabling it to be used for dataset beyond smaller size. In order to calculate dependency by using the proposed method, we have used a two-dimensional grid as intermediate data structure. Number of feature selection algorithms were used with proposed solution on various publically available datasets to justify it. A comparison framework was used to compare the proposed solution with conventional methods. Results have justified the proposed solution both in terms of its efficiency and effectiveness.

AB  - Current methodologies for Information Systems (ISs) audits suffer from some limitations that could question the effectiveness of such procedures in detecting deviations, frauds, or abuses. Process Mining (PM), a set of business-process-related diagnostic and improvement techniques, can tackle these weaknesses, but literature lacks contributions that address this possibility concretely. Thus, by framing PM as an Expert System (ES) engine, this paper presents a five-step PM-based methodology for IS audits and validates it through a case in a freight export port process managed by a Port Community System (PCS), an open electronic platform enabling information exchange among port stakeholders. The validation pointed out some advantages (e.g. depth of analysis, easier automation, less invasiveness) of our PM-enabled methodology over extant ESs and tools for IS audit. The substantive test and the check on the PCS processing controls and output controls allowed to identify four major non-conformances likely implying both legal and operational risks, and two unforeseen process deviations that were not known by the port authority, but that could improve the flexibility of the process. These outcomes set the stage for an export process reengineering, and for revising the boundaries in the process flow of the PCS.

AB  - Due to the momentous effects of responsible sourcing in a firm’s performance, the sourcing process is tedious. Purchasing managers face a difficult decision in determining how to select responsible suppliers so they can maintain their firm’s competitive advantage in the contemporary business environment. Firms need to satisfy not only the views of society but also to consider the opinions of all stakeholders to stay profitable and to create a supportive business strategy. Existing studies fail to provide a model for socially responsible supplier selection, particularly when various actors are involved. To fill this gap, this study proposes a model to select the best supplier based on their corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and to identify the key actors (Shareholder, Governments, Customers, and Community) whose perspective is vital. We utilize a hybrid multi criteria decision making (MCDM) approach; however, the supplier selection portion relies on a pure decision making process with consideration of multiple criteria. This study proposes the model in three phases as follows. In the first phase, the collected common CSR practices are scrutinized through fuzzy Delphi with the assistance of experts’ opinions. In second phase, the interdependencies, interrelationship and weights of CSR practices are analysed through DEMATEL-ANP (DANP). The final phase proceeds with the selection of the best alternative (supplier) based on CSR practices through PROMETHEE. The proposed model is validated with the case illustration and the results are discussed with feedback from the case purchasing managers. Finally, the study ends by identifying managerial implications and its limitations, and we provide some useful future insights which will increase the effective integration of CSR in supply chains and especially in the supplier selection process.

This philosophy is synonymous to the way in which the human body heals and repairs itself up to a point. This article synthesises issues related to an emerging area of self-healing technologies that links software and hardware mitigations strategies. Efforts are concentrated on built-in detection, masking and active mitigation that comprises self-recovery or self-repair capability, and has a focus on system resilience and recovering from fault events. Design techniques are critically reviewed to clarify the role of fault coverage, resource allocation and fault awareness, set in the context of existing and emerging printable/nanoscale manufacturing processes. The qualitative analysis presents new opportunities to form a view on the research required for a successful integration of zero-maintenance. Finally, the potential cost benefits and future trends are enumerated.

AB  - The fundamental objective of production planning is to create a mechanism for the implementation of the mining cutoff grades and short-term production planning. One of the most important parameters in open pit design is a determination of the optimal cutoff grade. Optimum cutoff grade results in maximizing profits or maximizing the net present value. Given that in determining the cutoff grade with the goal of maximizing profits, a constant value is obtained for the entire life of the mine. The annual income of the mine will be the same throughout its lifetime, and the time value of the money has not been neglected; which is the main disadvantage of this optimization process. While in optimization with the goal of maximizing net present value, the optimal value will be a function of the time and will be greater in the early years of the mine and will gradually decrease. Optimization of cutoff grades with the aim of maximizing the net present value over the life of the mine is important due to its dependence on the economic parameters, the design of the open pit mining and fundamental issues. Maximizing the net present value is a nonlinear programming problem. To determine the optimal cutoff grade Lane method is commonly used. Lane provided his method to determine the optimal cutoff grade by considering factors such as the capacity of the mine, concentrator and load capacity of the treatment plant, the time value of money and distributing grade. The procedure of the Lane method for cutoff grade calculation is complicated and time-consuming. Considering the widespread use of heuristic methods in optimizing parameters, In the present study genetic algorithm, which is a smart algorithm, is used to determine the optimal cutoff grade. In this paper, we compare the efficiency of the genetic algorithm and Lane's theory in optimizing the degree of limit based on maximizing the net present value. Using separate programming based on the genetic algorithm and considering the capacity limitations and the proportion between the parameters of mining to smelter and refining in the mine is done. For this purpose, consider precision of 0.001%, optimum cutoff grades, the amount of output per unit and the net present value are calculated. The optimum cutoff grade at the beginning of the life of the mine is equal to 0.506% and at the end of the life of the mine to 0.222% using the genetic algorithm. Using the Lane model at the beginning of the life of the mine the optimum cut-off grade from 0/503% to 0/220% reaches at the end of the mine's life. The net present value of earnings over a lifespan of 7 years mine in the genetic algorithm and Lane model is $ 93,467,914 and $ 94,408,000 respectively. Also, the amount of mining, the amount of processing and the amount of refinery obtained by the genetic algorithm method are compared to the Lane model. The results of the research indicate high speed and very low error of genetic algorithm and also a convergence of results with the Lane method.

This model is mainly mathematically treated through fuzzy Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM) in combination with Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The fuzzy CREAM accounts the operators’ individual factors, organization factors, environmental factors and technique factors together to identify the fuzzy membership degree of each control mode and to calculate Human Error Probability (HEP). However, when the calculated HEP fails to meet the requirement, the GA will identify the target membership degree of each CREAM control mode, and adopting such target membership degree and fuzzy logic rule to generate a decision pool for safety promotion. Finally, an experts’ evaluation result based ANFIS provides a standard evaluating system for plan choice and update. The proposed model has been tested on a power supply system for an LNG terminal in Beihai China.

AB  - Increasing groundwater contamination across the globe triggered the concept of “aquifer vulnerability”, which has been extensively used worldwide during past three to four decades by researchers and policy makers for protecting groundwater from pollution. However, only a few recent studies have focused on the performance evaluation of two or more vulnerability assessment methods. Some of these studies have resulted in contrasting findings. Given this fact and considering growing threat of groundwater contamination due to increasing human activities across the globe, it is necessary to critically review existing methods, understand current research trends, and identify major challenges associated with the assessment of aquifer vulnerability. Hence, the aim of this study is to present a comprehensive review of the methods and approaches used for the evaluation of aquifer vulnerability for ‘resource’ and ‘source’ protection. First, the concept and types of aquifer vulnerability along with the definitions evolved over the years are presented, and then the methods for assessing aquifer vulnerability are suitably classified and briefly discussed. Second, the concept of vulnerability assessment for ‘source’ protection is highlighted, and the evolution of groundwater vulnerability evaluation methods is presented with an enlightening block diagram. Third, current research trends and critiques on past studies are discussed. Fourth, the major challenges of vulnerability assessment are highlighted and a way forward is suggested. It is concluded that the progress of vulnerability evaluation methods has not kept pace with the advancement of knowledge and tools/techniques. There is an urgent need for developing a scientifically robust and somewhat versatile methodology for the evaluation of ‘intrinsic’ and ‘specific’ groundwater vulnerability for ‘resource’ and ‘source’ protection under varying hydrogeologic and hydro-climatic conditions. It is emphasized that more studies should be devoted to vulnerability assessment for ‘source’ protection using ‘Source-Pathway-Receptor/Target’ approach. Also, spatial decision support systems should be developed using modern tools/techniques including artificial intelligence to improve decision-making process for protecting vital groundwater resources.

AB  - In order to choose an aircraft to operate a defined set of routes, an airline needs to consider passenger's interests in addition to its own interests. The goal of the paper is to propose a methodology which will help choose aircraft type(s) that meets the market conditions and airline's requirements best for known route network and known forecasted air travel demand by routes. Although this is a multi-criteria problem, planners usually have to make decisions under uncertainty, incorporating vagueness of human thinking. Therefore, we proposed the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) based approach. To derive crisp priorities from fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices, a logarithmic fuzzy preference programming (LFPP) method is employed, as well as an improved LFPP method. With regard to different criteria that involve quantitative and qualitative aspects, three criteria and ten sub-criteria are selected. Experts from different airlines and universities responded to an interview, contributing to the design of pairwise comparison matrices for the criteria and sub-criteria. The regional airline case study is used to show the applicability of the methodology proposed.

AB  - Cloud service selection, a promising research directive provides an intelligent solution via. service ranking based on the Quality of Service (QoS) attributes for the identification of trustworthy Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) among a wide range of functionally-equivalent CSPs. Further, the impact of objective and subjective assessment data on the accuracy of the service selection model makes the credibility of the assessment data, a major concern for the researchers in service-oriented environments. To address the challenges with respect to the identification of the user requirement compliant CSPs, data credibility, service ranking, etc. we present Hypergraph –Binary Fruit Fly Optimization based service ranking Algorithm (HBFFOA), a trust-centric approach for the identification of suitable and trustworthy cloud service providers. HBFFOA employs hypergraph partitioning, time-varying mapping function, helly property, and binary fruit fly optimization algorithm for the identification of similar service providers, credibility based trust assessment, selection of trustworthy service providers, and optimal service ranking respectively. Experiments using synthetic QoS dataset from WSDream#2 illustrates the effectiveness, practicability, scalability and computational attractiveness of HBFFOA over the existing service selection approaches in terms of precision, stability, statistical test, and time complexity analysis.

AB  - The development of better methods for the improvement of airline performance is crucial, but this type of problem is difficult to solve because of the large number of complex factors involved making this inherently a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problem. In current studies, the factors to be evaluated are considered based upon a literature review or expert opinions. This study proposes an integrated model that combines data mining and MCDM to extract the critical factors for the improvement of airline performance. We apply the dominance-based rough set approach to extract the essential factors. The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method with the concepts of the analytic network process (DANP) is then used to construct the complex evaluation system. Finally, the VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje in Serbian, meaning multicriteria optimization and compromise solution) method is applied to select the suitable improvement alternative goals with the corresponding weights provided by the DANP method. The results show that the current model can be used as the basis for a benchmark industry improvement index which can be used to evaluate each airline individually with defined planning goals to achieve financial efficiency by improving operational efficiency.

AB  - How to rapidly and accurately response to customers' demands is the key in product personalized design, which could be perfectly achieved by interactive genetic algorithm (IGA) emphasizing on collaborative interaction and user participation through human–computer interaction. However IGA widely adopted now neglects the impact of decision makers' psychological changes on decision-making behaviors. It's hard to capture customers' demands and grasp their preferences, generating slow convergence speed and heavy user fatigue. Thus an interactive genetic algorithm based on prospect theory improved with interval reference (IGA-PTIR) is proposed in the paper. In IGA-PTIR, an evolutionary individual's fitness value is represented by interval prospect value of prospect theory improved with interval reference instead of single reference in order to correct individual fitness deviation caused by ambiguity and uncertainty of user cognition. An interval number sorting strategy based on dominance degree is then adopted to rank individuals, which makes it possible to perform subsequent operations of selection, crossover and mutation. In the paper, IGA-PTIR is applied into automobile wheel hub design system and compared with traditional interactive genetic algorithms (TIGA). Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can increase convergence speed, ease user fatigue, and improve search performance to a large extent.

AB  - The polygonal fuzzy set describes a type of fuzzy information with the aid of the orderly representation of real numbers.

This research proposes the concept of an n-intuitionistic polygonal fuzzy set based on intuitionistic fuzzy and polygonal fuzzy sets. It then presents its arithmetic operation and Hamming distance formula. In addition, it adopts the standardized and weighting method to obtain the attribute matrix of the positive (negative) ideal solution, and calculates the Hamming distance between each scheme and the positive (negative) ideal solution to provide the TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution) approach for the multi-attribute decision-making problem that describes the multi-attribute index information by n-intuitionistic polygonal fuzzy set. Finally, this research implements optimized ordering on the alternative solutions according to the degree of relative similarity and verifies its effectiveness and practicability through examples.

AB  - The use of dispatching rules is one of the most popular solutions used when handling dynamic scheduling problems. However, how best to select a suitable dispatching rule or rules depends on the stochastic behavior of the performance of the system with respect to multiple conflicting attributes. Previous studies based on multi-objective optimization approaches have not explored the subjective information presented by the decision-maker in relation to the multiple impacts that arise from the decisions made using the dispatching rule. This study takes into consideration a rank-dependent utility approach combined with a multi-attribute utility theory to identify the best dispatching rule for dynamic job shop environments. An additive, non-expected, multi-attribute utility function is modeled to represent the decision-maker’s preferences and attitude to risk over the multiple stochastic consequences associated with each simulated heuristic. A numerical simulation with realistic data from a furniture hardware industry is performed to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed decision approach, and the practical issues that emerge are discussed.

AB  - Metropolitan cities in India are emerging as major economic hubs with an unprecedented land use changes and decline of environmental resources. Globalisation and consequent relaxations of Indian markets to global players has given impetus to rapid urbanisation process. Urbanisation being irreversible and rapid coupled with fast growth of population during the last century, contributed to serious ecological and environmental consequences. This necessitates monitoring and advance visualisation of spatial patterns of landscape dynamics for evolving appropriate management strategies towards sustainable development approaches. This study visualises the growth of Indian mega cities Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai and Coimbatore, through Cellular Automata Markov model considering the influence of agent(s) of urban growth through soft computing techniques. CA Markov model is considered to be one of most effective algorithm to visualise the growth of urban spatial structures. Prediction of growth using agent based modelling considering the spatial patterns of urbanisation during the past four decades has provided insights to the urban dynamics. The industrial, infrastructural, socio-economic factors significantly influence the urban growth compared to the biophysical factors. Visualisation of urban growth suggest agents driven growth in the cities and its surroundings with large land use transformations in urban corridors and upcoming Industrial and ear marked developmental zones. Integrating local agents of urban growth help in identifying specific regions of intense growth, likely challenges and provide opportunities for evolving appropriate management strategies towards sustainable cities during the 21st century.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed a huge upsurge of interest in internet of things (IoT) throughout the world. This shift has led to the emergence of new challenges associated with this novel paradigm. They all need to be addressed properly by experts and scholars in the field. In this paper, an integrated approach using fuzzy analytic network process (FANP) was applied to carry out the following tasks: first, to identify the most important IoT technology development challenges in Iran and secondly, to prioritize the aforementioned factors. The implemented approach took into account that technological factors, privacy and security issues, business related factors, legal and regulatory challenges, and cultural elements are the main factors which have an impact on IoT technology development. Besides, it was also taken into consideration that several correlations among the aforementioned classes exist. The results indicate that “technological” and “privacy and security” challenges are the most significant factors which affect IoT. Furthermore, “business model”, “architecture and design” and “education and training” were ranked as the most considerable sub-factors respectively.

AB  - A hybrid approach by combining the past performance and the envelope methods has been proposed for the selection of an ensemble of general circulation models (GCMs) of Couple Model Intercomparison phase 5 (CMIP5) for the projection of spatiotemporal changes in annual and seasonal temperatures of Iraq for four representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios. A filter known as Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU) was used to rank the GCMs considering their ability to simulate monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature for the historical period (1961–2005). The highest rank GCMs that represents the widest range of projection was then selected for the projection of temperature through statistical downscaling. A linear bias correction approach was used for the downscaling of temperature, a random forest regression was used to generate multi-model ensemble (MME) mean of projections and a quantile regression (QR) was used to assess the trends in projections at 95% level of confidence. Four GCMs namely, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5 and MIROC-ESM were found most suitable for projection of temperature of Iraq. Ensemble mean of the selected GCMs revealed increases in minimum temperatures in the range of 1.5–2.4 °C, 1.6–3.6 °C, 1.2–4.2 °C, and 1.3–6.2 °C and maximum temperatures in the range of 1.7–2.9 °C, 1.8–4.4 °C, 1.5–4.9 °C, and 1.7–6.8 °C under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively during 2070–2099. Higher increases in temperatures were projected in the north and northeast of Iraq where the average temperature is usually low, which indicates that spatial distribution of temperature would be more homogeneous in future compared to base years. The maximum temperature was found to increase more in winter while the minimum in summer. The quantile regression revealed that average summer maximum temperature may reach almost 50 °C, while the sub-zero temperature will gradually become rare during winter.

AB  - The multiple benefits of adopting distributed, green stormwater technologies in the local environment are increasingly recognised, particularly in relation to water quality, flood mitigation, amenity and aesthetics. To advance the integration of these systems into everyday decision-making practices, Planning Support Systems (PSS) are considered vital. Despite several PSS available to support planners and key decision-makers, their uptake remains constrained; a phenomenon known as the ‘implementation gap’. While scholars have hypothesised why the adoption of PSS is limited, there remains little empirical investigation regarding the reasons why. This paper tests the hypotheses underlying the implementation gap in relation to water sensitive urban design (WSUD) planning. Drawing on the tacit experience of 24 key urban water planning professionals in the front-runner city of Melbourne, Australia, in-depth semi-structured interviews were undertaken to unpack the contemporary planning processes used and reveal characteristics leading to success and failure of PSS application. Data analysis revealed WSUD planning professionals regard the adoption of PSS as a significant step towards improving contemporary decision-making practices, which are regarded as opportunistic rather than strategic. PSS use was widespread, though the type, intensity and sophistication of use varied among interview participants. Confirming the hypotheses from planning literature, practitioners suggested PSS need to be user-friendly and align closely to planning practice. Additionally, however, it was found that it is crucial for PSS to meet industry conventions. Suggested improvements to current PSS included incorporating socio-economic factors alongside biophysical and planning factors, hence the role for GIS-based suitability analysis tools. Overall, this study provides current and future PSS-developers with critical insights regarding the type, function and characteristics of an ‘ideal’ PSS aimed at enhancing the usefulness and uptake of PSS, and thus improve planning that supports expediting green infrastructure implementation.

However, analyzing spatial data is exhaustive due to its details as it is related to locations with a special representation such as longitude and latitude. This paper aims at proposing an approach for applying data mining techniques over spatial data to find trends in the data for decision support. Basic information considering spatial data is presented with presenting the proposed approach aiming to be applied in the Egyptian organizations to prove its applicability.

AB  - This study suggests a patent-based methodology for identifying emerging technologies by combining a retrospective technological feature analysis and a prospective market-needs analysis. To do this, first, the candidate promising technologies were identified by applying bibliographic coupling to patents, thus producing a list of outlier patents. Then, the measures to evaluate both technological and market characteristics of the candidate technologies were developed, where retrospective patent analysis and sentiment analysis on customer opinions are required. Finally, the candidate technologies are mapped onto two-dimensional space according to the values of the two measures; the final promising technologies are determined to be those that have high values for either technological characteristics or market characteristics. The suggested methodology was applied to an automobile industry, through which its feasibility and usability were verified. This study is one of the few studies to develop technology-evaluation measures based on an ad-hoc analysis of technological characteristics. In addition, it attempts to link patent databases to market databases, aiming to directly reflect customer needs to evaluate the potential of a technology in a market. The approach suggested in this study can be applied to recent patents with little citation information for assessing their value to be deemed as promising technologies; this is expected to contribute both academically and practically to the existing literature on patent analysis.

AB  - A bi-objective Fuel efficient Green Vehicle Routing Problem (F-GVRP) with varying speed constraint is discussed in this paper as an extension of Green Vehicle Routing Problem (G-VRP). F-GVRP is modelled to minimize both route cost and fuel consumption using goal programming. The problem is solved using Particle Swarm Optimization with Greedy Mutation Operator and Time varying acceleration coefficient (TVa-PSOGMO). The objective of this paper is to study the behaviour of F-GVRP under varying speed environment and its impact on the route cost and fuel consumption. Experiments are conducted with constant and varying speed constraints and it is observed that better routing plan with minimum fuel consumption can be achieved under varying speed environment.

KW  - Design and optimization of impeller blades
AB  - Mixed Flow pumps are a combination of both axial and radial flow pumps. In present days they are having a wide range of applications. The impeller blade designing of mixed flow pump has always been a difficult task, the reason being it requires a lot of designing parameter to be considered for successful designing. When compared with radial and axial flow turbo-machines the mixed flow type of turbo-machines always get less importance for these complexities in their designing process. This complexity arises because of the complicated blade and geometry of fluid flow passage. Impeller is considered as one of the most important components in a mixed flow pump for the flow passage. The main motive behind the study of impeller blade design is to cite the reasons for the low hydraulic performance of the pump originally taken into consideration. When the pump is in functioning or operating condition, the rotation of the impeller provides with a geometric shape and the passage of flow gets distorted. It has been observed that all the available designs of the mixed flow pump, impeller blades are designed with a constant semi-cone angle, where as various data books for pump model test signify the fact that the semi-cone angle for these impeller blades can vary a specified range. So it is always an option to verify the fact that if variation of semi-cone angle in this specified range affects the designing parameters or not. From the literature survey it is found that various design methods such as Fourier expansion singularity method, free vortex method, mean stream line theory method, inverse time marching method, the pseudo-stream function method etc., adapted by various researchers, but the design methodology is always a tedious task.Here the authors have proposed the blade designs with a variation of semi-cone at hub.The concepts of Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulic Machines play a vital role in this designing process. Further taking the Hydraulic loading into consideration analysis is done to obtain the possible designs for the impeller blades. Finally optimization is carried out and the optimized design (blade with optimal geometry) is obtained with a varying semi-cone angle taking Hydraulic Loading into consideration.

AB  - As with most emerging technologies, nanotechnologies present uniquely challenging risks with many unknown variables. These challenges are complicated by the fact that there are few risk-related forecasts that have been scientifically confirmed. Further complications derive from the uniquely complex physical and chemical nature of nanomaterials. A new materials science is emerging, and reliable risk information is critically needed to codify it. This is particularly true for insurance of nanomaterial research and development – from small business use to large academic and industrial applications. Since the last iteration of this chapter, the nanomaterial insurance industry has made strides to develop insurance mechanisms for nanotechnology companies and related organizations. This chapter details a recent history of nanomaterial insurance, including recent perspectives from the European Union and the United States. Further, this chapter discusses various future paths for nanomaterial insurance, as well as perspectives regarding how nanomaterial insurers and risk assessors may analyze and assess risk within an environment of incomplete information and uncertainty. As the field continues to mature and develop, the role of nanomaterial insurance and risk assessment will become increasingly important to underwrite business operations in various sectors.

AB  - Airport is a main infrastructure with the risk of danger and catastrophic damages throughout its activities. These dangers can lead to heavy financial damages and casualties. Thus, identification and prioritization of airport risks and their impact on the system are issues by which the airport management can plan control measures in order to increase safety and to improve system performance. In this regard, this study tries to provide a new decision-making approach to prioritize airport risks in order to consider the cause-effect relationships between risks and their relationships with system objectives that indeed reflect the performance of the airport. Proposed decision-making approach uses fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) method and slack-based data envelopment analysis (SBDEA). So that, at first, cognitive map is drawn for airport risks and system objectives (measurement factors); Then, the impact of each risk on measurement factors is evaluated using learning algorithm based on extended Delta rule and risks are prioritized using SBDEA model without outputs. In the proposed decision-making approach, airport risks are considered as alternatives and the impact of each risk on measurement factors (the output of learning algorithm) are considered as evaluation criteria. Results of using proposed approach in Urmia International Airport located at northwestern in Iran show that risks including: “Lack of staff training”, “Inappropriate ground handling” and “Inoperable navigation aid (NAVAID)” are the main risks in this airport.

AB  - One of the challenges that have gained industry's attention is assessing supply chain risks with increasing exposure to disruptions, it is vital for supply chains to manage risks proactively. Across industries, one-third of all supply chains fail to manage risk on a formal basis. The story is slightly worse for automotive companies, with 37 percent acknowledging no formal practices for monitoring risk. Automotive companies trail top supply chains in implementing risk management practices. Prediction of potential failure points and overall impact of these risks is challenging. In this research, we aim to assess the major risks that are encountered in supply chain of automobile industry. The purpose of this paper is to develop a holistic, systematic and quantitative risk assessment for measuring the overall risk behavior. We have used FAHP modeling and further analysis is carried out using Chang’s Extent Analysis Technique. A systematically developed design can be employed to capture the dynamic behavior of risks.

These domains are primarily concentrated within nonprofit services and local development. However, there are many other disciplines and application areas for which novel applications and extensions of Community OR could generate valuable insights. This paper identifies a number of these, distinguishing between ‘emerging trends’ (mostly in well-studied areas of operational research, management science and analytics) and ‘new frontiers’, which can be found in traditions not commonly oriented towards empirical and analytical methods for problem solving, where community-engaged decision modeling represents new ways of generating knowledge, policies and prescriptions. This paper will show how the exploration of emerging trends and new frontiers in Community OR can provide a basis for the development of innovative research agendas that can broaden the scope and impact of the decision sciences.

AB  - Hybrid solar power plants which combine concentrated solar power (CSP) and photovoltaic (PV) systems with thermal energy storage (TES) have the potential to provide cost competitive and dispatchable renewable energy. The integration of energy storage gives dispatchability to the variable renewable generation while the combination of different generation technologies can reduce the costs. However, the design of reliable and cost competitive hybrid solar power plants requires the careful balancing of trade-offs between financial and technical performance. This is made more complicated by the dependence on a larger number of parameters compared to conventional plants and due to the integration of TES which requires that the operational profile is optimised for every design. This contribution presents a two-stage, multi-objective optimisation framework which combines multi-objective linear programming methods for the operational optimisation with multi-objective genetic algorithms for the design optimisation. The operational optimisation which is performed for every design point needs to be performed with linear programming methods. Here an automated scalarisation method is developed for the linear programming method which enables the multi-objective optimisation of the operational profile. This enables the evaluation of the trade-offs between financial and technical performance in both the design and operational optimisation, which is required to design reliable and cost competitive sustainable energy systems. The two-stage multi-objective optimisation is applied to analyse and improve the design of the hybrid solar power plant Atacama-1. It is demonstrated that balancing the trade-off between financial and technical performance is key to increase the competitiveness of solar energy and that it is possible to simultaneously increase dispatchability and decrease the levelised cost of energy. This shows that the operational and design optimisations have to be directly linked in order to exploit the synergies of hybrid systems. Thus the optimisation framework presented in this study can improve the decision making in the design of hybrid solar power plants.

AB  - In order to reach the goal of sustainability, eco-innovation has been proposed as an effective mechanism and solution to help enterprises to reduce negative impacts on environment. However, with the advance of technology, the scope of eco-innovation becomes larger and complicated. In the past, very few articles discussed the evolution of technologies involving eco-innovation integratedly and systematically. It is worth to have a systematic review concerning the state of the art. The purpose of this study was to provide a holistic view to see the progression of the technologies which pushed forward the realization of sustainability in the past 2-3 decades. In this study, 55 research review papers were initially selected and analyzed to identify the technologies involving eco-innovation. Four technology-based eco-innovation dimensions were defined (green/sustainable product development dimension, business model integration dimension, green marketing and sustainable consumption dimension, and hybrid model construction and optimization dimension). Five case studies in the prior research were re-evaluated based on the identified technology-based eco-innovation dimensions. The results showed that most companies performed the best for the green/sustainable product development dimension. New technology and directions are needed for enterprises to strengthen the other three dimensions. Therefore, additional 76 papers were analyzed to provide suggestions concerning future technology directions for enterprises moving towards sustainability.

AB  - Clinical practice guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations. However, many problems are reported, such as contradictions and inconsistencies. For example, guidelines recommend sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in child sinusitis, but they also state that there is a high bacteria resistance in this context. In this paper, we propose a method for the semi-automatic detection of inconsistencies in guidelines using preference learning, and we apply this method to antibiotherapy in primary care. The preference model was learned from the recommendations and from a knowledge base describing the domain. We successfully built a generic model suitable for all infectious diseases and patient profiles. This model includes both preferences and necessary features. It allowed the detection of 106 candidate inconsistencies which were analyzed by a medical expert. 55 inconsistencies were validated. We showed that therapeutic strategies of guidelines in antibiotherapy can be formalized by a preference model. In conclusion, we proposed an original approach, based on preferences, for modeling clinical guidelines. This model could be used in future clinical decision support systems for helping physicians to prescribe antibiotics.

KW  - Data quality
AB  - The social housing sector has yet to realise the potential of high data quality. While other businesses, mainly in the private sector, reap the benefits of data quality, the social housing sector seems paralysed, as it is still struggling with recent government regulations and steep revenue reduction. This paper offers a succinct review of relevant literature on data quality and how it relates to social housing. The Housing and Development Board in Singapore offers a great example on how to integrate data quality initiatives in the social housing sector. Taking this example, the research presented in this paper is extrapolating cross-disciplinarily recommendations on how to implement data quality initiatives in social housing providers in the UK.

AB  - Manual testing is still a predominant and an important approach for validation of computer systems, particularly in certain domains such as safety-critical systems. Knowing the execution time of test cases is important to perform test scheduling, prioritization and progress monitoring. In this work, we present, apply and evaluate ESPRET (EStimation and PRediction of Execution Time) as our tool for estimating and predicting the execution time of manual test cases based on their test specifications. Our approach works by extracting timing information for various steps in manual test specification. This information is then used to estimate the maximum time for test steps that have not previously been executed, but for which textual specifications exist. As part of our approach, natural language parsing of the specifications is performed to identify word combinations to check whether existing timing information on various test steps is already available or not. Since executing test cases on the several machines may take different time, we predict the actual execution time for test cases by a set of regression models. Finally, an empirical evaluation of the approach and tool has been performed on a railway use case at Bombardier Transportation (BT) in Sweden.

AB  - Governments and privately-held utilities will have to drastically reduce their carbon emissions to mitigate climate change. Such reductions will require transitioning electrical infrastructure to rely on cleaner fuels and power-generation technologies. Despite the myriad factors influencing both the process and eventual outcome of these transitions, it is typically transitions' cost and individuals’ willingness to pay (WTP) for them that dominate both strategic planning and political discourse. Studies used to calculate the public's WTP however often rely on vague policy options, ignore important social and environmental attributes, and fail to provide individuals means for engaging tradeoffs. Here we report on three studies that provided individuals multiple choice tasks for evaluating real-world portfolio options across key social and environmental attributes. Our results show that individuals placed high importance on minimizing costs, yet also consistently ranked strategies highest that reduced both greenhouse gas (GHG) and air particulate emissions, even when those portfolios require considerable cost increases. When provided an opportunity to construct their own portfolios, participants again constructed costly portfolios that significantly reduced both GHG emissions and air pollution. Using multiple choice tasks, we demonstrated individuals’ WTP for low-emission energy strategies to be higher than previous studies relying on contingent valuation suggest.

AB  - Background
Successful development of new treatments for rare diseases (RDs) and their sustainable patient access require overcoming a series of challenges related to research and health technology assessment (HTA). These impediments, which may be unique to RDs or also apply to common diseases but are particularly pertinent in RDs, are diverse and interrelated.
Objective
To develop for the first time a catalog of primary impediments to RD research and HTA, and to describe the cause and effect of individual challenges.
Methods
Challenges were identified by an international 22-person expert working group and qualitative outreach to colleagues with relevant expertise. A broad range of stakeholder perspectives is represented. Draft results were presented at annual European and North American International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) congresses, and written comments were received by the 385-strong ISPOR Rare Disease Review Group from two rounds of review. Findings were refined and confirmed via targeted literature search.
Results
Research-related challenges linked to the low prevalence of RDs were categorized into those pertaining to disease recognition and diagnosis, evaluation of treatment effect, and patient recruitment for clinical research. HTA-related challenges were classified into issues relating to the lack of a tailored HTA method for RD treatments and uncertainty for HTA agencies and health care payers.
Conclusions
Identifying and highlighting diverse, but interrelated, key challenges in RD research and HTA is an essential first step toward developing implementable and sustainable solutions. A collaborative multistakeholder effort is required to enable faster and less costly development of safe, efficacious, and appropriate new RD therapies that offer value for money.

AB  - Many decisions can be analyzed and supported by quantitative models. These models tend to be complex psychologically in that they require the elicitation and combination of quantities such as probabilities, utilities, and weights. They may be simplified so that they become more transparent, and lead to increased trust, reflection, and insight. These potential benefits of simplicity should be weighed against its potential costs, notably possible decreases in performance. We review and synthesize research that has used mathematical analyses and computer simulations to investigate if and when simple models perform worse, equal, or better than more complex models. Various research strands have pursued this, but have not reached the same conclusions: Work on frequently repeated decisions as in inference and forecasting—which typically are operational and involve one or a few decision makers—has put forth conditions under which simple models are more accurate than more complex ones, and some researchers have proposed that simple models should be preferred. On the other hand, work on more or less one-off decisions as in preference and multi-criteria analysis—which typically are strategic and involve group decision making and multiple stakeholders—has concluded that simple models can at best approximate satisfactorily the more complex models. We show how these conclusions can be reconciled. Additionally, we discuss the theory available for explaining the relative performance of simple and more complex models. Finally, we present an aid to help determine if a simple model should be used, or not, for a particular type of decision problem.

AB  - Exploratory modelling is an approach for modelling under uncertainty based on the generation and analysis of computational experiments. The results of exploratory modelling are sensitive to the way that experiments are designed, such as the way that the uncertainty space is delineated. This article introduces an agent-monitored framework—i.e. a design metaphor of the interactions among modellers and stakeholders and the simulation process—for controlling the design of experiments based on monitoring model behaviour in the output space. To demonstrate the benefits of the suggested framework in the exploratory modelling process, the article shows how the use of the framework with an output-oriented approach informs the delineation of an appropriate uncertainty space with an illustrative example in the decision-making context. The article concludes that the design of experiments based on feedback from the output space can be a useful approach: to control simulations in exploratory modelling; to build more confidence in final results; and to inform the design of other aspects of experiments, such as selecting policy levers and sampling method.

AB  - The aim of this research is to determine the land suitability for cultivating citrus in Fars province, Iran. To reach the mentioned aim, a fuzzy method and order weight average (OWA) methods are used for preparing the fuzzy map of each parameter in GIS. At first, some parameters like the water availability (well, spring and river), roads network, aspect, elevation, slope, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, sunshine hours, and growing degree days (GDD) were used as input data. After preparing the interpolation map by using IDW, fuzzy map was prepared for each layer by using the fuzzy membership function. Then based on the importance degree of each data, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method is applied to determine each layer weight and land suitability map. Consequently, the study area is classified into 56.16% as not suitable, 7.69% as low suitable, 25.41% as medium suitable and 10.75% as suitable. Also the results of OWA showed that with increasing risk (no trade-off), all of the study area had good condition for citrus cultivation. In addition, with decreasing risk (no trade-off), almost all of the study area had not suitable for citrus cultivation.

AB  - Recently, the combined mechanism of energy absorption has been considered for increasing energy absorption efficiency. The combined deformation of circumferential expansion and folding in the cylindrical aluminum thin-walled tubes is one of these mechanisms that can be effective in improving energy absorption. In this paper, the effect of parameters of diameter, height and thickness of the tube, friction, and interference of the tube and punch, as well as the half-angle of the tip of the conical punch on the energy absorption have been investigated using LS_Dyna software. Taguchi method was used to design the experiments and response surface method was used for optimization. In the Taguchi method, the design limit has been significantly reduced and the effect of different parameters on energy absorption has been demonstrated. In optimization with response surface method, optimal states have been proposed that increased energy absorption compared to reference test. Finally, by providing a mathematical model for single-objective optimization, the specific energy absorption increased by 127%, but the maximum force in this case was increased by 130%. In multi-objective optimization, specific energy absorption and maximum force were considered as design parameters that optimized specific energy absorption increased by 77%, while the maximum force was only 37% higher. Thus, by combining suitable types of energy absorption mechanisms and optimizing them, absorbents with a higher specific energy absorption capacity and lower maximum force were designed.

AB  - The Internet of Things needs for computing power and storage are expected to remain on the rise in the next decade. Consequently, the amount of data generated by devices at the edge of the network will also grow. While cloud computing has been an established and effective way of acquiring computation and storage as a service to many applications, it may not be suitable to handle the myriad of data from IoT devices and fulfill largely heterogeneous application requirements. Fog computing has been developed to lie between IoT and the cloud, providing a hierarchy of computing power that can collect, aggregate, and process data from/to IoT devices. Combining fog and cloud may reduce data transfers and communication bottlenecks to the cloud and also contribute to reduced latencies, as fog computing resources exist closer to the edge. This paper examines this IoT-Fog-Cloud ecosystem and provides a literature review from different facets of it: how it can be organized, how management is being addressed, and how applications can benefit from it. Lastly, we present challenging issues yet to be addressed in IoT-Fog-Cloud infrastructures.

To this end, we propose a multi-echelon humanitarian logistic network that considers the location of central warehouses, managing the inventory of perishable products in the pre-disaster phase, and routing the relief vehicles in the post-disaster phase. An epsilon-constraint method, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), and a modified NSGA-II called reference point based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (RPBNSGA-II) are proposed to solve this mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to analyze the results showing that NSGA-II performs better than the other algorithms with small size problems while RPBNSGA-II outperforms the other algorithms with large size problems.

These processes are capable of generating intricate and complex shapes with high degree of accuracy, close dimensional tolerance and better surface finish. In this paper, a decision guidance framework is developed in Visual BASIC 6.0 to help the process engineers in selecting the most appropriate NTM process for a specific work material and shape feature combination. It also assists in identifying the ideal process parameter combinations for the most suitable NTM process. The derived results highly corroborate with the opinions of the experts in the related field, demonstrating the acceptability of the developed system.

AB  - The social capital selection is one of the most important issues in public-private partnership project of electrochemical storage power station. However, two problems reducing the decision-making rationality and accuracy exist in the present multi-criteria decision analysis. First, the existing evaluation index system does not can reflect the technological characteristics of electrochemical storage power station; second, some information distortion and loss are caused by the uncertainty in the evaluation values and the criteria weights. In order to overcome these deficiencies, the innovations of this paper are as follows: ①this paper built a social capital selection evaluation index system specifically targeted at electrochemical storage power station, the results of social capital selection are more in line with the actual needs of power station construction and operation; ② trapezoidal interval type-2 hesitant fuzzy number as the mathematics symbol of linguistic terms are used to established a evaluation model, which can balance the convenience of opinion expression and the accuracy of evaluation value; ③ the maximizing deviations principle was used to handle the interval weights under the linguistic environment, it not only allowed the experts to express subjective weights as possible as they can, but also realized objective weights’ information mining by using the deviations of evaluation data. The aforementioned innovations together constitute a social capital selection framework of electrochemical storage power station. Finally, the effectiveness of decision framework was verified based on a case study of China.

Various methods have been proposed for estimating the stage-discharge curves in open channels, including the model of Ahmadi et al. (2017) in which the rating curve was identified by utilizing the information of discharge at a referenced water level. In the present study, a novel approach was taken to improve that model by modifying its basic assumptions and employing multi-objective optimization. To this end, multivariate relationships were presented to determine the actual mean velocity in the flow cross-section. The unknown exponents of the proposed relationships were obtained by using the second version of the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2), and the appropriate equation was selected by applying the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) approach. The validity of the proposed method was assessed across 6 artificial and 6 natural hydraulic cross-sections. Results showed a close agreement between the estimated and observed data. In the next step, the results of the proposed method were compared with those of the previous model using the Mann-Whitney U test. The results demonstrated that the proposed model was more efficient than the previous one.

AB  - The concept of stall lift robustness for high-lift device (HLD) measures the stability of lift values under a series of angles of attack (AoA) around stall, which plays a significant role in flight safety. In this article, a stall lift robustness design with the consideration of aerodynamic constraints (stall AoA, average lift, etc.) is carried out, where design targets are set as a series of lift values on Lift-AoA curve. A Principle Component Analysis (PCA)–Artificial Neutral Network (ANN)-based inverse design model is introduced. The design targets are transformed by PCA for data dimension reduction. Then, the new set of design targets are input into the surrogate model of ANN, and corresponding geometry of new HLD is predicted. The ANN is constructed through database and sample points are screened considering lift unsteadiness. The design procedure is iterated to meet the design accuracy. The process of stall lift robustness design with the proposed model is discussed in this article, and the design results are validated by Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES).

AB  - Developing computer aided tools for process design is of paramount importance in the transition toward a more sustainable chemical industry. In this work, we present a framework to incorporate sustainability principles in the design of chemical processes that combines a palette of tools, including life cycle assessment, surrogate modeling, objective reduction, multi-objective optimization and data envelopment analysis (DEA). The latter methodology facilitates the post-optimal analysis of the Pareto front by narrowing down the number of designs and ranking them without the need to define weights in an explicit manner. DEA provides in turn improvement targets for the suboptimal alternatives that if attained would make them optimal, thereby guiding retrofit efforts toward the most effective actions based on benchmarking them against the best technologies available. The capabilities of the framework are demonstrated in a case study based on the production of methanol from CO2 and hydrogen.

AB  - Building envelope parameters and geometric configurations can considerably influence the building energy performance. However, determining the best trade-offs of different building shape and envelope configurations to yield near-optimal design alternatives with respect to their energy performance is not a straight-forward task. Consequently, different methods have been utilized to optimize building envelope parameters and geometric configurations to achieve better energy performance. The objective of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the optimization methods and their application in energy-efficient architectural building design to better identify the potentials and applicability of different optimization methods. This paper reviews the optimization research, where building envelope parameters and geometric configurations are considered remarkably as the optimization independent variable(s) and building energy consumption/demand is included as an objective in the optimization process. The associated derivative-free and derivative-based optimization methods and their application in energy-efficient building design are included in this review. In addition, decision-making approaches are discussed for multi-objective optimizations. Current optimization tools are demonstrated. Finally, crucial considerations, including limitations and suggestions for the related future studies are concluded.

AB  - Waste management has still been a developing and progressing field, which demands continual improvements in waste transportation as well as proper selection of locations and technical operation of new treatment facilities. Most of research papers on waste management planning have been dealing with optimisation of network flows, thus minimising the cost and improving economic criteria. The shortest paths to treatment facilities are considered together with detailed analysis of their operation including heat and electricity demands in their vicinity. The tasks sometimes include social and global environmental criterions, however, the direct local consequences also play an important role and should be examined. A decision-making strategy in waste management updated with the local emission impact on the population is proposed in this paper. The paper focuses on the first move in analysing the production, dispersion, and impact of pollutants, originating in transport, with regards to the population living close to routes. The calculation of emission produced during the transport of waste takes into consideration the altitude profiles of routes, container loads, and specific types of vehicles. The consecutive estimated impact on the population reckons with the distances between routes and municipalities as well as their sizes in terms of the numbers of inhabitants, where the transportation routes are divided into smaller segments and dispersion is limited with threshold value. The proposed approach describing the emission effect has been tested using real-life operating data corresponding to the specific, 81 km long route along which approximately 25 t of waste is transported 800 times a year. The impact of pollutants on the population was evaluated and discussed. Results of the analysis were quantified for this route to create an edge characterisation needed for further calculations. This approach applied to the whole network then yields input data needed for future research of novel strategies in facility location problems. Other possible extensions of the presented approach include more accurate dispersion function or detailed calculation of the impact of pollutants with respect to specific locations of residential houses.

AB  - Summary
The constant development of health technologies, combined with the increase in the cost of treatment, means that States must continually make choices about the introduction of new technologies into their healthcare system and how they are to be funded. In France, the systematic participation of patients in these processes is one of the targets to be met in terms of healthcare democracy. Although, on an international level, patient involvement in these assessments is constantly growing, it is difficult to define due to the presence of unstabilised elements in terms of both terminology and assessment methods. As a result, patient and public involvement in health technology assessments varies considerably from one country to the next, from one field to the next and even from one type of technology to the next. Several types of involvement exist, ranging from studies conducted to collect patient “insight” (experience, perception, needs, preferences, attitudes to treatment and health, etc.) to processes aimed at including patients in assessments (as individuals, as representatives of associations, etc.). Given the scope and complexity of the subject, and the difficulty involved in understanding all the different aspects of health technologies and innovations, the members of the Round Table chose to concentrate on health technology assessments (medicinal products and medical devices) to develop national recommendations on all possible types of patient involvement in the health technology assessment processes conducted by the health authorities in France.

This research aims to categorize AI factors and examine its relative importance for better implementation in manufacturing industries. The relative importance and ranking of AI factors in manufacturing industry was done through a literature review, discussion with experts, and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach. In all, 13 IA factors were identified and further divided into three factor categories. Then their prioritization was done using AHP approach to assign the relative importance of these 13 factors affecting the industrial automation in manufacturing industries. The result will help the manufacturing industry mangers to work upon them based on their relative importance to improve their industrial automation performance. Finally, limitations, managerial implications, and scope of future study are presented at the end of the paper.

AB  - New industrial revolution, called Industry 4.0, is based on the evolution of information and communication technology. It creates new challenges for the scientific and industrial community, but it also creates a specific challenge to demonstrate this new industrial platform in the learning factory environment. A significant and interesting topic for a demonstration of Industry 4.0 is to track the manufacturing execution by using the RFID (radio-frequency identification) system. Thus, creating a system called RFID-enabled Manufacturing Execution System (MES). RFID technology is interesting, because it enables, not just identification of some product like barcode technology, but also writing the data on the RFID tag attached to the product (data about process times, ERP product data, or similar). This kind of live tracking of manufacturing execution can significantly improve production planning, especially for the small-lot and single-item production. Learning factories are, in the most cases, oriented to this type of production. However, RFID technology has its limitations. In this research, a performance of the industrial RFID system has been experimentally tested. Presented results give guidelines for the design of the intelligent assembly line in the learning factory at University of Split, regarding the limitations of the RFID systems.

AB  - The rise of digitization in Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) using Commercial Off-The-Shelf software has stimulated the use of existing IT security solutions. This trend involves serious risks, due to the unsuitability of most existing IT security solutions to ICSs environments. The aim of this study is to prevent Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems’ (IDPSs) behaviors from degrading the QoS of data transfers between time sensitive subsystems of ICSs. Facilities such as Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) often have systems using Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS), which have to be response-time deterministic. A module is designed based on the utilization law, queuing theory, and a heuristic algorithm in order to evaluate and propose the optimal security policy and configuration for each role representing a machine. The crux of this approach is that the module integrated with the IDPS, solve an optimization problem using the Bat algorithm to generate a Pareto set of optimal solutions and propose the best one that will guarantee the security required for a role, while maintaining QoS (i.e. response time inferior to the Worst Case Execution Time (WCET)). MATLAB is used to simulate the proposed method. The results show that the IDPS efficiently selects the best security policies for all active roles and minimize the chances of WCET violations, thus, avoid any undesirable effects. As shown in the simulation scenarios, the module was able to propose a policy which represents an optimal solution where the security strength value is 0.68942 and the response time is 0.219015 s. Moreover, in the second scenario, even though the first run did not find any optimal solution, the improvement introduced using the urgency flag, solve the problem and propose a security policy for the role under evaluation. Therefore, the approach guarantees the maximum security possible without violating the WCET of roles. The study sheds light on the deficiencies and weaknesses of security systems in some demanding environments. Security policies might be a hindrance to these types of security systems when stringent constraints (e.g. real time response) are imposed. Consequently, the proposed method mitigating the issue would be a major contribution to the Information Communication Technology security field, if integrated with IDPSs designed to protect time sensitive ICSs using ROTSs. Moreover, it provides a much-needed approach to help guarantee real-time, deterministic performance, and security requirements needed by time sensitive systems.

An uncertain behavioral decision making method is proposed in this paper. The confidence of the vehicle’s current state relative to the boundary condition of the behavior decision is taken as the judgment basis of the decision. The Bayesian reasoning method and the DS evidence theory are integrated to solve the problem that the boundary of the finite state machine is too clear and the behavior mode switching is more mechanical to a certain extent.

AB  - The development of wind farm projects requires proper planning and evaluation. Most often, the suitability of locations for siting wind farms is based on the wind resource (i.e. wind speeds) of a location. However, other criteria such as environmental, economic, and social factors are also important during the planning stage at arriving at a robust wind farm siting decision. In this paper, a geographic information system-based model for wind farm site selection using interval type-2 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is proposed and implemented to determine the suitable wind farm sites in Nigeria. The model focuses on the use of fuzzy sets to represent expert’s linguistic judgement with the aim of addressing the issues of uncertainty, vagueness and inconsistency in wind farm site selection decision making. The model uses two sets of criteria (weighted and constraint) which are either economic, social, or environmental in evaluating the suitable sites for wind farm development. The results of the study revealed that the best sites for wind farm development are basically located in the Northern part of Nigeria with Bauchi, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Plateau, and Sokoto states being the most suitable locations for wind farm projects. The suitable area for locating wind farm in the country is evaluated to be approximately 125728.6 km2, out of which about 2650.1 km2 are considered to be extremely suitable for siting a wind farm. This paper could serve as a first-hand scientific information for decision makers and planners in selecting the optimal suitable site for wind farm development. Although, Nigeria is considered as the case study, the methodology can be severally applied to any region in the world.

Engineering technology education focuses on providing more specialized and applied engineering education, as opposed to theoretical knowledge. Consequently, institutions providing engineering technology education curricula need to develop applied courses that take advantage of recent advancements in automation, information and communication technologies to show integration, interoperability, modularity and flexibility in modern manufacturing environments. Since the late 1990s, the reconfigurable manufacturing paradigm has been introduced to extend the flexibilities and capabilities of modern manufacturing systems. Unfortunately, in scientific literature, there is still a lack of works that describe success stories related to the application of the reconfigurable manufacturing paradigm in engineering technology education. This article provides a case study that takes advantage of the reconfigurable manufacturing paradigm to introduce students to the complex tasks of design and operation of reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS). The article describes how a course is designed based on project management methodology in order to get students faced with the complexity of designing, implementing, assessing the performance and operating an RMS.

AB  - A pronounced gap often exists between expected and actual building performance. The multi-faceted and cross lifecycle causes of this performance gap are found in design assumptions, construction issues and commissioning and operational compromises. Some important factors are firmly rooted in the lack of interoperability around building information. New solutions to the interoperability challenge offer the potential to leverage and reuse available heterogeneous data in a manner that can significantly assist building performance assessment. Linked data provides an open, modular and extensible solution for the challenge. However, in the buildings domain, the integration of rule-based performance metrics and contextual information has yet to be formally established. This paper describes an approach to the provision of in-depth building performance assessment through the integration of OpenMath and linked data. An ontology describing performance metrics in RDF is presented, together with an automated metric evaluation solution using multi-silo queries and computer algebra systems, providing a flexible, automated and extensible mechanism for the assessment of building performance. Building managers and engineers can simultaneously analyse time-series building performance at a range of levels, without burdensome manual intervention such as is the case with traditional solutions. A test implementation on a large university building highlights the potential of this solution.

AB  - Dams are critical infra-structures whose their failure could leads to high economic and social consequences. For this reason, application of quantitative risk analysis has gained extensive attention in recent years. Dam safety management has become an indispensable part of all dam engineering projects worldwide. The concept of risk is heavily tied to probabilistic methods. From an engineering point of view, a clear definition of the terminologies involved in dam safety, and a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the current literature are the starting points towards an effective risk-based approach. The first part of this paper provides a systematic review on the fundamental elements in uncertainty quantification. Then, different terminologies in risk-based dam safety are explored and their inter-connections are discussed. More than 350 papers are summarized, and several tables and conceptual plots are used for extra clarification. Since no such a paper is ever published, hopefully this can unify all the future activities and improves our understanding from probabilistic risk analysis.

AB  - The substandard condition of wastewater systems in the US, accompanied by the lack of financial resources for renewal are hindering adequate operation and maintenance of deficient sewer systems. Information about current and future pipe condition, as well as information about the impact of possible pipe failures are an integral part of an efficient asset management program and can help stakeholders make the best decisions to prioritize rehabilitation and/or replacement projects. Typically, pipes in the worst structural conditions are prioritized and budgeted within the capital improvement project planning. To be able to predict future pipe conditions, many methods have been developed and successfully implemented that incorporate pipe inspection data to predict the future state of these assets. Additionally, methodologies exist for determining the consequences of pipe failures economically, socially, and environmentally. These methods have been incorporated into decision support systems (DSS) that help utility managers determine when to rehabilitate or replace their assets. DSS for trenchless pipe renewal allow utility managers to determine the most suitable method to renew their assets, given known defects in the pipe. The aim of this paper is to provide a review of risk management methods that allow pipeline managers to estimate likelihood of failure and quantify consequence of failure of sewer pipes. Additionally, an updated review of existing DSS for trenchless pipe rehabilitation is presented and analyzed. Finally, recommendations are made to improve existing methods to make the risk management process for trenchless rehabilitation decision making more efficient and practical.

AB  - Conservation biology faces critical challenges that require collaborative approaches, including novel strategies to support interactions among actors in biodiversity conflicts. The goals of this study were to investigate the concept of common ground across multiple issues and to explore its practical application for the support of environmental management. We conceptually defined common ground as the areas of relevance underlying the suite of issues expressed by people regarding environmental management in a particular context. We then empirically tested this in the Calakmul region of Mexico, where the complex socio-historical context and high biodiversity have created environmental management challenges that are now being addressed by a local, multi-stakeholder management board. We conducted 26 open interviews with members of the board and a further round of quantitative prioritisation of issues raised. Using a coding process designed to reveal common ground, we categorized the issues at four levels ranging from coarse to fine (themes, topics, sub-topics and perspectives). We then analysed two levels, topics (n = 14 issues) and sub-topics (n = 51 issues). To do so, we built common ground matrices to identify and analyze common ground among actors and across issues. First, cluster and non-metrical data analyses revealed the diversity of actor positions and the lack of consistent grouping among actors by occupational activity. This demonstrated that focusing on actors' differences might be misleading, and that actors' views were not closely aligned with their roles. Second, we located issues according to their levels of common ground and importance among actors. We showed that by not focusing on single issue conflicts, the identification of common ground across multiple issues can pinpoint synergies. We then proposed a framework for collaboration that prioritizes issues of high importance with greater common ground (e.g. sustainable resource use activities), to support the development of trust and norms of reciprocity among actors, strengthening the potential for future cooperation. By adopting this approach, environmental managers could support the initial stages of collaborative conservation strategies, engaging with other actors to seek common ground, avoid the creation of polarised groups and help effectively manage biodiversity conflicts.

AB  - The coal production industry is a major energy consuming and greenhouse gas emitting industry. Due to the accuracy of indicator design and the availability of data, assessing the efficiency and comparing the energy consumption of different companies has always been a problem. Thus, an accurate solution to these issues is needed. This study re-designs energy efficiency evaluation indicators for underground coal production. It uses eight indicators, divided into two categories (composite evaluation indicators and single process measurement indicators), summarizes the evaluation criteria for these indicators, and then develops a comprehensive Energy Efficiency Index (EEI). Based on the above, we compare the 13 mines belonging to Xinwen Mining Group with four other large-scale mining enterprises. The results show that the current composite indicator evaluation system does not accurately assess old coal mines, and can be replaced by the EEI due to its comprehensiveness, fairness, and it not being affected by any individual indicator. Lastly, this paper proposes management and technology measures to tap coal production energy efficiency potential, and finds the energy saving potential of Xinwen Mining Group is 16.8% per annum.

AB  - Resolving the potential groundwater yield zonation of sandstone aquifers occurring at depths of several hundred meters has been an important and challenging objective of the hydrogeological research focused on preventing flood hazards in coal mines. Using accessible geological exploration data we put forward a method of predicting the spatial distribution of groundwater storage potential in sandstone aquifers from Permian-age coal deposits in Juye Coalfield, Shangdong, China. A Geological, Tectonic and Lithological Composition Index (GTLCI) model was created using the following parameters: sandstone depth and thickness, faults length density (FaLD), faults density (FaD), fault frequency density (FaFD), fault scale density (FaSD), variation coefficient of the slope (VCS) of the coal seam, intensity index of folds in horizontal direction (IIFoH), and lithological composition index (LCI). Each of these factors was subsequently divided into 5 classes. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and trapezoidal fuzzy number (TFN) method was applied to calculate the weight of the conditioning factor and their respective sub-classes. Groundwater yield potential contour map, which was initially constructed using the GTLCI values revealed four groundwater abundance zones. The map was further refined by taking into account hydrogeologic data collected during mining activities. The GTLCI model predictive success rate of 80% was explained by the limited number of boreholes available for validation. It is considered that the GTLCI model is effective at predicting zonation of groundwater yield in the sandstone aquifers from Permian- age coal deposits in Juye Coalfield, China.

AB  - In this work we propose a novel approach for computing the variable pay/pay for performance component of employees in a technical institution based on Takagi Sugeno Kang (TSK)/Sugeno fuzzy inference system. Sugeno fuzzy inference system is an inference model based on fuzzy set theory and is known to handle MCDM (Multiple criteria decision making) problems quite efficiently. In the proposed model the Sugeno fuzzy inference system has been used to compute the variable pays of the faculties based on their individual API (Academic Performance Indicator) scores in a particular appraisal year. The model aims to overcome the pitfalls of the current forced distribution technique being used for appraisal and subsequent variable pay decisions. The performance of the proposed model has been tested with the API scores of all the faculties of the said institute. Along with that a function was used to generate random inputs in the range of API scores to extensively test the model. All the methods were implemented in MATLAB and the results were analyzed in EXCEL using the CORREL and PEARSON’s coefficient. Experimental results show that the proposed model is reliable and demonstrates significant improvement over the traditional forced distribution approach currently adopted.

AB  - This paper proposes a decision support (DS) framework that incorporates weather-related factors for the purpose of estimating the duration of projects. Inclement weather can have a serious effect on construction projects, particularly with regard to duration and costs. The weather has an impact on human resource productivity, supplier effectiveness and material damage which can, in turn, affect the duration of a construction project. The proposed five-module framework integrates weather variables, project performance variables and duration of project activities. This framework uses expert knowledge about the importance of weather variables, pairwise comparisons of weather variables with respect to different performance criteria, and similarly, pairwise comparisons of performance variables with respect to project activities. A model based on this framework, using multivariate statistical techniques and an analytical network process (ANP), is developed to estimate the duration of project activities, taking into account the impact of weather. The proposed model is illustrated with data from a construction project from Iran. Validation of the model is provided by comparing the actual duration of an activity with the estimated duration, using the proposed framework.
