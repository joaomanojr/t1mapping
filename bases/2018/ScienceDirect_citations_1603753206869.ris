AB  - We present a system-level synthesis approach for heterogeneous multi-processor on chip, based on Answer Set Programming(ASP). Starting with a high-level description of an application, its timing constraints and the physical constraints of the target device, our goal is to produce the optimal computing infrastructure made of heterogeneous processors, peripherals, memories and communication components. Optimization aims at maximizing speed, while minimizing chip area. Also, a scheduler must be produced that fulfills the real-time requirements of the application. Even though our approach will work for application specific integrated circuits, we have chosen FPGA as target device in this work because of their reconfiguration capabilities which makes it possible to explore several design alternatives. This paper addresses the bottleneck of problem representation size by providing a direct and compact ASP encoding for automatic synthesis that is semantically equivalent to previously established ILP and ASP models. We describe a use-case in which designers specify their applications in C/C++ from which optimum systems can be derived. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach toward existing heuristics and exact methods with synthesis results on a set of realistic case studies.

AB  - Extending of the T-operators on hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) is important in the theory and applications. In this paper, we used two comparative operators for expressing monotonicity of the T-operators on hesitant fuzzy elements (HFEs). Hence, properties of some T-operators for Xu-Xia partial order (≤ℍ(m)) and Xia-Xu order (⪯) are studied on typical hesitant fuzzy elements (THFEs). Finally, an application of T-operators on HFEs has been explained in fuzzy rule-based systems for a practical problem in economics. Also, for a conceptual comparison, a benchmark data under a hesitant fuzzy information environment has been used.

AB  - Following the gradual decline of Arctic sea ice, shipping using Arctic routes increased from 2010. This led to an upsurge in the number of studies investigating the potential of Arctic maritime routes. A systematic literature review was conducted to assess the extant literature from 1980 to 2017 on comparative studies between Arctic and traditional routes. This review also aimed to provide an initial understanding on route choice decision-making factors and to contribute to the literature by providing suggestions for future research and methodological considerations. The competitiveness of Arctic routes is evaluated from both economic and environmental perspectives. Research themes and methodological characteristics are analysed in order to establish an evidence base in Arctic shipping literature. It is identified that analytical research methods and transport cost models are mainly employed. The results indicate that although Arctic routes can be more cost-effective and energy efficient compared to traditional ones, especially in the long-term, they can mainly serve as seasonal alternatives for bulk and specialised shipping in the short-term.

AB  - In this study, a feasibility study was carried out in terms of quantification-characterization of waste, biomethane potential from organic biomass and bio-digester selection and designing. From waste quantification, 38% was found to be an organic fraction of the municipal solid waste (OFMSW) of the 1.4 million tonnes per year. The composition of the waste was investigated using a laboratory batch anaerobic digester for biochemical methane potential (BMP) and the waste to energy bio-digester selection and design for the anaerobic co-digestion of different OFMSW originating from the City of Johannesburg landfills. The carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of OFMSW was found to be below 13. Through co-digestion, the C/N ratio settled at 15. Laboratory experimental data from 500ml batch anaerobic digester operating at a mesophilic temperature of 37°C and pH of 6.9 had a good productivity of methane of average 59% recommended in the literature and was used to derive the volume of digester and surface area. The artificial intelligence (AI) technique was applied to select the most preferred digester model. Using the application of the simple multi-attribute rating (SMART) technique of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) as a decision support tool, the most preferred option of a bio-digester model was selected from a list of potential alternatives available in the market. The continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) scored highest with 79% and was selected as the most preferred digester for the OFMSW digestion. The geometry of the biodigester parameters was found to be comparable and economically feasible with the process parameters, energy generation from the BMP and scale up model for the independent power producer (IPP).

AB  - Basic research is the main powerhouse of a country’s potential for continuous economic growth, and national-level scientific research funding is an important source of capital that supports this basic research. Given these observations, this paper takes micro-level data from projects funded by the Department of Management Sciences in the National Natural Science Foundation of China between 2006 and 2010 to examine the relationship between the efficient use of research funding and the level of concentrated funding in certain research institutions. In contrast to the positive externalities produced by the concentration of R&D activities, our study finds that the accumulation of scientific research funding at the institution level is negative correlated with the knowledge output of the principal investigators of projects within the research institution. We explore the sources of the negative correlation and discuss some policy implications.

AB  - Recently, the calculus of fuzzy concept lattice is studied beyond the three-way fuzzy space ([0,1]3) for precise representation of uncertainty and vagueness in the attributes. However, to dovetail the uncertainty in case of voxel, multi-index or multi-polar information the properties of lattice theory need to be explored in component wise m-polar fuzzy space ([0,1]m). In this case, another problem arises while finding some of the hidden or interested pattern from the given m-polar fuzzy context for the knowledge processing tasks. To conquer this problem, current paper generalizes the mathematical background of concept lattice with m-polar fuzzy sets and its graphical properties. To elicit this objective, two methods are introduced for providing a unified framework based on discovered m-polar formal fuzzy concepts and their projection.

AB  - The waste-to-energy (WtE) project has attracted much attention from the society mainly because of the characteristic of environmental friendliness. And plant site selection occupies a prominent position during the whole life cycle of waste-to-energy project. In consideration of the ambiguity of subjective judgments of decision makers (DMs) and the compensation problem existing in decision process, we build a framework for WtE plant site selection decision utilizing a novel method with triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TIFNs). First of all, the criteria for optimal WtE plant siting are determined based on extended sustainability theory including four perspectives of economic, environment, society, and technology to meet the demand of current social development. Then, the TIFNs and the triangular intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric (TIFWG) operator are applied to describing the indefinite information and completing the conversion, so that the uncertainty and hesitation of decision information can be well expressed. Furthermore, the extended TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multiple attribute decision making) method in conjunction with PROMETHEE-II (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations) method is utilized to rank the alternatives, which makes this framework more practical and applicable. Finally, a case from China certifies the validity of the proposed framework.

AB  - The models that set the closest targets have made an important contribution to DEA as tool for the best-practice benchmarking of decision making units (DMUs). These models may help defining plans for improvement that require less effort from the DMUs. However, in practice we often find cases of poor performance, for which closest targets are still unattainable. For those DMUs, we propose a two-step benchmarking procedure within the spirit of context-dependent DEA and that of the models that minimize the distance to the DEA efficient frontier. This procedure allows to setting more realistically achievable targets in the short term. In addition, it may offer different alternatives for planning improvements directed towards DEA efficient targets, which can be seen as representing improvements in a long term perspective. Thus, the sequential approach provides managers with a decision-support tool for the design of continuous improvement strategies based on actionable targets, by learning from better practices of others as an expert system. To illustrate, we examine an example which is concerned with the research performance of public Spanish universities.

This method is an effective approach to multidisciplinary systems, which can be used to designer experiences during the design optimization process by fuzzy preference functions. In this study, two optimizations are done for Predator MQ-1 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV): (A) deterministic optimization and (B) robust optimization. In both problems, minimization of takeoff weight and drag is considered as objective functions, which have been optimized using Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA). In the robust design optimization, cruise altitude and velocity are considered as uncertainties that are modeled by the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method. Aerodynamics, stability and control, mass properties, performance, and center of gravity are used for multidisciplinary analysis. Robust design optimization results show 46% and 42% robustness improvement for takeoff weight and cruise drag relative to optimal design respectively.

AB  - The development and utilization of shallow geothermal energy have rapidly improved worldwide. The thermal physical parameters of rock and soil layers must be accurately measured to design a ground source heat pump system. The obtained thermal conductivity of rock and soil play a critical role in optimizing heat pump system and cost-saving design. In this study, detailed tests were performed on a borehole in Jixi City, Heilongjiang Province in northeast China. In situ geotechnical comprehensive thermal conductivity and layered rock thermal conductivities were obtained by traditional thermal response test (TRT) and distributed thermal response test (DTRT), respectively. A series of laboratory tests were also conducted on rock samples obtained from drilling and the thermal conductivities were compared with that obtained through DTRT. Changes in groundwater environment, moisture content contribute to the deviation of the laboratory experimental results from the value derived through in situ test. The influence of different factors and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was analyzed to determine the weight value for correcting the thermal conductivity tested in the laboratory. The accuracy of the layered conductivity obtained by DTRT, and laboratory test before and after modification was examined by the numerical model based on TOUGH2-MP code. The heat exchange power was predicted on the basis of thermal conductivity obtained by TRT (2.29 kW), DTRT (2.197 kW) and laboratory test before and after being corrected (1.917 kW and 2.180 kW, respectively). The proposed method was proven to be useful in determining layered rock thermal conductivity.

AB  - Rough set theory has shown success in being a filter-based feature selection approach for analyzing information systems. One of its main aims is to search for a feature subset called a reduct, which preserves the classification ability of the original system. In this paper, we consider ordered decision systems, where the preference order, a fundamental concept in dominance-based rough set approach, plays a critical role. In recent literature, based on the greedy hill climbing method, many heuristic attribute reduction algorithms are proposed by utilizing significance measures of attributes, and they are extended to deal with ordered decision systems. Unfortunately, they are often time-consuming, especially when applied to deal with large scale data sets with high dimensions. To reduce the complexity, a novel accelerator is introduced in heuristic algorithms from the perspectives of objects and criteria. Based on the new accelerator, the number of objects and the dimension of criteria are lessened thus making the accelerated algorithms faster than their original counterparts while maintaining the same reducts. Experimental analysis shows the validity and efficiency of the proposed methods.

AB  - The increasing development of civilization is one of the important issues exacerbating urban problems, such as pollution, poor sustainability, and weak security. The creation of ubiquitous cities (u-city), with intelligent convergence systems, is a solution to overcoming these problems. The u-city is at a more advanced level than a smart city, and building a smart city is a step toward the u-city. Thus, this study develops an effective framework to determine the required platform toward establishing a u-city by explores the main components of a smart city, such as citizens, environments, and key infrastructures, and the criteria to measure each component. The interaction between the components and their criteria, are specified using the Analytical Network Process (ANP) and the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods Finally, according to the weights obtained, a ubiquitous coefficient for a city is proposed. In this study, the u-coefficients for Tehran, Iran and Seoul, South Korea are obtained (45% and 92%, respectively), which verify the accuracy of the suggested framework for determining ubiquitous conditions of cities. Tehran has the highest weights in the basic components (citizens and governments) and it needs to invest in building a ubiquitous infrastructure in transportation, healthcare, and the economy.

AB  - This article presents a novel tuning design of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller in the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) system by using Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm with a new time domain performance criterion. This performance criterion was chosen to minimize the maximum overshoot, rise time, settling time and steady state error of the terminal voltage. In order to compare CS with other evolutionary algorithms, the proposed objective function was used in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithms for PID design of the AVR system. The performance of the proposed CS based PID controller was compared to the PID controllers tuned by the different evolutionary algorithms using various objective functions proposed in the literature. Dynamic response and a frequency response of the proposed CS based PID controller were examined in detail. Moreover, the disturbance rejection and robustness performance of the tuned controller against parametric uncertainties were obtained, separately. Energy consumptions of the proposed PID controller and the PID controllers tuned by the PSO and ABC algorithms were analyzed thoroughly. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the CS based PID controller has better control performance in comparison with other PID controllers tuned by the PSO and ABC algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed objective function remarkably improves the PID tuning optimization technique.

AB  - The application of the European directives related to the energy consumption of existing buildings leads to the integration of efficient techniques into the refurbishment actions. This procedure allows reaching high energy savings and reducing pollutant emissions. The identification of the energy consumption profile of the building stocks is a necessary step to evaluate the impact of retrofit measures. With this aim, the energy performance of representative dwellings has been analyzed to develop a citizen-oriented platform. This representativeness has been chosen through one parametric matrix that characterizes the residential building stock of Madrid. Different refurbishment strategies have been highlighted to assess the energy savings in comparison with the initial situation. Two building cases and three boundary conditions have been selected to develop six TRNSYS models. The energy impact produced by the implementation of selected refurbishment strategies has been evaluated through a sensitivity analysis. Batteries of simulations have been executed coupling the TRNSYS models with GenOpt. The most influential strategies are the typology of façades, insulation at the roof, variable set point temperatures, better glazing and exterior summer shading over the windows. Building performances to minimize the annual thermal needs and one economic study have been developed.

KW  - Utility function
AB  - In recent years, multiple objective decision making (MODM) has become more and more important, and multiple objective linear programming (MOLP) approaches have been widely used for solving MODM problems. Three popular fuzzy mathematical programming approaches, including maxmin, arithmetical average, and two-phase methods, are often employed to solve MOLP problems. However, maxmin and two-phase methods cannot obtain an efficient solution. Ideal and anti-ideal solutions are required in all traditional methods. Such solutions cannot easily be established as a model for a knowledge-based system or expert system. In order to enrich the body of knowledge related to the field of MOLP, a new multi-choice goal programming (MCGP) model is proposed to solve fuzzy MOLP (FMOLP) problems in which the ideal and anti-ideal solutions are no longer required. This reduces the complexity of the solution process for solving MODM. The original feasible region can be expended to a potential feasible region to determine the appropriate aspiration level for decision makers. The proposed methods can systematically solve MODM problem to obtain satisfactory solutions in one step. Thus, a model-based can easily be established for expert systems, knowledge-based system, and artificial intelligence systems. In addition, a revised utility function (UF) is derived to solve qualitative and quantitative MODM problems. Based on illustrative examples, the five methods (maxmin, arithmetical average, two-phase, goal programming (GP), and proposed models) are compared to reveal managerial implications. On the basis of these comparisons, DMs can easily determine the best suited solution for their specific MODM problems. Finally, a realistic example is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods.

AB  - In this paper, a resource constrained project scheduling problem with hierarchical alternatives and stochastic activity durations is studied. A stochastic chance constraint is introduced to formulate this problem. A metaheuristic framework called SAA/DAAA through integrating the sampling average approximation (SAA) with the population-based evolutionary artificial algae algorithm (AAA) is developed to solve the problem due to the NP-hardness nature of the problem. The priority-selection list (PSL) and schedule generation scheme (SGS) are introduced for local search. Experiments with different sizes (50-scale, 100-scale, 150-scale) as well as different uncertainty levels (moderate, medium, high) are used as examples to illustrate and validate the proposed method. The influences of sample size, sampling times and confidence level are also analyzed during experiments. In addition, the proposed discrete AAA (DAAA) is compared with classic GA and numerical experiments show that the SAA/DAAA outperforms the SAA/GA in terms of both objectives and solving time.

AB  - The paper examines Chinese bank efficiency with a unique sample of 127 banks during the peak period of the global financial crisis. We apply an innovative Data Envelopment Analysis method under a stochastic environment. In the first stage, within the ambit of the satisficing Data Envelopment Analysis model, the probabilities of achieving a minimal performance threshold are computed in a stochastic way. In the second subsequent stage, Support Vector Machine regression is applied to discriminate between high/low efficiency groups within each performance threshold. The results reveal that the overall efficiency level of the Chinese banks remains still low. This is considerably determined by the contextual variables of the ownership structure and cost structure of the Chinese banks. Policy implications are derived how to improve the corporate governance and credit allocation.

AB  - Common to multi-objective forest planning situations is that they all require comparisons, searches and evaluation among decision alternatives. Through these actions, the decision maker can learn from the information presented and thus make well-justified decisions. Interactive data visualization is an evolving approach that supports learning and decision making in multidimensional decision problems and planning processes. Data visualization contributes the formation of mental image data and this process is further boosted by allowing interaction with the data. In this study, we introduce a multi-objective forest planning decision problem framework and the corresponding characteristics of data. We utilize the framework with example planning data to illustrate and evaluate the potential of 14 interactive data visualization techniques to support multi-objective forest planning decisions. Furthermore, broader utilization possibilities of these techniques to incorporate the provisioning of ecosystem services into forest management and planning are discussed.

AB  - Technologies such as Internet of Things allow small devices to offer web-based services in an open and dynamic networking environments on a massive scale. End users or service consumers face a hard decision over which service to choose among the available ones, as security holds a key in the decision making process. In this paper a base linguistic evaluation set is designed, based on which all the other fuzzy term sets that used for describing security attributes are uniformed and integrated for calculating an overall security value of the services. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first practical solution to offer direct comparisons and rankings of network services based on multiple security attributes such as confidentiality, availability, privacy and accountability. We analysed four major cloud service platforms to illustrate the proposed approach.

A carbon footprint based incentive green supplier selection model, which can urge the participants in the green supply chain to initiatively make greener decisions, is proposed in this research. Both economic attributes (price, quantity, and lead time) and environmental attributes (green factors and carbon dioxide emissions (CO2)) are considered during the selection. The green factors of the selected suppliers and the environmental investment are taken into account during the determinations of the green factors. The CO2 emissions from the transportation and production processes are considered. Moreover, three models are put forward to maximize the total profits, maximize the green factors, and minimize the CO2 emissions. Numerical calculations and comparisons are provided to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed models.

AB  - Automatic creation of school timetables is a complex problem when it involves defining specific constraints and requirements. This paper presents a domain-specific language called REDOSPLAT which supports such definitions in a readable format. REDOSPLAT can be used when timetable programs with a graphical user interface are limited or too cluttered to express specific domain features. It uses customised, readable notation instead of technically oriented data formats which are usually used in timetable problems. The desired timetabling requirements are defined using sentences whose syntax is close to the syntax of spoken language. This paper encompasses the entire language syntax and semantics, the way a sentence is transformed into data structures which describe timetabling requirements, and the way the obtained data structures are transformed into models needed for different problem-solving algorithms. For the latter, REDOSPLAT is using integer linear programming to resolve the timetabling problem.

AB  - Urban air pollution with benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylenes (BTEX) is a common phenomenon in major cities where the pollution mainly originates from traffic as well as from residential heating. An attempt to rank cities according to their BTEX air pollution is not necessarily straight forward as we are faced with several individual pollutants simultaneously. A typical procedure is based on aggregation of data for the single compounds, a process that not only hides important information but is also subject to compensation effects. The present study applies a series of partial ordering tools to circumvent the aggregation. Based on partial ordering, most important indicators are disclosed, and an average ranking of the cities included in the study is derived. Since air pollution measurements are often subject to significant uncertainties, special attention has been given to the possible effect of uncertainty and/or data noise. Finally, the effect of introducing weight regimes is studied. In a concluding section the gross national income per person (GNI) is brought into play, demonstrating a positive correlation between BTEX air pollution and GNI. The results are discussed in terms of the ability/willingness to combat air pollution in the cities studied. The present study focuses on Almaty, the largest city in Kazakhstan and compares the data from Almaty to another 19 major cities around the world. It is found that the benzene for Almaty appears peculiar high. Overall Almaty appears ranked as the 8th most BTEX polluted city among the 20 cities included in the study.

AB  - Operational research models have been employed to understand development issues associated with environmental sustainability. This article describes a novel application of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to help extend a specific debate in the literature on Porter's hypothesis in environmental policy. The debate deals with the impact of flexibility of regulations on the relationship between innovation capabilities on financial performance in organisations. Using the resource based view of a firm, we hypothesise that relationship between innovation capabilities and financial performance in firms depends on how flexible or inflexible environmental regulations are. We apply DEA to capture the flexibility of environmental regulations. Our results indicate that innovation capabilities significantly influence financial performance of firms if firms feel that the environmental regulations they face are flexible and offer more freedom in meeting the requirements of regulations. On the other hand, corporations that feel that they face more inflexible regulations are not so effective in improving their financial performance with their innovation capabilities.

AB  - Background
Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy has dramatically shifted therapeutic perspectives for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We assessed cost-effectiveness of anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy as first-line therapy for advanced NSCLC.
Methods
We retrieved survival, progression, and safety data comparing first-line pembrolizumab to platinum-doublets for advanced NSCLC patients with PD-L1 expression ≥50%, non-mutated EGFR, and non-translocated ALK, from KEYNOTE-024. Published United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US) costs informed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Our analysis was based on a Bayesian Markov model of disease with full lifetime horizon. We estimated costs in USD and summarized effectiveness as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
Results
Patients treated with pembrolizumab accumulated 1.80 QALYs (95% CrI 1.56–1.89), for moderate dependency between outcomes, compared to 1.06 QALYs (0.94–1.13) with chemotherapy. From a British National Health System (NHS) perspective, the ICER was $52k ($43k–$69k) per end-of-life (EoL) adjusted QALY gained, above the 42k USD threshold, while from a US cost perspective, the ICER was $49k ($40k-67k) per EoL adjusted QALY, below the hypothetical 100k USD threshold.
Conclusions
Evidence suggests first-line pembrolizumab for NSCLC may be cost-effective in the US but not the UK, in spite of very similar ICER values in both countries.

AB  - Reverse logistics (RL) and the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) are integral parts of the holistic waste management process. One of the important end-of-life (EOL) products considered in the RL/CLSC is Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)/E-waste. Numerous research papers were published in the RL and CLSC disciplines focusing WEEE separately. However, there is no single review article found on the product-specific issues. To bridge this gap, a total of 157 papers published between 1999 and May 2017 were selected, categorized, analyzed using content analysis method. The method involves four steps: material collection, descriptive analysis, category selection and material evaluation. For the systematic literature review, the steps were followed and four main types of research in the field of RL and CLSC of E-waste, namely designing and planning of reverse distribution, decision making and performance evaluation, conceptual framework, and qualitative studies were identified and reviewed. Research gaps in literature were diagnosed to suggest future research opportunities. The review first of its kind that may provide a useful reference for academicians, researchers and industry practitioners for a better understanding of WEEE focused RL/CLSC activities and research.

AB  - Monitoring is a key component of risk management at geologic carbon storage (GCS) sites, serving both to help operators understand and manage site performance, and to assure the public and other stakeholders that effective containment is maintained and impacts avoided. Potential leakage of CO2 and/or brine through wellbores, faults, and fractures to potable groundwater resources is a primary risk concern at onshore GCS sites. In this paper, we present an adaptive methodology for leakage risk-based monitoring design. The methodology uses a risk event tree to predict the likelihood of leakage occurrence, with detection probabilities of risk events estimated for multiple monitoring plans. The overall detection probability of a proposed monitoring plan incorporates baseline data, stochastically simulated leakage events, and the likelihood that a set of technologies will detect the changes in baseline conditions induced by the simulated leakage events. The adaptive monitoring design methodology is demonstrated with a representative case study of CO2 and brine leaking from a well to a potable groundwater aquifer using simulated data at the High Plains aquifer in the United States. Groundwater quality parameters, pH, total dissolved solids and benzene concentrations, were used to calculate the corresponding detection probabilities of conventional groundwater sampling and fixed sensor monitoring for selected leakage scenarios. The overall detection probability considering all monitoring information was then calculated to evaluate proposed monitoring plan designs. Finally, a simple optimization problem to maximize detection probability with constrained monitoring resources was presented as an application example to close the loop of monitoring and modeling.

KW  - Decision-making
AB  - Venture capitalists are confronted with decision-making problems under an uncertain investment circumstance, which lead them to rely heavily on intuition and psychological state to make their decisions in most cases. It has attracted more and more researches to focus on such behaviors of venture capitalists in recent years and along with the development of behavioral finance in venture capital field. Through the review of framework of venture capitalists’ decision-making and the investigation of background of venture capital market in China, we find that the decision-making framework, which is based on the traditional expected utility theory with hypothesis that the investor is completely rational, is inconsistent with reality. Moreover, the decision-making information is often depicted as crisp number with probability that couldn’t express the uncertainty which is the fundamental nature of venture capital circumstance. Therefore, a novel approach that considers both the bounded rationality of venture capitalists and the uncertain circumstance of venture capital in decision-making is urgent to select the promising enterprise in China. Fortunately, prospect theory, as one of the greatest achievement in behavioral finance, thinks that venture capitalists focus on subjective probabilities instead of objective probabilities and show the behavior characterized by risk aversion over gains and risk seeking over losses, which can depict the psychological state of venture capitalists properly. Furthermore, the intuitionistic fuzzy information can express essential uncertainty in venture capital circumstance accurately. Therefore, we adopt Intuitionistic Fuzzy Prospect Theory that integrates both the merits of prospect theory and intuitionistic fuzzy information to aid venture capitalists to make a better decision in the real world. In this paper, the detailed steps of how to select a promising enterprise has been illustrated. Then, a practical example of selecting the promising enterprise for venture capitalists in Ali Capital is provided to exhibit the process of application and exemplify the feasibility of this selecting approach. Meanwhile, from the comparison of ranking results derived by TOPSIS and this approach, we find that the approach proposed in this paper is superior to the TOPSIS in selecting the promising enterprise according to the subsequent funded results of enterprises.

AB  - The rapid economic and population growth in developing countries, effective and efficient energy usage has turned out to be crucial due to the rising concern of depleting fossil fuels, of which, one-third of primary energy is consumed in buildings and expected to rise by 53% up to 2030. This roaring sector posing a challenge, due to 90% of people spend most of their time in buildings, requires enhanced well-being of indoor environment and living standards. Therefore, building operations require more energy because most of the energy is consumed to make the indoor environment comfortable. Consequently, there is the need of improved energy efficiency to decrease energy consumption in buildings. In relation to this, the primary challenge of building control systems is the energy consumption and comfort level are generally conflicting to each other. Therefore, an important problem of sustainable smart buildings is to effectively manage the energy consumption and comfort and attain the trade-off between the two. Thus, smart buildings are becoming a trend of future construction that facilitates intelligent control in buildings for the fulfillment of occupant’s comfort level. In this study, an intelligent multi-objective system has been developed with evolutionary multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) optimization method. The corresponding case study simulation results for the effective management of users’ comfort and energy efficiency have been carried out. The case study results show the management of energy supply for each comfort parameter and maintain high comfort index achieving balance between the energy consumption and comfort level.

AB  - The poor technical conditions of the water supply systems complicate the quality of urban population life and create a burden on public budgets. We examine the water supply system factors in Ukraine and identify the main parameters that restrain their development. This study examines the development of overhaul planning in water supply systems in Ukraine, taking into account the network equipment-aging factor. We employ a mathematical technique for optimizing the planned costs for overhauls in water supply networks by engaging latent-semantic analysis (LSA). The LSA provides a novel approach to sustainable planning of several economic factors in water supply. The exhibited results underline prominent technical and economic similarities in Ukrainian water supply systems. These results allow us to reveal an unsustainable usage of public funding for overhauls. In addition, the overhaul planning model engaged, improves the Ukrainian water supply sector. It helps the country to abandon the current reactive water management approach and aims towards proactive and sustainable water management. This innovative approach could redefine the public managerial profile, calibrating it towards a socially responsible one, significantly raising the quality of the urban population's living standards.

AB  - Today, e-waste management practices are gaining momentum because of the global environmental regulations, but the presence of barriers makes the implementation of e-waste management difficult. Moreover, e-waste contains valuable metals as a well as hazardous substance that has more deceptive impacts on the ecosystem. This study aims to identify ten barriers based on the literature and the perceptions of experts involved in e-waste management issues. In this paper, we employed an interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and Decision Making Trail and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) for understanding the hierarchal and contextual relationship structure among the barriers of e-waste management. The study shows that no autonomous barriers are present in the course of study. The result suggests that the lack of public awareness about e-waste recycling and the lack of policies addressing e-waste issues are the root cause barriers as depicted by the novel ISM-DEMATEL based methodology. This present novel model helps the policy and decision maker’s to find out the mutual relationship and interlinking among the barriers.

AB  - An ongoing two-year research is performing with the general objective to assess the feasibility of a system integrating the production of green-energy and its consumption inside and close to port areas for mobility services. The system is composed by two elements: (a) a “sea-to-grid” technological component harvesting and producing electrical energy from sea waves; and (b) a “green” logistic service based on the use of Fully Electric Vehicles (FEVs). A pilot study will be conducted near an Italian port area supporting passengers and freight mobility between a port and a backward (sub)-urban area. The proposed system is within the environmental goals set by the EU (Europe 2020 Strategy) and the Italian Government (National Energy Masterplan). Indeed, the energy-producing technology reduces dependence from traditional energy sources (coal, gas, oil) and consequently reduces their negative effects (greenhouse gases, air pollution, etc.). Considering that the energy is produced by sea waves, the system transfers the entire amount of produced (green) energy to the electric vehicles. The system will be experimented in a medium size urbanized area and the energy will be produced in a small size port.

AB  - Many Game Changing Innovations (GCIs) from the academic institutions struggle in the Technology Valley of Death (TVD) and they fail to reach commercialization. The academic researchers often lack motivation to seek entrepreneurial opportunities for their GCIs. They are often discouraged after considering the burden required to convince private investors to finance their GCIs beyond technology readiness level 4. Further, many academic institutions lack a structured framework to bridge the divide between a basic research and viable product. Here we propose a four-pronged approach for developing sustainability performance metrics that can be used by early investors to understand the commercialization prospects of the GCIs: (1) conduct a screening-level LCA of the GCI and simultaneously reduce uncertainties of underlying data and technological readiness; (2) compare the LCA performance of the GCI with similar commercial products in the target market; (3) factor the LCA results into investment evaluation methods; and (4) transform LCA results into indicators that reflect sustainability performance of the innovation. Finally, we present a case study that highlights the use of this approach for developing commercial opportunities for the emerging graphene-composites as corrosion resistant coatings for civil infrastructure applications. The paper also suggests an approach for promoting a sustainability driven innovation culture in academia.

AB  - In this work, a satellite heat pipe operated with the ammonia and methanol are investigated for the multi-objective optimization. Optimization results are used for the comparative analysis of both the heat pipe. Optimization problem of the heat pipe is formed considering minimization of the thermal resistance and total mass of heat pipe and solved using the heat transfer search algorithm. An application example of satellite heat pipe is presented, and results are obtained in the form of Pareto-optimal points. Seven geometric parameters which include the length of evaporator and condenser section, tube wall thickness, vapor core diameter, mesh number of wick, thickness of wick, and diameter of wick wire are investigated in the optimization study. Further, the effect of condenser temperature, heat load, and length of the adiabatic section on ammonia and methanol heat pipe is explored and discussed. Furthermore, the effect of the design variables and its sensitivity to performance parameters of the heat pipe are also presented. Comparative results revel that, for any given value of the total mass of heat pipe, 82.17–57.16% lower thermal resistance is observed with the ammonia heat pipe as compared to methanol heat pipe. Finally, uncertainty propagation analysis of the obtained Pareto solutions are carried out with the different uncertainty levels and observed that the results have relatively good robustness performance for uncertainty less than 5%.

AB  - The stone processing sector has begun to implement the Cleaner Production (CP) strategy to tackle with these burdens caused by the production process. Decision-makers need to select the most suitable cutting fluid for achieving the CP mode in their firm. However, the assessment methods of characteristics and performances of cutting fluid in granite processing field have rarely been examined in the literature. This paper proposed a multi-criteria evaluation system that enables decision-makers to quantitatively analyze the comprehensive effectiveness of application of cutting fluid in their granite production lines. A four-hierarchy indicator system was initially structured with three attributes, 13 characteristics and 30 indicators according to the context and literature of the stone processing field. The definitions of measurement method for all the indicators were closely related to the laws, rules, regulations and discharge standards. The decision algorithm was designed based on the integration of two distinctive Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) techniques: Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach was used to determine the weights of each indicator, and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) technique was applied to obtain the prioritization of alternative cutting fluids. This research introduced the statistical analysis principle to help the decision makers to further understand the nature of the final ranking: confidence interval (CI) provided the decision-makers an interval where the ranking may be valid instead of a single absolute rank; and Tukey's HSD tests were done to show if the final score of alternatives were statistically different from each other. A case of application demonstrated that the proposed decision method and procedures can become a scientific foundation for formulating guidelines to select the most suitable cutting fluid for implementing CP strategy in the granite processing organizations.

AB  - The presence of solar energy systems has increased significantly in recent years both in rural areas –in the form of solar farms–, and in urban areas as part of building installations. This transformation of the landscape, in spite of the good social acceptance of solar energy, causes an aesthetic impact whose interest has been growing in literature in recent years. This study aimed to review prior literature in order to establish the objective factors, aesthetic perception and methods that are most relevant when assessing the aesthetic impact. As a result of the lack of consensus, a new qualitative methodological framework is proposed that can serve as a basis for future research in the field of the integration of solar energy and its aesthetic impact. The framework comprises three sub-impacts: land use, solar system energy and glare. The results are discussed for future research and innovation in building photovoltaic integration and for SES site location and its environmental impact assessments.

AB  - Olive is considered as one of the most important and useful products, but the traditional harvesting methods are failing to fulfill the current need; therefore, it is crucial to make the olive harvesting mechanized. In order to expedite the olive harvesting mechanization process, the engineers have designed various machines and equipment, which have their own special advantages. Now, the main challenge is to select the best olive harvesting machine to develop and improve the economic conditions in agricultural field to maintain the food demand. In the present study, we intend to present a decision support system to aid decision-making about olive harvesting machines. To achieve this target, we evaluate six candidate machines with nine important criteria and classify them into three groups: beneficial, non-beneficial, and target-based criteria. For weighting the criteria, the best-worst method is applied, and because of having target criterion in the selection problem, the decision matrix is normalized by the target-based technique. Finally, using two proposed methods, target-based MULTIMOORA and WASPAS, we select the best harvesting machine. In addition, we employ dominance method to integrate the resultant rankings of harvesting machines.

AB  - In nowadays, increased energy efficiency in buildings and reduced thermal energy consumption requires innovative solutions and appropriate district heating system development planning process. 4th generation district heating system is one of the key solutions for improved overall system efficiency by decreased heat losses, improved heat generation efficiency, more efficient use of renewable energy sources and other advantages. The article describes the approach and the methodology for development of strategy to transform the existing DH system to 4GDH system particularly in cases with low DH systems loads. Two factors (low heat load and low temperatures) are becoming more and more actual. The article analyses the transformation process of the particular small-scale DH system in a parish located in the East part of Latvia. As a result, several transformation scenarios are identified. The technical solutions include replacement of a boiler, heating network reconstruction, heat supply temperature lowering and solar panel installation. Further technical analyses is carried out for system development evaluation and strategy implementation. Results shows that it is essential to evaluate the future energy efficiency measures in buildings when such small scale system is evaluated as it results in lower heat density and higher specific heat losses.

AB  - Coalbed methane (CBM) resources are abundant in Gujiao blocks, Xishan coalfield, China. However, there is little previous geological research regarding coalbed methane. Using a quantitative and qualitative index, the hydrocarbon source rocks and preservation conditions of No. 2, 8 and 9 coalbed methane systems in Gujiao blocks were evaluated through a multi-level fuzzy method. On this basis, the comprehensive favourable area of three CBM systems and multi-layer commingled production were predicted. The results showed that the comprehensive score trend of hydrocarbon source rocks in Gujiao blocks gradually increases from southeast to northwest. The comprehensive score trend of preservation conditions increases gradually from north to south. The No. 2 coalbed methane system of the Shanxi formation is given priority over level II, which is distributed in the central and southern study area. The No. 8 coalbed methane system of the Taiyuan formation is given priority over level III, followed by level IV. The No. 9 coalbed methane system of the Taiyuan formation is given priority over level II and level III, which is distributed in the central and southern study area. Most of the area is suitable for individual CBM exploitation of No. 8 coal. The favourable area for the No. 2+8 coal layer is located in parts of the central, south-western and south-eastern study area. The favourable area for No. 8+9 coal layer is located in the Dongqu well field and the southern Tunlan well field. The favourable area for No. 2+8+9 coal layer is located in the eastern Yang Zhuang well field.

AB  - Performance-based design (PBD) of buildings can be properly addressed in a multi-objective optimization framework. However, computational costs of such an approach will be very expensive especially if nonlinear time-history analysis (NTHA) is used as the evaluation tool. In this paper, significant reductions in computational costs of solving structural multi-objective optimization problems is achieved by proposing a new metaheuristic surrogate model called Surrogate FC-MOPSO. In this method, which is an extension of FC-MOPSO algorithm, NTHA and pushover analysis (PA) are simultaneously employed for evaluating system responses. PAs are adopted as an approximation tool in the surrogate model while the responses corresponding to feasible solutions are always evaluated from NTHAs. The final Pareto optimal solutions, which yield tradeoffs between initial and life-cycle costs (LCCs), are already evaluated based on NTHAs. It is shown that application of the proposed method results in substantial reductions of runtime of the considered problems. It is also demonstrated that adopting PAs as the only evaluation tool in optimal performance-based design of structures can result in unreliable solutions.

AB  - Optimization of complex real-world problems often involves multiple objectives to be considered simultaneously. These objectives are often non-commensurable and competing. For example, material handling is a vital element of industrial processes, which involves a variety of operations including the movement, storage and control of materials throughout the processes of manufacturing, distribution, and disposal while having to satisfy multiple objectives. Having an efficient and effective material handling system (MHS) is of great importance to various industries, such as manufacturing and logistics industries, for maintaining and facilitating a continuous flow of materials through the workplace and guaranteeing that required materials are available when needed. In this paper, a hybrid multi-objective optimization algorithm largely based on Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) is applied to simulation-based optimization of material handling system. This proposed algorithm hybridizes the AIS with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) by incorporating the crossover operator derived from the biological evolution. The reason behind such hybridization is to further enhance the diversity of the clone population and the convergence of the algorithm. In this paper, other than conducting numerical experiments to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm by using several benchmark problems, the proposed algorithm is also applied to optimize a multi-objective simulation-based problem on a material handling system in order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm in real-life cases. The results show that for most cases the proposed algorithm outperforms the other benchmark algorithms especially in terms of solution diversity.

AB  - In this research, cropping pattern optimization models have been developed to maximize the benefits and minimize the potential negative effects of quantitative-qualitative conjunctive use of unconventional surface water (treated wastewater) and groundwater in agricultural irrigation. Three objective functions were considered: maximizing the benefits from crop patterns, reducing nitrogen leaching, and improving the rate of aquifer recharge. The developed models use particle swarm optimization (PSO) integrated with an additive weighting method and a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm for different single- and three-objective optimization scenarios in the Varamin irrigation network in Iran, and then the results of the models were compared. The solutions resulting from the three-objective model using the PSO algorithm with the additive weighting method indicated that the benefits obtained from optimizing cropping patterns, water consumption productivity, and aquifer recharge were increased by 7%, 49%, and 20%, respectively. Meanwhile, the conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater and the consumption of nitrogen fertilizer were decreased by 35% and 88%, respectively. The solutions resulting from the three-objective model using the MOPSO algorithm, forming Pareto front, and then using TOPSIS to select the optimal solution from among the non-dominated solutions showed that the benefits obtained from optimizing cropping patterns, water consumption productivity, and aquifer recharge were increased by 7%, 47% and 15%, respectively. The objectives of conjunctive use of treated wastewater and groundwater and the consumption of nitrogen fertilizer were decreased by 36% and 89%, respectively. The difference between the objective function values of the two algorithms is about 0.4% to 4%, which shows the proximity of the models in finding the optimal solution. The results of this research can be used to optimize the use of water resources, increase farmers’ benefits, and decrease nitrogen leaching from irrigation and drainage networks.

AB  - Technology, such as personal computers and mobile devices, alters the foundation of how people communicate and interact with their surrounding environment. Emerging technologies affect every industry and management of supply chain and logistics are no exception. Given that Digital Supply Chain (DSC) provides several opportunities to companies the topic has received increasing attention from both academia and industry in the recent years. Today, an emerging worldwide trend in supply chain management is a shift of the focus from classical supply chains towards DSC, which leverages new solutions to generate new sources of revenue and additional business value for organizations. Recognizing these potential benefits, today’s modern organizations now interact with their dealers through DSC processes for improved efficiency and effectiveness in their production and delivery operations. Supplier selection is one of the crucial processes that has been affected by the digitalization of supply chain management. Addressing multi-criteria nature of the supplier selection process, this article introduces a new DSC approach for the first time to support the supplier selection process. This approach develops a group decision making (GDM) method in an uncertain environment. This methodology also considers decision makers when they are under pressure and/or lack expertise during the evaluation process. The proposed framework integrates for the first time the Interval Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy (IVIF) Sets, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) under a GDM environment. IVIF AHP is used to evaluate criteria weights and IVIF ARAS methodology is used for the alternative assessment procedure. The paper also included the analyses for the selection of a suitable supplier in a real case study from Turkey to illustrate the validity of the proposed novel approach.

AB  - Nineteen evolutionary algorithms, including single and hybrid optimization algorithms, are used for determining the optimum size of a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) that is comprised of a wind turbine, a photovoltaic panel, a battery bank, and a reverse osmosis desalination unit. The main source electrical power for the reverse-osmosis desalination unit for producing fresh water is solar and wind energy, and batteries are used as back up units. Integer and continuous variables in the HRES optimization model for a remote area of Iran are considered. The optimization aims to meet the load continuously while minimizing the HRES life cycle cost subject to relevant constraints. Also, to ensure reliability, the reliability index is assessed for the loss of power supply probability. In order to achieve optimal performance, various versions well-known optimization approaches are used: particle swarm optimization, bee swarm optimization, harmony search, simulated annealing, chaotic search, and tabu search algorithm. The results show that hybrid optimization techniques provide the best performance among the considered evolutionary algorithms and that using the HRES reduces system costs and increases system reliability in general and for increasing fresh water availability.

AB  - Employing cloud computing to acquire the benefit of cloud by optimizing various parameters that meet changing demands is a challenging task. The optimal mapping of tasks to virtual machines (VMs) and VMs to physical machines (PMs) (known as VM placement) problem are necessary for advancing energy consumption and resource utilization. High heterogeneity of tasks as well as resources, great dynamism and virtualization make the consolidation issue more complicated in the cloud computing system. In this paper, a complete mapping (i.e., task VM and VM to PM) algorithm is proposed. The tasks are classified according to their resource requirement and then searching for the appropriate VM and again searching for the appropriate PM where the selected VM can be deployed. The proposed algorithm reduces the energy consumption by depreciating the number of active PMs, while also minimizes the makespan and task rejection rate. We have evaluated our proposed approach in CloudSim simulator, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over some existing standard algorithms.

The new eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) standard seems to have replaced EDI types of solutions. This paper applies the Best Worst Method to identify the key factors that lead to the dominance of these business reporting standards. The results show that the key factors for standard dominance are the overall commitment of key stakeholders, timing of entry, and installed base, and suggest that XBRL has the best chance of becoming the dominant standard, replacing EDI as the standard for business reporting. However, this will take time due to the installed base of systems.

AB  - Large scale group decision making (LGDM) problems and social network analysis (SNA) methods are both attracting increasing attention, and SNA methods are useful for addressing LGDM problems. By considering social network information, a new interval type-2 fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) model is proposed to solve LGDM problems in complex and uncertain environments. First, a SNA community detection method is applied to reduce the complexity of large scale decision makers (DMs) according to the social connections among them. Then, interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FSs) and linguistic variables are employed to handle the uncertainties, and the TOPSIS method is improved using IT2 FSs to obtain an optimal alternative for a LGDM problem. Next, decision weights are computed based on the centrality of the SNA, and the decision information is aggregated by the interval type-2 fuzzy weighted average method. The procedure for solving LGDM problems is presented. Finally, an illustrative example is investigated to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution for LGDM problems, and the results are compared with those of an existing method to verify the validity of the new proposed method.

AB  - Due to increasing pressure for achieving sustainability objectives, the concept of sustainable product design and development is gaining more attention in recent research. In the past, a plethora of eco-design tools that address only the environmental aspect have been developed. Hence, previous review articles focused mainly on eco-design tools, such as life cycle assessment (LCA) and others. Unlike previous studies, the main contribution of this article was to review and analyze the recent and emerging product design tools (published from 2007 to 2017) which considered other dimensions of sustainability along with the environment. Based on the criteria of sustainability dimensions, this paper proposed a generic and broader classification scheme to enhance the understanding of these recent tools. Those which included two aspects of sustainability were categorized as partial sustainable product design (P-SPD) tools, and those which covered three aspects of sustainability were classified as sustainable product design (SPD) tools. The analysis revealed that SPD tools were less mature and standard as compared to P-SPD tools. The majority of both P-SPD and SPD tools were based on a life cycle perspective. However, P-SPD tools were found to be more useful at early design stages. In addition, this paper presented the case studies of the tools to decipher their practical utility. It also discussed the hurdles and problems associated with the methodological development and practical utility of the tools. Founded on these difficulties, future research directions were presented. In essence, a coordinated and responsible effort among practitioners, governments, societies and researchers is needed to ensure the successful implementation of the tools.

AB  - The potential of smart cities in remediating environmental problems in general and waste management, in particular, is an important question that needs to be investigated in academic research. Built on an integrative review of the literature, this study offers insights into the potential of smart cities and connected communities in facilitating waste management efforts. Shortcomings of existing waste management practices are highlighted and a conceptual framework for a centralized waste management system is proposed, where three interconnected elements are discussed: (1) an infrastructure for proper collection of product lifecycle data to facilitate full visibility throughout the entire lifespan of a product, (2) a set of new business models relied on product lifecycle data to prevent waste generation, and (3) an intelligent sensor-based infrastructure for proper upstream waste separation and on-time collection. The proposed framework highlights the value of product lifecycle data in reducing waste and enhancing waste recovery and the need for connecting waste management practices to the whole product life-cycle. An example of the use of tracking and data sharing technologies for investigating the waste management issues has been discussed. Finally, the success factors for implementing the proposed framework and some thoughts on future research directions have been discussed.

KW  - Centralized DEA approach
AB  - Carbon tax policy is widely used to control greenhouse gases and how to determine a suitable carbon tax rate is very important for policy makers considering the trade-off between environmental protection and economic development. In an industry regulated by carbon tax policy, we consider two competing firms who sell ordinary products and green products respectively. In order to promote the firm who sells ordinary product to reduce carbon emissions, the government of China imposes carbon tax on the ordinary products. For the government, three objectives are considered when it makes carbon tax policy. They are increasing the government revenue, reducing the government expenditure and decreasing the carbon emissions. For the firms, it is important to explore their pricing strategies taken into account of the government tax policy. To find an optimal carbon tax rate and to achieve the three objectives simultaneously, we consider this as a multiple criteria decision-making problem. Hence, we propose to use a centralized data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to solve it. We find that when one firm produces ordinary products and the other produces green products, the government may set a high tax rate. While when both firms sell ordinary products, the optimal tax policy for each firm is different and the government may impose a higher tax rate for one firm and a lower tax rate for the other firm.

AB  - Green purchasing is a critical factor in sustainable enterprise development, and it often affects a company's business performance and environmental protection practices. An enterprise must have an appropriate assessment model to address the complexities of green purchasing. Most green purchasing studies have focused on the use of green criteria in the selection of suppliers to develop sustainable operations. By contrast, there have been few articles on green supply chain management discussing both green supplier evaluation and order allocation. This study proposes a novel model that integrates the best–worst method (BWM), modified fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), and fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (FMOLP) to solve problems in green supplier selection and order allocation. We demonstrated the proposed method using actual data provided by an electronics company. The results indicate that this model can effectively evaluate the performance of green suppliers and can also optimize order allocation for qualified suppliers.

AB  - A rockburst is a sudden dynamic process under high geostress conditions where rocks spontaneously explode. This is an important geological problem for underground construction processes. A rockburst could lead to equipment damage, casualties, and construction delays. Therefore, rockburst prediction and classification are extremely significant. A prediction and classification model is established by introducing the basic theory of the ideal-point method, considering the rockburst mechanism. Three parameters are selected as evaluation indexes, including the rock stress coefficient (σθ/σc), rock brittleness coefficient (σc/σt), and elastic energy index (Wet). To eliminate any correlation between the parameters, a principal component analysis based on mutual information (MIPCA) for the rockburst feature selection is used to calculate a new group of parameters. Then, using the information-entropy theory, the weight coefficients of these new evaluation indexes are confirmed. Finally, using statistics-related projects, engineering-case analyses show the feasibility and applicability of the proposed model. A computer evaluation program with a rockburst-classification interface was developed, based on the proposed model. This model and computer software can be used for other similar engineering practices in the future.

This paper presents a review on the optimization approaches for hybrid DEG systems, considering both stand-alone and grid-connected systems. There are several optimization techniques used on DEG systems, comprising of analytical and artificial intelligent (AI) and hybrid techniques. This work encompasses the selected journal papers published especially in the last five years. A brief background of the optimization approaches been highlighted, particularly identifying the most common techniques to give the basis for analysis of the approaches currently applied on hybrid DEG systems. The analysis shows that AI techniques are still dominating the techniques used for optimization of DEG systems, with particle swarm optimization (PSO) recognized as the most used AI method. The objective functions in the optimization of hybrid DEG systems are currently defined to maximize the reliability, to minimize the expected interruption cost, and to optimize operation schedule of DEG resources.

AB  - Because of the profound adjustment of the global economy and significant fluctuations in energy prices, many coal workers in coal-mining cities are experiencing great risks to their livelihood. Thus, coal workers’ livelihood have become an important social issue worthy of investigation. This study use the rough set-technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution-rank-sum ratio (RS-TOPSIS-RSR) methodology and construct a composite coal miners’ livelihood vulnerability index (CMLVI) to assess coal workers’ livelihood vulnerability in 33 coal-mining cities. The results show that, from the time dimension perspective, the livelihood vulnerability of cities varies with time and even the same cities have different degrees in each of the three years. From the horizontal perspective, the coal miners' livelihood vulnerability level in comparatively developed mid-eastern region is significantly lower than that in the underdeveloped western and northeast regions of China. In addition, cities with the same level of livelihood vulnerability may have different vulnerability patterns and even low vulnerability cities may have high vulnerability in some dimensions. Based on the findings, we propose policy measures that aim to reduce the sensitivity of habitat conditions, improve the resilience of society, and enhance the stability of individuals in order to address livelihood problems.

AB  - Many developed high density cities around the world are facing unprecedented challenges as their infrastructure facilities are aging while citizen demands are ever surging. The concerted efforts of different infrastructure stakeholders are indispensable to elevate the quality, reliability, and capacity of infrastructure systems to make high-density cities more sustainable and resilient against increasing climate change and manmade threats. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated framework for multisector infrastructure asset management. For deriving the framework, case studies are conducted first on the best infrastructure asset management (IAM) practices of different countries in such diverse aspects as core process integration, contingency management, climate change response and adaptation, program coordination and orchestration, social value creation and sharing, risk management, resilience and sustainability. By using the criteria and a list of questions obtained from the case studies, interviews with different stakeholders in selected infrastructure sectors in Hong Kong are subsequently carried out to identify the barriers and possible solutions to enhancing the integrated management of multisector infrastructure assets in high-density cities. To facilitate such municipalities in managing their infrastructure assets effectively and efficiently, the proposed multisector integrated IAM framework is established from the holistic perspectives of information integration, process integration, collective decision, and harmonization between interdependent infrastructure systems.

AB  - Energy providers still struggle to decide on which digital energy services can help them stay competitive and aligned with energy efficiency policy targets. This research aims to assist organisations in choosing a service by modelling the selection process along decision criteria via the Analytic Hierarchy Process. This analysis includes evaluations by surveying experts for their opinions and an assessment of objective decision factors such as technical feasibility, business potential, behavioural change and innovativeness. It was found that behavioural and business factors are most important for organisations choosing new services, indicating that there should be a stronger focus on highlighting and assessing these aspects in future research. Additionally, all ICT-based services still ranked closely to each other, demonstrating that it is neither imperative nor easy to identify a single service. It can be concluded that energy providers should adopt a wider approach by offering a digital platform of energy services. Likewise, political adjustments should be enacted in parallel which enable approaches more conducive to organisations for gaining relevant experience. Examples are establishing innovation zones and altering restrictive regulations to facilitate markets to transfer monetary incentives to customers as means to enable new ways how such services can be offered.

To explore these factors we defined an information gap hypothesis, based on a theory of cumulative uncertainty in ES appraisals. When decision context requirements for accuracy and reliability increase, and the expected uncertainty of the ES appraisal methods also increases, the likelihood of methods being used is expected to drop, creating a potential information gap in governance. In order to test this information gap hypothesis, we evaluate 26 case studies and 80 ecosystem services appraisals in a large integrated EU research project. We find some support for a decreasing likelihood of ES appraisal methods coinciding with increasing accuracy and reliability requirements of the decision-support context, and with increasing uncertainty. We do not find that information costs are the explanation for this information gap, but rather that the research project interacted mostly with stakeholders outside the most decision-relevant contexts. The paper discusses how alternative definitions of integrated valuation can lead to different interpretations of decision-support information, and different governance approaches to dealing with uncertainty.

AB  - Abstract:
Many manufacturers are today striving to offer a large number of value-added PSSs (Product-Service Systems). The increased number of PSS hinders potential buyers from effectively discovering the most suitable PSS to satisfy their personalized requirements. To accurately find the needed or wanted PSS with lower search costs, it is effective to recommend suitable PSS solutions to the right buyers. However, service, a component of PSS, brings more subjective and imprecise information in acquiring users' preferences due to e.g. their different experience and knowledge on services. Moreover, the interactions within user's preferences are often omitted in previous methods, which may lead to inaccurate recommendation results. Therefore, to solve these problems, an innovative method for PSS recommendation is developed. This method explicitly takes into account the environmental aspect of PSSs in question so that a method user can be guided to select an environmentally superior alternative. In addition, rough DEMATEL (Decision-Making and Trial Evaluation Laboratory) is proposed to manipulate the interactions of vague user preferences in multi-criteria weight determination. Furthermore, a rough collaborative filtering approach is developed to make PSS recommendation under vague environment. A case study of elevator PSS recommendation shows the feasibility and potentials of the proposed approach. Theoretically, the new method can produce more reasonable PSS recommendation results by considering the interdependencies between different recommendation criteria. In marketing practice, the method can suggest proposals of new offerings to customers in a proactive manner.

AB  - Design choices with a unilateral focus on the reduction of operational energy for developing energy-efficient and near-zero energy building practices can increase the impact of the embodied energy, as there is a trade-off between embodied and operational energy. Multi-objective optimization approaches enable exploration of the trade-off problems to find sustainable design strategies, but there has been limited research in applying it to find optimal design solution(s) considering the embodied versus operational energy trade-off. Additionally, integration of this approach into a Building Information Modeling (BIM) for facilitating set up of the building model toward optimization and utilizing the benefits of BIM for sharing information in an interoperable and reusable manner, has been mostly overlooked. To address these issues, this paper presents a framework that supports the making of appropriate design decisions by solving the trade-off problem between embodied and operational energy through the integration of a multi-objective optimization approach with a BIM-driven design process. The applicability of the framework was tested by developing a prototype and using it in a case study of a low energy dwelling in Sweden, which showed the potential for reducing the building’s Life Cycle Energy (LCE) use by accounting for the embodied versus operational energy trade-off to find optimal design solution(s). In general, the results of the case study demonstrated that in a low energy dwelling, depending on the site location, small reductions in operational energy (i.e. 140GJ) could result in larger increases in embodied energy (i.e. 340GJ) and the optimization process could yield up to 108GJ of LCE savings relative to the initial design. This energy saving was equivalent to up to 8years of the initial design’s operational energy use for the dwelling, excluding household electricity use.

AB  - In this paper, multi-objective optimization of a multi-bubble pressure cabin in the underwater glider with Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) is carried out using Kriging and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II). Two objective functions are considered: buoyancy-weight ratio and internal volume. Multi-bubble pressure cabin has a strong compressive capacity, and makes full use of the fuselage space. Parametric modeling of the multi-bubble pressure cabin structure is automatic generated using UG secondary development. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is employed to study the structural performance using the commercial software ANSYS. The weight of the primary structure is determined from the volume of the Finite Element Structure (FES). The stress limit is taken into account as the constraint condition. Finally, Technique for Ordering Preferences by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is used to find some trade-off optimum design points from all non-dominated optimum design points represented by the Pareto fronts. The best solution is compared with the initial design results to prove the efficiency and applicability of this optimization method.

The final outcome is a unified framework, called “Multi-Attribute Trust Evaluation and Management” (MATEM), which can be flexibly integrated with a large family of existing routing protocols to ensure secure, reliable and pervasive communication over a hostile DTN. The effectiveness and robustness of MATEM against different security metrics, viz., attack detection, false positive and false negative rates are assessed in the presence of bad-mouthing, good-mouthing, and selfish attacks. The framework efficiency is also evaluated through extensive simulations study and a comparative analysis with other existing frameworks are carried out in terms of different routing metrics, viz., message delivery ratio, delivery latency, and delivery cost. Furthermore, a user experiment is conducted to investigate the impact of MATEM on a real testbed forming a DTN environment. Results generated from simulations and the real testbed verified the usability and user acceptance of MATEM in DTN.

AB  - The transportation sector is one of the most significant sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In order to mitigate climate change, it is important to apply effective and immediate policies to reduce the transportation sector's emissions. This study aims to: (1) define the dimensions of the transportation sector, such as its environmental, economic, social, and political elements, and (2) investigate how they relate to climate change, in order to assess potential mitigation scenarios and policies that could reduce the sector's contribution to climate change. First, sector-related variables were specified using expert opinions and a literature survey. Relationships between the variables and the associated intensity values were then identified using document coding, as well as by gathering expert opinions through a workshop. A fuzzy cognitive map analysis was then conducted to investigate the relationships between the variables and the resulting impacts by the transportation sector on climate change. A scenario analysis was also conducted in order to identify the most effective policies in reducing the impacts of transportation on climate change, at both the local and global levels. For the scenario analysis at the global level, projections by the International Energy Agency were analyzed through the model. The local policy suggestions developed by Turkish authorities were also evaluated using scenario analysis.

AB  - The shared nature of wireless communication, the open access to wireless medium, the tightly coupled design principle of wireless network protocol and the scarcity of radio spectrum make wireless networks vulnerable to different types of jammers, which prevents the normal communication among legitimate nodes by occupying wireless channel or corrupting network protocols’ working process and poses a serious threat to the stability and security of the network. To tackle this security threat, a few anti-jamming schemes have been put forward including channel hopping, spatial retreat, etc. Among these strategies, jammer localization has attracted much attention in recent years since it is very helpful for jamming-avoidance routing and even jammer elimination. However, existing algorithms mainly focus on the localization of jammers equipped with omnidirectional antennas and fail to handle directional jammers, i.e., those attackers with directional antennas. In order to bridge this gap, this paper puts forward an Adaptive Jammer Localization Algorithm (AJLA) which can locating both types of jammers. At first, an identification method is employed to estimate the jammer’s antenna type. If a omnidirectional antenna is adopted, typical existing algorithm, such as Centroid Localization (CL), Virtual Force Iteration Localization (VFIL), can be utilized to locate the jammer. Otherwise, an Improved Gravitational Search Algorithm (IGSA) is developed for directional jammer localization. A series of simulation experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that AJLA-IGSA could locate the directional jammer efficiently and accurately. Besides, the complexity of information collection and localization process are also analyzed by experiments.

AB  - The core of intelligent manufacturing is to incorporate the expert knowledge in manufacturing process, and knowledge transformation is the key to knowledge accumulation and application. In this paper, the research carried on transformation for different granularity knowledge from the cases of sheet metal parts in process planning. First of all, this paper analyzes the difference of organization structure between process data and knowledge in the base. The multi-granularity model of process knowledge is established in the form of tuple, which helps to clarify the hierarchy structure and internal relations. Thereafter, the concrete process is presented to transform single granularity process data into multi-granularity process knowledge, i.e., process data extraction, state determination and knowledge construction. With respect to state determination, similarity measure methods for different granularity knowledge are established to reduce the redundancy in the transformation process. As a novel approach, sequence alignment based on edit distance is proposed to calculate similarity exactly between two process flows. Finally, the knowledge transformation tool for different granularity knowledge is developed to enhance knowledge acquisition and improve the strength of knowledge reuse in fabrication order design for sheet metal parts through application of the above method. Also an example is given to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method.

The approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations under the weakest t-norm (Tω) arithmetic operations to evaluate sustainable supply chain management based on AFDEMATEL. The fuzzy DEMATEL is one of important decision-making method under uncertain environment. The fuzzy DEMATEL had to be developed for clearly display expert’s options with linguistic variables. The fuzzy operations usually adopt α-cut arithmetic in fuzzy DEMATEL. In this research, the fuzzy DEMATEL technology is substituted with the AFDEMATEL technology. In the sustainable supply chain management example, the AFDEMATEL is employed to find fuzzy cause and effect relationships among criteria. Particular note should be made of the following: [1] the fuzzy DEMATEL with α-cut arithmetic model cannot exactly handle fuzzy cause and effect relationships under uncertain environment, and the fuzziness accumulation phenomenon of the α-cut arithmetic may influence final fuzzy cause and effect relationships; and [2] the approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations gives a justifiable fuzziness spread to analyze fuzzy cause and effect relationships. In the case of selection of cans suppliers, the AFDEMATEL examines the influential factors. Proposed method provides justifiable fuzzy cause and effect relationships with approximate fuzzy arithmetic and can analyze across quadrants phenomenon under uncertain environment, since decision-makers usually want to accurately estimate uncertain influential factors.

AB  - The future design of small-to-medium scale district heating networks must integrate policy-related targets while being able to provide a certain energy service to its consumers with profitable business models. Policy targets emphasize cross-cutting developments, like the increase of biomass share and the implementation of demand side measures. This implies the need for multi-goal, optimum design of heat production, whose performance is highly dependent on the yearly heat load profile. In this work, a holistic energy service model is proposed for design optimization of energy supply from a biomass-based heating plant for small-to-medium scale applications. Furthermore a new indicator called “load deviation index” is proposed, which is used (a) for characterization of heat load profiles and (b) for the assessment of the impact of different demand side measures onto optimum design. A review of the actual policy framework and the business implications reveal the need for a holistic future district heating network design, where both demand-side and supply-side services are included. A multi-objective optimization is applied for calculating Pareto-optimum solutions of the heating plant design while the demand side is modelled using the load deviation index. The model is applied to a typical case study, whereas its results are not restricted to it. Generic results are obtained through normalization and provide evidence that demand side measures do not always contribute to higher performance of such systems.

Not only the basic information of projects but also the sunk cost, the network of venture capitalists (VCs), etc., should be considered in the sequential decision-making. In this paper, we study the sequential investment from building a decision-making index system firstly. Then, because of complex and uncertain decision-making circumstance, it is hard for the VCs to give their evaluation information for each alternative as crisp numbers, but it may be easy for them to provide their preferences over each pair of alternatives. Motivated by which, the probabilistic hesitant fuzzy preferences (P-HFPs) are adopted by the VCs in their evaluation process. Moreover, considering the bounded rational psychological characteristic of the VCs in decision-making, the prospect theory has been introduced. Therefore, a prospect consensus with P-HFPs has been constructed due to the grouping of sequential decision-making. It has been applied to a practical case, and an expected consensus under rational framework has been used to analyze the case. The superiority of prospect consensus with P-HFPs has been correspondingly demonstrated in this paper through the comparative analyses of the expected consensus with P-HFPs, the prospect consensus with HFPs and the expected consensus with HFPs.

AB  - New product development (NPD) concept selection is one of the foremost phases in the early stage of NPD to identify the best alternative concept for an enterprise. In practice, not all attributes of NPD concept can be estimated precisely considering inevitable uncertainty associated with the NPD processes. Thus, the NPD concept selection is a hybrid-information multiple attribute decision making (HI-MADM) problem, in which attribute values are represented in various formats (e.g., crisp numbers, interval numbers, and linguistic terms). In the concept selection, psychological behaviors of the NPD team (NPDT) have a non-negligible influence on the accuracy of the final decision. Nevertheless, the decision behaviors are rarely considered in existing studies on the concept selection. In this paper, a risk HI-MADM method based on cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is proposed to select the NPD alternative concepts. Initially, decision information in various formats is normalized and the expectations of the NPDT are set as the corresponding reference points with considering the psychology of the NPDT. Subsequently, the gain and loss matrix relative to the reference points is constructed. Furthermore, the prospect values of concept attributes are calculated based on the value function of CPT. Then, by aggregating prospect values and attribute weights by the simple additive weighting (SAW) method, the comprehensive prospect values of alternative concepts are obtained, and then the ranking order of all concepts can be determined. Finally, a NPD case study of a new automatic dishwasher is used to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach and meanwhile a sensitivity analysis and a comparison analysis are conducted.

AB  - Roads are the lifeline of a nation which provides a reliable and easy access to different areas across the country. Once the roads are constructed, their condition goes on deteriorating with time. Therefore, implementing periodic pavement maintenance is equally important as that of construction for the satisfactory performance throughout their design life. This study develops an approach for pavement condition assessment and their prioritization which can be dealt with a variety of performance indicators for evaluating different aspects of pavement performance. Pavement stretches with low ratings will have a high probability to be scheduled for maintenance and rehabilitation, depending on the availability of funds and the importance of roads. This paper presents two approaches of fuzzy mathematical analysis to conceive strategic planning for maintenance and rehabilitation of pavements. The pavement deterioration condition has been marked by four performance indicators: (a) International Roughness Index (IRI) (b) Surface Modulus (Eo) (c) Rut depth (R) and (d) Friction Coefficient (f). A methodology has been framed to assess condition of Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojna (PMGSY) all weather roads located in Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan, India. These stretches have been prioritized on the basis of their performance parameters using two soft computing techniques: (a) Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and (b) Fuzzy Weighted Average (FWA) method. The results clearly demonstrate that FAHP being more scientific approach can be considered as a base model for assessing the pavement condition, however to have sound decisions, results so obtained are compared effectively from FWA method.

AB  - The high-frequency on-line measurements coming from sensors installed in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) can be used for alert systems and decision support tools. Given the complexity of WWTPs, many authors developed efficient techniques for plant assessment. By contrast, few contributions are focussed on the identification of regime shifts in WWTPs on short-term, even if the early detection of occurring inefficiencies is a relevant information for plant managers. In order to fill this gap, the present paper uses a daily LCA + DEA analysis in order to monitor the potential deterioration of the eco-efficiency. This approach consists of an original combination of environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), data envelopment analysis (DEA), time series analysis and statistical tests. The main innovation in DEA algorithm consists of the set of decision-making units (DMUs), here composed of the 1-day operation datasets of a single WWTP. The results show a good performance in the regime shifts classification, for which the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) analysis returned a score of 0.8 (in a range 0–1).

AB  - Remanufacturing as an end-of-life disposal option poses challenges due to product and process complexities, customer requirements, and uncertainties associated with product take back and the remanufactured products’ market-base. To address these challenges, this study presents a decision support system based on a bi-level fuzzy computing approach that incorporates qualitative and quantitative product attributes in determining the remanufacturability of a product. The model uses fuzzy inference approach in assessing four key performance metrics herein referred to as sub models, namely; technological, economic, resource utilization and environmental metrics that influence product remanufacturability. The four sub-models are then aggregated to establish a unified fuzzy-based remanufacturability index. The model is applied to assess the remanufacturability of two control drive families manufactured by a multi-national company as case examples in this paper. The study shows that one of the control drives, which is larger in size, has been ten years in the market, has a higher percentage of billable returns and thus not relatively labor restrictive, has a higher remanufacturability index of 0.662. The second product, which is relatively small, has been in the market for less than five years, has a higher proportion of returns under warranty and thus labor restrictive, has a lower remanufacturability index of 0.448. The proposed model is versatile for comparing families of product and can therefore aid in making tactical decisions regarding product remanufacture.

AB  - Landslide is one of the most destructive natural hazards of Darjeeling Himalaya. In the present study, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has been applied to develop landslide susceptibility map of the Lish river basin of Eastern Darjiling Himalaya based on geospatial tools. A total of 188 landslide location points of very small to large polygon coverage were identified with the help of GPS study, SOI (Survey of India) topo-sheets and Digital Globe Quick Bird image to prepare a landslide inventory map. 70% training data sets of the landslide inventory was applied for training analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model and remaining 30% data sets were used for validation of the landslide susceptibility map. ERDAS IMAGINE, ASTER GDEM image, Arc GIS and PCI Geomatica software, topographical map, Landsat TM and 8 OLI satellite image, google earth image, soil map (NBSS and LUP Regional Centre), geomorphology and lithology (NATMO and GSI) were used and processed to prepare seventeen causative factors i.e. slope angle, slope aspect, slope curvature, altitude, relative relief, geomorphology, geology, distance to lineaments, lineament density, soil, LAND USE & land cover, NDVI, drainage density, distance o drainage, stream power index, topographic wetness index, and rainfall. Factor weights and class weights of all the data layers were derived using AHP and then weighted data layers were integrated to generate the landslide susceptibility map. To validate the result, success rate curve was made with the help of landslide susceptibility and cumulative percentage of landslide occurrence which showed the accuracy level of 89.72%.

AB  - An integrated design approach for the cost and embodied carbon optimisation of reinforced concrete structures is presented in this paper to inform early design decisions. A BIM-based optimisation approach that utilises Finite Element Modelling (FEM) and a multi-objective genetic algorithm with constructability constraints is established for that purpose. A multilevel engineering analysis model is developed to perform structural layout optimisation, slab and columns sizing optimisation, and slab and columns reinforcement optimisation. The overall approach is validated using real buildings and the relationships between cost and carbon optimum solutions are explored. The study exhibits how cost effective and carbon efficient solutions could be obtained without compromising the feasibility of the optimised designs. Results demonstrate that the structural layout and the slab thickness are amongst the most important design optimisation parameters. Finally, the overall analysis suggests that the building form can influence the relationships between cost and carbon for the different structural components.

AB  - Project Management, as the trans-disciplinary arena with the aim to solve problems through operational strategies and actions, represents a wide technical dominion in which a large number of concepts, tools and approaches (CTAs), have been developed to make effective projects. In this review, I selected a large number of old and recent CTAs scarcely used in operational conservation practices, and included them in the classic Hocking’ IUCN project management cycle. This arrangement has been synthesized in a star-shaped conceptual framework where each CTA has been placed and might be opportunistically utilized, when necessary, in an environmental-based project. For every CTA, I reported the definition with the related basic references, a rationale and some hypothetical and/or real examples in nature conservation, depending on availability of specific literature. I foster a trans-disciplinary use of these operational CTAs to improve the effectiveness of projects and to provide further opportunities for the new generation of professionals.

KW  - Decision support
AB  - Decision analysis is often used to help decision makers choose among alternatives, based on the expected utility associated to each alternative as function of its consequences and potential impacts. Environmental impacts are not always among the prioritized concerns of traditional decision making. This has fostered the development of several environmental problems and is nowadays a reason of concern. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can assess an extensive range of environmental impacts associated with a product or service system and support a life cycle perspective on the alternative products or service systems, revealing potential problem shifting between life cycle stages. Through the integration with traditional risk based decision analysis, LCA may thus facilitate a better informed decision process. In this study we explore how environmental impacts are taken into account in different fields of interest for decision makers to identify the need, potential and obstacles for integrating LCA into conventional approaches to decision problems. Three application areas are used as examples: transportation planning, flood management, and food production and consumption. The analysis of these cases shows that environmental impacts are considered only to a limited extent in traditional evaluation of transport and food projects. They are rarely, if at all, addressed in flood risk management. Hence, in each of the three cases studied, there is a clear need for the inclusion of a better and systematic assessment of environmental impacts. Some LCA studies have been conducted in all three research areas, mainly on infrastructures and production systems. The three cases show the potential of integrating LCA into existing decision analysis by providing the environmental profiles of the alternatives. However, due to different goals and scopes of LCA and other decision analysis approaches, there is a general lack of consistency in study system scoping in terms of considered elements and boundaries, in uncertainty treatment, and in applied metrics. In the present paper, we discuss the obstacles arising when trying to integrate LCA with conventional evaluation tools and we propose a research agenda to eventually make such integration feasible and consistent.

AB  - This study develops an integrated model for dynamically predicting the energy potential of straw resources and assessing regional energy, environmental, and socioeconomic benefits of straw utilization for energy production. Jilin Province, China is taken as an empirical study area. The quantity of straw resources is estimated by principal component analysis and autoregressive integrated moving average model considering panel data of six influential factors and grain yield. The regional energy, environmental, and socioeconomic benefits of straw utilization through three bioenergy conversion technologies (direct-combustion power generation, briquette fuel and cellulosic fuel ethanol) are quantitatively evaluated referring to Global Bioenergy Partnership's sustainability indicators. The results indicate that the quantity of straw available for energy production has continuous rising trend spanning 15 years (2016–2030) and could amount to 47.10 million t (Mt) by 2030. According to local government planning within 15 years, three straw-energy industries could contribute to a net profit of 2.2 billion USD. The accumulative mitigation amount of greenhouse gases, SO2, NOx and PM2.5 is 700.25 Mt, 3.99 Mt, 2.05 Mt and 3.94 Mt, respectively in contrast to fossil fuels burning and open-burning of straw. In total 166.05 thousand employments could be created. The methods and results presented are expected to provide decision makers with guidance for regional development of bioenergy industries.

AB  - Healthcare is a highly institutionalized industry, subject to multiple regulatory forces, high levels of professionalism, and growing network externalities which may affect the decisions to adopt. Hence, this research integrates the Resource Dependence Theory (RDT), institutional theory along with Human Organization Technology (HOT) fit model as the organization theories to explain the adoption of Hospital Information System (HIS). To examine the effects of inter and intra-organizational potential factors on HIS adoption, within the context of Malaysian public hospitals, a survey method using web-based questionnaire is employed. The role of hospital size in this study is investigated to determine its distinct moderating influence among the relationships of the HIS adoption and significant dimensional factors. The results indicated that system affiliation (p < 0.05), mimetic pressure-competitors (p < 0.1), normative pressure (p < 0.05), and employees' IS knowledge (p < 0.05) were the most significant drivers for adopting HIS in the public hospitals of Malaysia. The results also showed that hospital size as the only moderator of this study has no significant effect on the other relationships in our developed theoretical model. In other words, the effects of the significant factors on HIS adoption are the same in three small, medium, and large Malaysian public hospitals. This research presents a conceptual foundation for future researches and fills a gap in the literature regarding the inter-organizational factors influencing the adoption of HIS.

AB  - City residence development in China is increasing at an annual rate of 0.5–0.6 billion m2, causing vast increases in energy consumption by HVAC facilities and other appliances. Thus, governments and researchers are encouraging the use of renewable energy sources such as solar and geothermal energy in residential areas. However, high equipment costs and low energy conversion efficiency have reduced their acceptability to residents. Thus, researchers must determine the eco-feedback equilibrium point that achieves both economic benefit and thermal comfort. The objective of this study is to design and build a nearly zero-energy building (NZEB) with an HVAC system and an onsite solar photovoltaic system. Because HVAC systems typically account for more than 40% of total energy consumption in residences, a 24 h monitoring system was installed in the considered residential setting to measure the temperature, wind velocity, and energy in-out value with/without the HVAC system for several days in summer and winter. The thermal comfort period was analyzed and confirmed, and the air conditioner was switched on during thermal discomfort periods in one summer and one winter month. Temperature, humidity, wind, and energy data was recorded to calculate the average monthly energy consumption that provides all-day thermal comfort. Finally, two analyses were conducted; first, the real measured temperature after construction was recorded for thermal comfort analysis; second, the cost of renewable energy facilities and power consumption was converted to cost efficient rates to assess the feasibility of renewable energy input for the residence. The results of the experiment showed that the house could achieve better thermal comfort in summer than in winter. Contrary to our assumptions, energy consumption was highest in September and October rather than in July and August. Moreover, with a payback period of approximately 11 year, the cost-effectiveness is high for a house in the city of Guilin.

AB  - Ranking historical players in sports is challenging since some players have never played against each other. It is even more complex in Go because of AlphaGo, a project based on artificial intelligence, who became the world's number 1 after it defeated the 528th and the 4th human Go players. AlphaGo is ranked high in the current Go ranking system because it is undefeated. The objective of this paper is to propose a new ranking method for large-scale Go players by means of incomplete fuzzy pair-wise comparison matrix whose priority vector is derived using a cosine similarity measure. Using match results provided by Go4Go.net, experiments are designed to rank top Go players in the past 45 years and examine the change in ranking after AlphaGo faced off against Jie Ke. Furthermore, the proposed method was applied to rank all 1544 Go players available at Go4Go.net to illustrate its efficiency in handling large-scale data.

The paper investigated an integrated decision-support framework using Quality Function Deployment (QFD) in structural design optimisation. The aim of the study was to develop and test a systematic participatory model that utilises Building Information Modelling (BIM)-enabled technologies for data collection and group decision-making theory. The uncertainties associated with the decision-makers’ preferences were computed using Evidential Reasoning (ER) algorithms in the QFD house of quality. An actual decision scenario was used to test the proposed framework and investigate its capabilities in the context of reinforced concrete buildings. The study demonstrated how the proposed QFD model could effectively enhance decision-making by managing the diversity of stakeholders’ preferences via design integration, enhanced communication and shared domain knowledge.

AB  - A fuzzy rule based inference model assessing the failure modes for risk ranking in FMEA to manage risks and make maintenance decisions is applied to a LPG refuelling station in this paper. Normally in FMEA, risk priority number (RPN) is determined by multiplication of feature scores that are inferred from the degree or probability of occurrence, severity and non detection of the problem, without taking into consideration the relative importance of factors. In fuzzy approach, linguistic assessment of factors is evaluated to obtain risk priority number. A rule based fuzzy inference engine generates the priority ranks of identified failure modes. Direct evaluation is possible with the aid of grey theory by assigning weights to the features in the absence of expertise to develop an inference rule base. The GRA approaches can solve the problem of risk prioritising, which needs expertise to develop rule base while building the fuzzy inference system. By applying fuzzy FMEA and fuzzy logic with grey relational approach (GRA), expert linguistic opinions are used to rank the identified failure modes and the results are presented. The risk of the failure modes are ranked in an inclusive approach based on the fuzzy domain projections. It is effective and feasible to handle various types of uncertainties, such as incompleteness, fuzziness, imprecision, and so on, in the risk analysis process.

AB  - Sustainable development and sustainability assessment have been of great interest to both academe and practitioners in the past decades. In this study, we review the literature on data envelopment analysis (DEA) applications in sustainability using citation-based approaches. A directional network is constructed based on citation relationships among DEA papers published in journals indexed by the Web of Science database from 1996 to March 2016. We first draw the citation chronological graph to present a complete picture of literature development trajectory since 1996. Then we identify the local main DEA development paths in sustainability research by assigning an importance index, namely search path count (SPC), to each link in the citation network. The local main path suggests that the current key route of DEA applications in sustainability focus on the environmental sustainability. Through the Kamada–Kawai layout algorithm, we find four research clusters in the literature including corporate sustainability assessment, regional sustainability assessment, sustainability composite indicator construction, and sustainability performance analysis. For each of the clusters, we further identify the key articles based on citation network and local citation scores, demonstrate the developmental trajectory of the literature, and suggest future research directions.

AB  - The current manufacturing environment aims at getting an increasing variety of customised, high-quality products in flexible batches. The dynamic market demand, the short product lifecycle and the flexibility need mark the transition from the traditional manufacturing systems to the so-called Next Generation Manufacturing Systems (NGMSs). Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMSs) are within NGMSs and seem to match to these current market trends. RMSs allow rapid change in structure, hardware and software configuration to adjust, promptly, their production capacity and functionality. This paper presents a structured and updated systematic review of the literature about RMSs, highlighting the application areas as well as the key methodologies and tools. The review further provides a schematic of RMS research, identifying five emerging and promising research streams ranging from conceptual models to empirical applications. Compared to previous reviews, focusing on specific aspects of the RMS design and management, this study covers multiple areas and topics and it links reconfigurable manufacturing to the upcoming Industry 4.0 fourth industrial revolution. Finally, important issues and new trends in the literature are outlined to stimulate researchers and practitioners in developing studies in this field strongly linked to the Industry 4.0 environment.

AB  - This article aims to uncover knowledge gaps regarding approaches to dynamic complexity and deep uncertainty in a transition towards closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) management, and it articulates future research challenges addressing the identified gaps. Based on an abductive approach, two concepts are investigated: ‘deep uncertainty’ from the perspective of the decision-support literature and ‘dynamic complexity’ from the perspective of the complex adaptive systems literature and the transition management literature. The result is a systematic literature review of 64 CLSC management articles published in English. Conceptual gaps, process gaps and methodological gaps were found in relation to CLSC management under deep uncertainty and dynamic complexity. The analysis results in concrete research challenges for the CLSC management and sustainable supply chain management domains. The added value of this article is that the concepts of deep uncertainty and dynamic complexity for CLSC management are explored systematically for the first time. These two concepts appear to be crucial for the analysis of transitions to CLSC management.

AB  - Digital competence has become increasing importance for social and individual since the 20th century. Due to the spread of digital devices and the Internet, the basic IT knowledge is essential for everybody. Different defence mechanisms have emerged against the danger of the material world. The cyber era started only a few decades ago. Civil people are not aware of attacks in the Cyber space and they can’t survey its danger. In Hungary the information technology and the Internet penetration started in the last some decades. “Gen X” and older generation people users only in theirs adulthood met digital devices and its application. For the said generations to find a workplace was not required the digital competence, because the digital devices and the digital infrastructure wasn’t available for everybody. This age-group has not enough motivation to improve the digital competence and herewith develop the safety awareness too. Nowadays this age-group needs significant helps to correspond to the challenge of the digital world. The digital competence and the safety awareness are improvable by the way of education. The knowledge levels are very different between the same age users. The assessment and the determination of the levels are a complex problem.

AB  - Agile manufacturing has successfully established its importance in dealing with dynamic demand of customer and market. A survey based study has been conducted with an aim to identify main predictors of agile manufacturing enablers and to develop a model for agile manufacturing enablers. The framed hypotheses for the four sections of agility enablers were tested by ANOVA. Four sections of enabler were organization’s people, organization’s virtual integration & collaboration, organization’s information technology & communication, and organization’s tools & technology. Principal component analysis was applied to identify main components of agile enablers. Stepwise linear regression analysis was used to generate model for agile manufacturing enablers. Analytical hierarchy process has been used to rank the variables of components pictured in linear regression model. Afterward, a complete regression model has been prepared with the help of priority vectors generated by AHP. The variables information system interface with customers, employee’s empowerment, sharing of concepts and CAD/CAM found as the most important agile enablers. Therefore, these agile enables need high attention to make an organization agile. The status of agile enablers in Indian manufacturing industries has been calculated and it is found that the level of agile enablers in Indian manufacturing industries is quite low.

AB  - Cities are the major contributors to energy consumption and CO2 emissions, as well as being leading innovators and implementers of policy measures in climate change mitigation. Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is an agglomeration of cities put forward by China to strengthen international cooperation among “Belt and Road” countries and promote low-carbon, inclusive, coordinated and sustainable development. Few studies have discussed the emission characteristics of GBA cities. This study, for the first time, compiles emission inventories of 11 GBA cities and their surroundings based on IPCC territorial emission accounting approach, which are consistent and comparable with the national and provincial inventories. Results show that (a) total emissions increased from 426 Mt in 2000 to 610 Mt in 2016, while emissions of GBA cities increased rapidly by 6.9% over 2000–2011 and peaked in 2014 (334 Mt); (b) raw coal and diesel oil are the top two emitters by energy type, while energy production sector and tertiary industry are the top two largest sectors; (c) GBA cities take the lead in low-carbon development, emitted 4% of total national emissions and contributed 13% of national GDP with less than a third of national emission intensities and less than three-quarters of national per capita emissions; (d) Macao, Shenzhen and Hong Kong have the top three lowest emission intensity in the country; (e) most of GBA cities are experiencing the shift from an industrial economy to a service economy, while Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Foshan and Huizhou reached their peak emissions and Guangzhou, Dongguan and Jiangmen remained decreasing emission tendencies; (g) for those coal-dominate or energy-production cities (i.e. Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Zhaoqing, Maoming, Yangjiang, Shanwei, Shaoguan and Zhanjiang) in mid-term industrialization, total emissions experienced soaring increases. The emission inventories provide robust, self-consistent, transparent and comparable data support for identifying spatial–temporal emission characteristics, developing low-carbon policies, monitoring mitigation progress in GBA cities as well as further emissions-related studies at a city-level. The low-carbon roadmaps designed for GBA cities and their surroundings also provide a benchmark for other developing countries/cities to adapting changing climate and achieve sustainable development.

AB  - In the blooming era of Pervasive and Mobile Computing, trust has been accepted as a vital factor for provisioning secure, reliable and seamless communications between pervasive computing elements. However, advancing research in the area of trust-based protocol for distributed Pervasive and Mobile Computing might be challenging due to the ambiguity of the concept of trust as well as the variety of divergent trust models, protocols and algorithms in different contexts. In this research, we augment the trust concept and definition from various field of studies and proposed models in the literature and provide general conceptual phases and methods of trust management toward-trust-based protocols, in the context of Pervasive and Mobile Computing. The paper addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, applications and desired futures of trust-based protocols. A number of the currently used trust-based protocols are critically reviewed, and this further leads our discussion to the security attacks and mitigation strategies used with trust-based protocols for pervasive and mobile computing. Finally, the paper discusses open research issues.

AB  - The emergence of mobile technology has influenced many service industries including health care. Mobile health (m-Health) applications have been used widely, and many services have been developed that have changed delivery systems and have improved effectiveness of health care services. Stakeholders of m-Health services have various resources and rights that lends to a complexity in service delivery. In addition, abundance of different m-Health services makes it difficult to choose an appropriate service for these stakeholders that include customers, patients, users or even providers. Moreover, a comprehensive framework is not yet provided in the literature that would help manage and evaluate m-health services, considering various stakeholder's benefits. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review has been done on famous frameworks and models in the field of Information Technology and electronic health with the aim of finding different aspects of developing and managing m-health services. Using the results of literature review and conducting a stakeholder analysis, we have proposed an m-health evaluation framework which evaluates the success of a given m-health service through a three-stage life cycle: (1) Service Requirement Analysis, (2) Service Development, and (3) Service Delivery. Key factors of m-health evaluation in each step are introduced in the proposed framework considering m-health key stakeholder's benefits. The proposed framework is validated via expert interviews, and key factors in each evaluation step is validated using PLS model. Results show that path coefficients are higher than their threshold which supports the validity of proposed framework.

KW  - Computer model
AB  - After designing the final range of open pit mines, one of the first essential decisions to be made in the production planning framework is to determine the cutoff grade. The cutoff grade of mines, due to interconnections with technical and economic parameters, is one of the most important parameters for the design of open pit mines. Considering the fundamental role of plant cutoff grade on the economical operation of a mine, the optimal selection of this grade is of great importance. One of the main problems in mining operations is how to determine the optimal cutoff grades of ore deposits at different periods during the life of a mine, it can be considered based on one of the goals of maximizing annual profit or net present value extraction during the mining period. Despite the existence of a range of different techniques for determining the optimal cutoff grade, Lane's algorithm is usually the most widely used cutoff grade optimization technique, which is calculated taking into account the technical and economic factors of production. Cutoff grade optimization with the goal of maximizing the net present value over the years of the mine's life, as well as the correlation with the distribution of the grade and tonnage of the remaining ore, requires a long calculation process, especially for large mines. In this research, optimal cutoff grade programming based on Lane's theory and aimed at maximizing the net present value in MATLAB software (computer model) has been carried out. Mineral operations consist of three phases: mining, processing, and refining. In single-product and single-process mode, the optimum cut-off grade and the net present value of production are calculated for each year of the mine's life. After validating the outputs of the model, the implementation of the computer model based on the data of Gol Gohar iron mine No.1 in a five-year plan was carried out. The changes in optimal cutoff grade and changes in net present value from 48.65% to 18,582 billion rials in the early years of the mine increased to 40.5% and approximately 3000 billion rials at the end of the mine's life.

AB  - Given the increasing number of brownfields in China, the Chinese government is now facing a huge financing gap in brownfield remediation projects. Accordingly, the authors present a framework that can assist a provincial government in classifying its brownfields so that the funding can be appropriately allocated. More specifically, the framework starts from constructing a criteria system based on the existing literature and expert opinions. Then, in consonance with the criteria system, a sample set of brownfields is measured by experts and then trained using a Dominance-Based Rough Set Approach to derive judging rules. After the validation, those rules are employed to generate an ordinal classification of the complete set of brownfields. The resulting ordinal classification provides the government with a sequence of brownfields from the highest priority to the lowest, which can support the government in budgeting and planning. Furthermore, as the number and conditions of the brownfields change over time, the criteria system and corresponding categories can be updated and reapplied at the beginning of each fiscal year (or each planning horizon) to facilitate the government’s decision making. The proposed decision process can also be applied to assist the investment decisions of any brownfield stakeholders in other counties with limited funding based on their specific preference.

AB  - Markowitz’s return–risk model for stock portfolio selection is based on the historical return data of assets. In addition to the effect of historical return, there are many other critical factors which directly or indirectly influence the stock market. We use the fuzzy Delphi method to identify the critical factors initially. Factors having lower correlation coefficients are finally considered for further consideration. The critical factors and historical data are used to apply Dempster–Shafer evidence theory to rank the stocks. Then, a portfolio selection model that prefers stocks with higher rank is proposed. Illustration is done using stocks under Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). Simulation is done by Ant Colony Optimization. The performance of the outcome is found satisfactory when compared with recent performance of the assets.
