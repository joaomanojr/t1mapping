abstract = {Attributing the culprit of a cyber-attack is widely considered one of the major technical and policy challenges of cyber-security. The lack of ground truth for an individual responsible for a given attack has limited previous studies. Here, we overcome this limitation by leveraging DEFCON capture-the-flag (CTF) exercise data where the actual ground-truth is known. In this work, we use various classification techniques to identify the culprit in a cyberattack and find that deceptive activities account for the majority of misclassified samples. We also explore several heuristics to alleviate some of the misclassification caused by deception.},

abstract = {Many optimization problems are multiobjective in nature in the sense that multiple, conflicting criteria need to be optimized simultaneously. Due to the conflict between objectives, usually, no single optimal solution exists. Instead, the optimum corresponds to a set of so-called Pareto-optimal solutions for which no other solution has better function values in all objectives.Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO) algorithms are widely used in practice for solving multiobjective optimization problems due to several reasons. As randomized blackbox algorithms, EMO approaches allow to tackle problems with nonlinear, nondifferentiable, or noisy objective functions. As set-based algorithms, they allow to compute or approximate the full set of Pareto-optimal solutions in one algorithm run&amp;emdash;opposed to classical solution-based techniques from the multicriteria decision making (MCDM) field. Using EMO approaches in practice has two other advantages: they allow to learn about a problem formulation, for example, by automatically revealing common design principles among (Pareto-optimal) solutions (innovization) and it has been shown that certain single-objective problems become easier to solve with randomized search heuristics if the problem is reformulated as a multiobjective one (multiobjectivization).This tutorial aims at giving a broad introduction to the EMO field and at presenting some of its recent research results in more detail. More specifically, we are going to (i) introduce the basic principles of EMO algorithms in comparison to classical solution-based approaches, (ii) show a few practical examples which motivate the use of EMO in terms of the mentioned innovization and multiobjectivization principles, and (iii) present a general overview of state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques. Moreover, we will present some of the most important research results in areas such as indicator-based EMO, preference articulation, surrogate-assisted EMO, and performance assessment.Though classified as introductory, this tutorial is intended for both novices and regular users of EMO. Those without any knowledge will learn about the foundations of multiobjective optimization and the basic working principles of state-of-the-art EMO algorithms. Open questions, presented throughout the tutorial, can serve for all participants as a starting point for future research and/or discussions during the conference.},

abstract = {Managing Service Level Agreement (SLA) within a cloud-based system is important to maintain service continuity and improve trust due to cloud flexibility and scalability. We conduct a general review on cloud-based systems to understand how service continuity and trust are addressed in cloud SLA management. The review shows that SLA renegotiation is necessary to improve trust and maintain service continuity; however, research on SLA renegotiation is limited. Of the two key approaches in renegotiation, namely bargaining-based negotiation and offer generation--based negotiation, the latter approach is the most promising due to its ability to generate optimized multiple-offer SLA parameters within one round during renegotiation.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the use of different evolutionary inheritance mechanisms for the adaptation of parameters in a multi-agent system where the agents have to solve tasks that are distributed within a dynamic environment. In the studied system the agents have to form teams to execute the tasks. Deciding which task to execute next is a multi-criteria decision problem for which the agents use different ranking schemes. Agents that have successfully executed several tasks can reproduce and pass the type of ranking scheme they have used and some corresponding parameter values to their successors. Three types of evolutionary mechanisms are compared: haploid, diploid, and haplo-diploid. The latter one is new for multi-agent systems. The focus of our simulation experiments is to study the influence of the different evolutionary mechanisms on the diversity of the agents and on the resulting efficiency of the multi-agent system for different dynamic environments.},
