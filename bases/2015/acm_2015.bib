abstract = {In this paper we study the use of different evolutionary inheritance mechanisms for the adaptation of parameters in a multi-agent system where the agents have to solve tasks that are distributed within a dynamic environment. In the studied system the agents have to form teams to execute the tasks. Deciding which task to execute next is a multi-criteria decision problem for which the agents use different ranking schemes. Agents that have successfully executed several tasks can reproduce and pass the type of ranking scheme they have used and some corresponding parameter values to their successors. Three types of evolutionary mechanisms are compared: haploid, diploid, and haplo-diploid. The latter one is new for multi-agent systems. The focus of our simulation experiments is to study the influence of the different evolutionary mechanisms on the diversity of the agents and on the resulting efficiency of the multi-agent system for different dynamic environments.},

abstract = {Multi-criteria decision making problem has been well studied for many years. One popular query for multi-criteria decision making is top-k queries which require each user to specify an exact utility function. In many cases, the utility function of a user is probabilistic and finding the distribution on the utility functions has been widely explored in the machine learning areas, such as user's recommender systems, Bayesian learning models and user's preference elicitation, for improving user's experience. Motivated by this, we propose a new type of queries called k-hit queries, which has not been studied before. Given a set D of tuples in the database, the distribution θ on utility functions and a positive integer k, we would like to select a set of k tuples from D in order to maximize the probability that at least one of tuples in the selection set is the favorite of a user. All applications for top-k queries can naturally be used in k-hit queries. In this paper, we present various interesting properties of k-hit queries. Besides, based on these properties, we propose a novel algorithm called k-hit_Alg for k-hit queries. Finally, we conducted comprehensive experiments to show that the performance of our proposed method, k hit_Alg, is superior compared with other existing algorithms which were originally used to answer other existing queries.},

Modern design tools and material databases should be more scalable, reliable, and accessible to take full advantage of the quantity of available building data. New approaches providing well-structured information can lead to robust decision support for architectural simulations earlier in the design process; rule-based decision engines and knowledge bases are the link between current data and useful decision frameworks. Integrating distributed API-based systems means that material data silos existing in modern tools can become enriched and extensible for future use with additional data from building documents, other databases, and the minds of design professionals. The PyKE rules engine extension to the Green Scale (GS) Tool improves material searches, creates the opportunity for incorporating additional rules via a REST interface, and enables integration with the Semantic Web via Linked Data principles.},

abstract = {As we are in the big data era, techniques for retrieving only user-desirable data objects from massive and diverse datasets is being required. Ranking queries, e.g., top-k queries, which rank data objects based on a user-specified scoring function, enable to find such interesting data for users, and have received significant attention due to its wide range of applications. While many techniques for both centralized and distributed top-k query processing have been developed, they do not consider query keywords, i.e., simply retrieving k data with the best score. Utilizing keywords, on the other hand, is a common approach in data (and information) retrieval. Despite of this fact, there is no study on retrieving top-k data containing all query keywords. We define, in this paper, a new query which enriches the conventional top-k queries, and propose some algorithms to solve the novel problem of how to efficiently retrieve k data objects with the best score and all query from distributed databases. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic data have demonstrated the efficiency and scalability of our algorithms in terms of communication cost and running time.},

abstract = {Welcome to SIGMOD 2015 -- officially, the 2015 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on the Management of Data! This year's conference is being held in the beautiful cultural capital of Australia, Melbourne. During the Gold Rush period of the 19th Century, Melbourne was the richest city in the world, and as a result it is filled with many unique neighborhoods and distinctive buildings. In addition to wonderful neighborhoods to explore, the city has great museums and other cultural attractions, as well as a fine multi-cultural atmosphere. For those who would like to explore the outdoors, popular highlights are the Phillip Island Nature Park (90 minutes away), which features wild penguins who return in a parade each day at sunset, and the Great Ocean Road, one of the world's most scenic coastal drives, including the famous towering 12 Apostles.SIGMOD 2015's exciting technical program reflects not only traditional topics, but the database community's role in broader data science and data analytics. The keynote from Laura Haas, "The Power Behind the Throne: Information Integration in the Age of Data-Driven Discovery" highlights the role of database and data integration techniques in the growing field of data science. Jignesh Patel's talk, "From Data to Insights @ Bare Metal Speed," explains how hardware and software need to be co-evolved to support the needs of scalable data analytics. Jennifer Widom, winner of the 2015 ACM-W Athena Lecturer Award for fundamental contributions to computer science, will give her award talk, "Three Favorite Results," on Tuesday. Christopher R\'{e} will lead a panel on "Machine Learning and Databases: The Sound of Things to Come or a Cacophony of Hype?," with participants Divyakant Agrawal, Magdalena Balazinska, Michael Cafarella, Michael Jordan, Tim Kraska, and Raghu Ramakrishnan. Of course, there are also 106 research paper presentations, 4 tutorials, 30 demonstrations, and 18 industrial papers. Papers will be presented both as talks during the research sessions, and as part of plenary Poster Sessions.SIGMOD 2015 is preceded by the PhD Workshop, as well as workshops on leading-edge topics like data analytics (DanaC), databases and the Web (WebDB), exploratory search (ExploreDB), managing and mining spatial data (GeoRich), and graph data (GRADES); the New Researcher Symposium will take place on Wednesday. The banquet will be held in a Melbourne landmark, the Town Hall.As in recent years, we had two submission deadlines for SIGMOD this year, one in August and one in November. The review process was journal-style, with multiple rounds of reviews coordinated by the Group Leaders. We accepted 34 of 137 papers from the first deadline and 72 of 278 from the second deadline. The total acceptance rate was about 25.5%, and we believe that the revision processhas improved the quality of the technical program.},

abstract = {A recent trend in evolutionary algorithms (EAs) transfers expertise from and to other areas of machine learning. An interesting novel symbiosis considers: i) reinforcement learning (RL), which learns on-line and off-line difficult dynamic elaborated tasks requiring lots of computational resources, and ii) EAs with the main strength its eloquence and computational efficiency. These two techniques address the same problem of reward maximization in difficult environments that can include stochasticity. Sometimes, they exchange techniques in order to improve their theoretical and empirical efficiency, like computational speed for on-line learning, and robust behaviour for the off-line optimisation algorithms. For example, multi-objective RL uses tuples of rewards instead of a single reward value and techniques from multi-objective EAs should be integrated for an efficient exploration/exploitation trade-off. The problem of selecting the best genetic operator is similar to the problem an agent faces when choosing between alternatives in achieving its goal of maximising its cumulative expected reward. Practical approaches select the RL method that solve the best online operator selection problem.},

abstract = {This paper describes a decision support system (DSS) built on knowledge extraction using simulation-based optimization and data mining. The paper starts with a requirements analysis based on a survey conducted with a number of industrial companies about their practices of using simulations for decision support. Based upon the analysis, a new, interactive DSS that can fulfill the industrial requirements, is proposed. The design of the cloud-based system architecture of the DSS is then described. To show the functionality and potential of the proposed DSS, an application study has been performed for the optimal design of a hypothetical but realistic flexible production cell. How important knowledge with respect to different preferences of the decision maker can be generated as rules, using the new Flexible Pattern Mining algorithm provided in the DSS, will be revealed by the results of this application study.},

abstract = {The growth in the number of cloud computing users has led to the availability of a variety of cloud based services provided by different vendors. This has made the task of selecting a suitable set of services quite difficult. There has been a lot of research towards the development of suitable decision support system (DSS) to assist users in making an optimal selection of cloud services. However, existing decision support systems cannot address two crucial issues: firstly, the involvement of both business and technical perspectives in decision making simultaneously and, secondly, the multiple-clouds services based selection using a single DSS. In this paper, we tackle these issues in the light of solving the problem of cloud service discovery. In particular, we present the following novel contributions: Firstly, we present a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art in decision support systems. Based on our analysis, we identify critical shortcomings in the existent tools and develop the set of requirements which should be met by a potential DSS. Secondly, we present a new holistic framework for the development of DSS which allows a pragmatic description of user requirements. Additionally, the data gathering and analysis is studied as an integral part of the proposed DSS and therefore, we present concrete algorithms to assess the data for an optimal service discovery. Thirdly, we assess our framework for applicability to cloud service selection using an industrial case study. We also demonstrate the implementation and performance of our proposed framework using a prototype which serves as a proof of concept. Overall, this paper provides a novel and holistic framework for development of a multiple cloud service discovery based decision support system.},

This study presents exploratory survey results for the purpose of examining value-based factors that are most commonly used in software development. The survey conducted at the Malaysian public sector involving a software development team as the target population. Exploratory factor analysis was used as the main data analysis strategy in this study. The results reveal that there are 28 value-based factors that are most commonly used in software development which can be classified into four classifications (success-critical stakeholders, business strategy, project characteristics and product characteristics). Our objective in further research is to develop value-based factors profile as imperative input to conduct software process tailoring.},

Therefore, more attention has been given to multiple objective scheduling problems. In this paper, we use a genetic algorithms to solve job shop scheduling problems with alternative routes and dynamic job arrival in order to simultaneously minimize the maximum lateness and makespan. Firstly, genetic algorithms have been applied to find a set of optimum feasible solutions for the makespan criterion. Individuals or solutions with values less than or equal to the value of maximum lateness with minimum makespan are then used to form the initial population in genetic algorithms for the second criterion in order to minimize the maximum lateness. A method of finding non-dominated solutions is then proposed, and weighted-sum is used to find the most desirable solution based on the weight of each criteria. Finally the model is tested using different instances, with the obtained results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method to solve bicriteria dynamic job shop scheduling problems with alternative routes.},

abstract = {Skyline computation, aiming at identifying a set of skyline points that are not dominated by any other point, is particularly useful for multi-criteria data analysis and decision making. Traditional skyline computation, however, is inadequate to answer queries that need to analyze not only individual points but also groups of points. To address this gap, we generalize the original skyline definition to the novel group-based skyline (G-Skyline), which represents Pareto optimal groups that are not dominated by other groups. In order to compute G-Skyline groups consisting of k points efficiently, we present a novel structure that represents the points in a directed skyline graph and captures the dominance relationships among the points based on the first k skyline layers. We propose efficient algorithms to compute the first k skyline layers. We then present two heuristic algorithms to efficiently compute the G-Skyline groups: the point-wise algorithm and the unit group-wise algorithm, using various pruning strategies. The experimental results on the real NBA dataset and the synthetic datasets show that G-Skyline is interesting and useful, and our algorithms are efficient and scalable.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, an increasing number of organizations have started software development in a globally distributed environment. One of the major challenges is that many organizations endorse the process of global software development without testing their management readiness for the globally distributed development activity. This includes work distribution through task allocation in the globally distributed development environment. The objective of this research paper is to identify factors that influence task allocation in global software development through carrying out a systematic literature review. We used customized search terms, derived from our research question, to identify literature on work distribution and task allocation in a global context. We identified criteria such as site technical expertise, time zone difference, resource cost, task dependency, vendor reliability, task size and vendor maturity level as key task allocation factors in globally distributed software projects. Based on the systematic literature review results, we suggest that there is a need to develop work distribution strategies and standards through global task allocation to help software development organizations in achieving the true potential of global software development at lower development costs and shorter time-to-market.},
