AB  - Manufacturing industries are crucial in a country's economy. However, they accounts for huge resource consumption of and waste excretion. The objective of this study was to investigate sustainability issues pertinent to turning process in a Indian machining industry. Parameters such as surface roughness, material removal rate and energy consumption were considered as sustainability factors. The effect of process parameters (speed/feed/depth of cut), the machining environment (dry/MQL/wet) and the type of cutting tool on the response was observed. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was applied to test the data. The process was analysed using response surface methodology (RSM). The results of the study helped to understand the effect of the cutting parameters on surface finish, energy consumption, and material removal rate. The process was optimized from power consumption point of view. Extended form of the model could be useful to predict the environmental impact of machining process which will bring environmental concern into conventional machining.

AB  - There are many sinkholes (182) in the vicinity of Karapınar. Approximately 20 large sinkholes (>10m in diameter) were formed within the Obruk Plateau between 1970 and 2012. The formation of sinkholes is the most important geological hazard in the study area because they can damage engineering structures, settlements, agricultural areas, and eventually be a source of casualties. To date, no study has been conducted on the distribution of sinkholes in this region. In this study, the spatial distribution of the sinkholes and the factors controlling sinkhole development were studied through the use of geographical information systems using a sinkhole inventory and a spatial database containing information on the topography, geology, hydrogeology, and land use. Initially, 182 sinkholes were identified in the area by examining the digital elevation model produced for this study. The sinkholes were verified in the field. Thirty-two factor maps were produced to investigate their relationship with sinkholes using the weights of evidence method. The sinkholes are mainly related to dissolution of the Neogene-age lacustrine Insuyu Formation, consisting of limestone and clayey limestone. Sinkhole frequency increases in the vicinity of drainages (2000–3000m) and faults (<1000m) and in areas with lower cover thickness (<50m). Injuries and property losses caused by sinkhole formation may be prevented or reduced by producing sinkhole susceptibility and risk maps considered the identified controlling factors.

AB  - The area of e-commerce based supply chains (or e-supply chains) has received significant attention in the last two decades. Despite the high level of activity, the most recent reviews on this topic date back to the beginning of this century. In this paper, we analyzed the state of e-supply chain research published during January 2000–January 2015 AD, covering 165 articles from 47 ISI indexed journals. The analysis is performed using a five-dimensional framework comprising Topic-of-Study, Unit-of-Analysis, Research Perspective, Industry Type, and Research Method. Within these dimensions, Topic-of-Study plays a pivotal role, whereas the other four dimensions are analyzed around its sub-classification scheme. Our main objective is to establish a broader interdisciplinary understanding of the e-supply chain research domain, and to identify trends and gaps in contemporary e-supply chain theory and practice. The findings indicate that problems are addressed from different perspectives with varying levels of interest from researchers belonging to several academic disciplines including business, economics, engineering and social sciences. Our analysis also identified two distinct periods (2000–2006 and 2007 onwards) with different foci of research attention. The problems that received significant attention in the earlier period include innovation, adoption and barriers, and supply chain integration; while in the latter period, the focus seemed to have shifted towards supply chain integration and collaboration issues. Problems that received minimum interest across the two periods include customer relationship, economic and environmental impact.

Numerical experiments for the application of the method in urban planning are carried out. Multiple assessments of land parcels in St.Petertsburg (Russia) suburbs is calculated and mapped. Complex evaluations of land parcels have been carried out by fuzzy model with the use of four criteria (technological, economical, ecological and social) for two special tasks: 1) ecological criterion is more important and 2) economical criterion is more significant. The results show the opportunity of the land parcels ranging for decision making support.

AB  - We are considering induction of ordinal classification rules, which assign objects to preference-ordered decision classes, within the dominance-based rough set approach. In order to extract such rules, it is necessary to define dominance inconsistencies with respect to a set of condition attributes containing at least one ordinal condition attribute. Furthermore, it is also assumed that we know if there exist increasing or decreasing monotonicity relationships between the values of ordinal condition and decision attributes. Very often, however, this information is unknown a priori. One solution to this issue is to transform the ordinal condition attributes with unknown directions of preference to pairs of attributes with supposed inverse monotonic relationships. Both local and global monotonicity relationships can be represented by decision rules induced from transformed decision tables. However, in some cases, transforming a decision table in this way is overcomplex. In this paper, we propose the inconsistency rates based on dominance and fuzzy preference relations that have the capacity of discovering monotonic relationships directly from data rather than induced decision rules. Moreover, we propose a refined transformation method by introducing an additional monotonicity checking using these inconsistency rates to determine whether an ordinal condition attribute should be cloned or not. Experiments are also provided to evaluate the usefulness of the refined transformation method.

AB  - The strategy of organizational lean production emphasizes on increasing efficiency, quality improvement and cycle time reduction by eliminating non-value added activities (MUDA). This paper presents a comprehensive approach based on data envelopment analysis (DEA), fuzzy DEA (FDEA), fuzzy cognitive map (FCM), Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for evaluating and optimizing the leanness degree of organizations to survive in competitively growing market. In this regard, a comprehensive list of quantitative and qualitative leanness measures is extracted from the literature. The efficiency of organizations is assessed and optimized by DEA. A heuristic algorithm is proposed to obtain a full ranking of leanness levels of organizations. Accordingly, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine impact of each leanness factor on lean strategy. The approach has been found fruitful while applying for a number of packing and printing organizations, in Iran, as a case study. Apart from evaluating overall lean performance metric, the proposed approach can evaluate the impact degree of leanness factors on each other as well as the impact of leanness factors on lean strategy. The result show that production procedure among the leanness measures has the most impact on leanness strategy in the organizations under study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that develops and implements an efficient decision-making procedural hierarchy to support leanness extent evaluation.

AB  - Heavy metals that are built-up on urban impervious surfaces such as roads are transported to urban water resources through stormwater runoff. Therefore, it is essential to understand the predominant pathways of heavy metals to the build-up on roads in order to develop suitable pollution mitigation strategies to protect the receiving water environment. The study presented in this paper investigated the sources and transport pathways of manganese, lead, copper, zinc and chromium, which are heavy metals commonly present in urban road build-up. It was found that manganese and lead are contributed to road build-up primarily by direct deposition due to the re-suspension of roadside soil by wind turbulence, while traffic is the predominant source of copper, zinc and chromium to the atmosphere and road build-up. Atmospheric deposition is also the major transport pathway for copper and zinc, and for chromium, direct deposition by traffic sources is the predominant pathway.

These emergency operations involve a variety of challenging optimization problems, for which evolutionary computation methods are well suited. In this paper we survey the research advances in evolutionary algorithms (EAs) applied to disaster relief operations. The operational problems are classified into five typical categories, and representative works on EAs for solving the problems are summarized, in order to give readers a general overview of the state-of-the-arts and facilitate them to find suitable methods in practical applications. Several state-of-art methods are compared on a set of real-world emergency transportation problem instances, and some lessons are drawn from the experimental analysis. Finally, the strengths, limitations and future directions in the area are discussed.

AB  - A selection hyper-heuristic is a high level search methodology which operates over a fixed set of low level heuristics. During the iterative search process, a heuristic is selected and applied to a candidate solution in hand, producing a new solution which is then accepted or rejected at each step. Selection hyper-heuristics have been increasingly, and successfully, applied to single-objective optimization problems, while work on multi-objective selection hyper-heuristics is limited. This work presents one of the initial studies on selection hyper-heuristics combining a choice function heuristic selection methodology with great deluge and late acceptance as non-deterministic move acceptance methods for multi-objective optimization. A well-known hypervolume metric is integrated into the move acceptance methods to enable the approaches to deal with multi-objective problems. The performance of the proposed hyper-heuristics is investigated on the Walking Fish Group test suite which is a common benchmark for multi-objective optimization. Additionally, they are applied to the vehicle crashworthiness design problem as a real-world multi-objective problem. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the non-deterministic move acceptance, particularly great deluge when used as a component of a choice function based selection hyper-heuristic.

AB  - Scarce healthcare resources require carefully made policies ensuring optimal bed allocation, quality healthcare service, and adequate financial support. This paper proposes a complex analysis of the resource allocation in a hospital department by integrating in the same framework a queuing system, a compartmental model, and an evolutionary-based optimization. The queuing system shapes the flow of patients through the hospital, the compartmental model offers a feasible structure of the hospital department in accordance to the queuing characteristics, and the evolutionary paradigm provides the means to optimize the bed-occupancy management and the resource utilization using a genetic algorithm approach. The paper also focuses on a “What-if analysis” providing a flexible tool to explore the effects on the outcomes of the queuing system and resource utilization through systematic changes in the input parameters. The methodology was illustrated using a simulation based on real data collected from a geriatric department of a hospital from London, UK. In addition, the paper explores the possibility of adapting the methodology to different medical departments (surgery, stroke, and mental illness). Moreover, the paper also focuses on the practical use of the model from the healthcare point of view, by presenting a simulated application.

A hybrid artificial immune network (Opt-aiNet) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) (aiNet-PSO) is then proposed to allocate the order quantity for the key suppliers at minimum cost. In order to verify the proposed method, a case company’s daily purchasing ledger is used, with emphasis on the consumer electronic product manufacturers. The computational results indicate that the TD-FP-growth algorithm can select the key suppliers using the historical data. The proposed hybrid method also provides a cheaper solution than a genetic algorithm, particle swam optimization, or an artificial immune system.

KW  - Real time rainfall prediction
KW  - Rainfall-runoff simulation
KW  - Runoff modeling uncertainty
AB  - Simulation of rainfall-runoff process in urban areas is of great importance considering the consequences and damages of extreme runoff events and floods. The first issue in flood hazard analysis is rainfall simulation. Large scale climate signals have been proved to be effective in rainfall simulation and prediction. In this study, an integrated scheme is developed for rainfall-runoff modeling considering different sources of uncertainty. This scheme includes three main steps of rainfall forecasting, rainfall-runoff simulation and future runoff prediction. In the first step, data driven models are developed and used to forecast rainfall using large scale climate signals as rainfall predictors. Due to high effect of different sources of uncertainty on the output of hydrologic models, in the second step uncertainty associated with input data, model parameters and model structure is incorporated in rainfall-runoff modeling and simulation. Three rainfall-runoff simulation models are developed for consideration of model conceptual (structural) uncertainty in real time runoff forecasting. To analyze the uncertainty of the model structure, streamflows generated by alternative rainfall-runoff models are combined, through developing a weighting method based on K-means clustering. Model parameters and input uncertainty are investigated using an adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Finally, calibrated rainfall-runoff models are driven using the forecasted rainfall to predict future runoff for the watershed. The proposed scheme is employed in the case study of the Bronx River watershed, New York City. Results of uncertainty analysis of rainfall-runoff modeling reveal that simultaneous estimation of model parameters and input uncertainty significantly changes the probability distribution of the model parameters. It is also observed that by combining the outputs of the hydrological models using the proposed clustering scheme, the accuracy of runoff simulation in the watershed is remarkably improved up to 50% in comparison to the simulations by the individual models. Results indicate that the developed methodology not only provides reliable tools for rainfall and runoff modeling, but also adequate time for incorporating required mitigation measures in dealing with potentially extreme runoff events and flood hazard. Results of this study can be used in identification of the main factors affecting flood hazard analysis.

AB  - Soil physical quality indicators (SPQIs) are used to make complex information more accessible to decision makers; however, their site-specific nature may restrict their applicability only to a specific soil type and/or management system. Therefore, it would be advantageous if such indicators could be predicted indirectly from easily available soil properties using inexpensive methods. In this study, we introduce a hybrid algorithm, specifically designed to work with optimized decision tree with particle swarm optimization (PSO-DT), for the prediction of SPQIs (i.e., air capacity, AC; plant-available water capacity, PAWC; and relative field capacity, RFC). The potential power of using the PSO-DT algorithm in setting up a framework for identifying the most determinant parameters affecting the physical quality of agricultural soils in a semiarid region of Iran (Baft plain, 29° 11′ to 29° 13′ N and 56° 34′ to 56° 38′ E) was also investigated. An empirical multiple linear regression (MLR) model was constructed as benchmark for the comparison of performance. In results, a permutation of five input features, including soil organic matter (SOM), electrical conductivity (EC), clay, sand, and bulk density (BD), was introduced by the hybrid PSO-DT algorithm as explanatory variables. Using the PSO-DT method resulted in higher model efficiency and coefficient of determination (R2) than the MLR approach. The obtained R2 values for the constructed PSO-DT model for the AC, PAWC, and RFC predictions were 0.91, 0.90, and 0.96, respectively, whereas they were 0.61, 0.16, and 0.47 for the MLR-model. The SOM, clay, and sand parameters were accounted as the discriminating variables of the models constructed for the prediction of AC, PAWC, and RFC indicators, respectively. This study provides a strong basis for the prediction of SPQIs and identifying the most determinant parameters influencing the physical quality of agricultural soils in semiarid regions of Iran; however, its general analytical framework could be applied to other parts of the world with similar challenges.

AB  - This study investigates the coupling effects of objective-reduction and preference-ordering schemes on the search efficiency in the evolutionary process of multi-objective optimization. The difficulty in solving a many-objective problem increases with the number of conflicting objectives. Degenerated objective space can enhance the multi-directional search toward the multi-dimensional Pareto-optimal front by eliminating redundant objectives, but it is difficult to capture the true Pareto-relation among objectives in the non-optimal solution domain. Successive linear objective-reduction for the dimensionality-reduction and dynamic goal programming for preference-ordering are developed individually and combined with a multi-objective genetic algorithm in order to reflect the aspiration levels for the essential objectives adaptively during optimization. The performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated in redundant and non-redundant benchmark test problems. The preference-ordering approach induces the non-dominated solutions near the front despite enduring a small loss in diversity of the solutions. The induced solutions facilitate a degeneration of the Pareto-optimal front using successive linear objective-reduction, which updates the set of essential objectives by excluding non-conflicting objectives from the set of total objectives based on a principal component analysis. Salient issues related to real-world problems are discussed based on the results of an oil-field application.

AB  - Recently, second-generation (non-vegetable oil) feedstocks for biodiesel production are receiving significant attention due to the cost and social effects connected with utilising food products for the production of energy products. The Beauty leaf tree (Calophyllum inophyllum) is a potential source of non-edible oil for producing second-generation biodiesel because of its suitability for production in an extensive variety of atmospheric condition, easy cultivation, high fruit production rate, and the high oil content in the seed. In this study, oil was extracted from Beauty leaf tree seeds through three different oil extraction methods. The important physical and chemical properties of these extracted Beauty leaf oils were experimentally analysed and compared with other commercially available vegetable oils. Biodiesel was produced using a two-stage esterification process combining of an acid catalysed pre-esterification process and an alkali catalysed transesterification process. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles and important physicochemical properties were experimentally measured and estimated using equations based on the FAME analysis. The quality of Beauty leaf biodiesels was assessed and compared with commercially available biodiesels through multivariate data analysis using PROMETHEE-GAIA software. The results show that mechanical extraction using a screw press produces oil at a low cost, however, results in low oil yields compared with chemical oil extraction. High pressure and temperature in the extraction process increase oil extraction performance. On the contrary, this process increases the free fatty acid content in the oil. A clear difference was found in the physical properties of Beauty leaf oils, which eventually affected the oil to biodiesel conversion process. However, Beauty leaf oils methyl esters (biodiesel) were very consistent physicochemical properties and able to meet almost all indicators of biodiesel standards. Overall this study found that Beauty leaf is a suitable feedstock for producing second-generation biodiesel in commercial scale. Therefore, the findings of this study are expected to serve as the basis for further development of Beauty leaf as a feedstock for industrial scale second-generation biodiesel production.

AB  - Engineering companies face the challenges of increasing product variety and technology induced increasing complexity of products. If the company is not able to manage this complexity within the design process it will cause productivity losses and rising complexity costs along the value-chain. Lack of information and information asymmetries lead to sub-optimal decision-making and thus to sub-optimal product-production-system designs. Companies struggle to evaluate product designs out of a broader, multi-functional perspective to derive the optimal design for the customer and company. The central question which needs to be solved is how companies can overcome these disadvantages in the early stages of product and process development. Based on the existing product design assessment methodologies proposed by academic and industrial communities this paper addresses these problems by developing a novel concept to improve decision-making performance in the early design phase by integrating the complexity perspective into decision-making. The paper delivers a guideline how to build up a complexity index to condense complex information.

AB  - The local set is the largest hypersphere centered on an instance such that it does not contain instances from any other class. Due to its geometrical nature, this structure can be very helpful for distance-based classification, such as classification based on the nearest neighbor rule. This paper is focused on instance selection for nearest neighbor classification which, in short, aims to reduce the number of instances in the training set without affecting the classification accuracy. Three instance selection methods based on local sets, which follow different and complementary strategies, are proposed. In an experimental study involving 26 known databases, they are compared with 11 of the most successful state-of-the-art methods in standard and noisy environments. To evaluate their performances, two complementary approaches are applied, the Pareto dominance relation and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. The results achieved by the proposals reveal that they are among the most effective methods in this field.

AB  - In multi-criteria group decision making, a key issue is aggregating individual preference into group one. In this study, we employ a bilateral agreement to conduct group evaluation of alternatives. The bilateral agreement between a pair of individuals could be on the weight of a criterion, a criterion evaluation function, or willingness to pay. Any one of three types of bilateral agreements can derive the group utility. To express the relationship between the bilateral agreement and individual evaluations, the quasi-arithmetic mean is used, which can ensure the consistency property of the pairwise comparison matrices. The minimum requirements are explored to obtain the group preference, which shows that n−1 pairs of bilateral agreements are necessary. Finally, several examples are provided to illustrate the proposed methods.

AB  - Vacuum/pressure swing adsorption is an attractive and often energy efficient separation process for some applications. However, there is often a trade-off between the different objectives: purity, recovery and power consumption. Identifying those trade-offs is possible through use of multi-objective optimisation methods but this is computationally challenging due to the size of the search space and the need for high fidelity simulations due to the inherently dynamic nature of the process. This paper presents the use of surrogate modelling to address the computational requirements of high fidelity simulations needed to evaluate alternative designs. We present SbNSGA-II ALM, surrogate based NSGA-II, a robust and fast multi-objective optimisation method based on kriging surrogate models and NSGA-II with the Active Learning MacKay (ALM) design criterion. The method is evaluated by application to an industrially relevant case study: a two column six step system for CO2/N2 separation. A 5 times reduction in computational effort is observed.

Patent power and expansion potential are considered as technology scope indicators. A data fusion algorithm is applied to combine the results obtained from different criteria. The usefulness and potential of the proposed forecasting approach has been demonstrated using all U.S. patents related to three technologies, namely thin film transistor-liquid crystal display, flash memory system, and personal digital assistant. The results obtained from these patents demonstrate that the personal digital assistant technology is preferred over other technologies. Investments in thin film transistor liquid-crystal display and flash memory system technologies have equal priority.

Our proposal is based on the neutrality in between the opposite poles, such that a basic type of structure is used to characterize in logical terms the concepts and the knowledge that they generate. In this paper we model the meaning of concepts by paired structures, and apply these structures for learning and building the different meanings of preference for decision making.

AB  - Process optimization for two or more objectives is increasing. Since objectives are often conflicting, multi-objective optimization (MOO) provides many Pareto-optimal solutions, quantitative trade-off between objectives, optimal values of decision variables and their trends. These results give greater insight about the process and are useful for selecting one of the optimal solutions. In this paper, MOO is introduced and compared with single objective optimization, and then MOO studies on design of energy efficient processes, published from January 2013 to February 2015, are reviewed. MOO applications in 65 papers of interest to chemical engineers, are classified into four groups: energy efficient processes, biofuels, power generation/CO2 capture, and fuel cell/hydrogen production. Main features of these studies are summarized in four tables. Finally, concluding remarks are given for future studies on MOO applications.

In recent years, several fuzzy FMCDM tools have been suggested to choosing the optimal probably options. The purpose of this paper is to review systematically the applications and methodologies of the fuzzy multi decision-making (FMCDM) techniques. This study reviewed a total of 403 papers published from 1994 to 2014 in more than 150 peer reviewed journals (extracted from online databases such as ScienceDirect, Springer, Emerald, Wiley, ProQuest, and Taylor & Francis). According to experts’ opinions, these papers were grouped into four main fields: engineering, management and business, science, and technology. Furthermore, these papers were categorized based on authors, publication date, country of origin, methods, tools, and type of research (FMCDM utilizing research, FMCDM developing research, and FMCDM proposing research). The results of this study indicated that, in 2013, scholars have published papers more than other years. In addition, hybrid fuzzy MCDM in the integrated method and fuzzy AHP in the individual section were ranked as the first and second methods in use. Additionally, Taiwan was ranked as the first country that contributed to this survey, and engineering was ranked as the first field that has applied fuzzy DM tools and techniques.

AB  - Dominance-based Rough Sets Approach (DRSA) has received much attention since it is able to acquire knowledge from information with preference ordered attribute domains and decision classes. In many real-life applications, the information systems may evolve over time dynamically. In a dynamic information system, the obtained knowledge, e.g., approximations in DRSA, need to be updated for decision making and other related tasks. As a useful technique, the incremental update can be applied to process dynamic information with revising the obtained knowledge. In this paper, we propose an incremental approach for maintaining approximations of DRSA when attribute values vary over time. Some numerical examples illustrate that the incremental approach can renew approximations of DRSA without beginning from scratch. Experimental evaluations show that the incremental algorithm can effectively reduce the computational time in comparison with the non-incremental one when the ratio of the attribute values varied is less than a threshold.

AB  - Recently, the Internet has made a lot of services and products appear online provided by many tourism sectors. By this way, many information such as timetables, routes, accommodations, and restaurants are easily available to help travelers plan their travels. However, how to plan the most appropriate travel schedule under simultaneously considering several factors such as tourist attractions visiting, local hotels selecting, and travel budget calculation is a challenge. This gives rise to our interest in exploring the recommendation systems with relation to schedule recommendation. Additionally, the personalized concept is not implemented completely in most of travel recommendation systems. One notable problem is that they simply recommended the most popular travel routes or projects, and cannot plan the travel schedule. Moreover, the existing travel planning systems have limits in their capabilities to adapt to the changes based on users’ requirements and planning results. To tackle these problems, we develop a personalized travel planning system that simultaneously considers all categories of user requirements and provides users with a travel schedule planning service that approximates automation. A novel travel schedule planning algorithm is embedded to plan travel schedules based on users’ need. Through the user-adapted interface and adjustable results design, users can replace any unsatisfied travel unit to specific one. The feedback mechanism provides a better accuracy rate for next travel schedule to new users. An experiment was conducted to examine the satisfaction and use intention of the system. The results showed that participants who used the system with schedule planning have statistical significant on user satisfaction and use intention. We also analyzed the validity of applying the proposed algorithm to a user preference travel schedule through a number of practical system tests. In addition, comparing with other travel recommendation systems, our system had better performance on the schedule adjustment, personalization, and feedback giving.

AB  - Environmental decision support intends to use the best available scientific knowledge to help decision makers find and evaluate management alternatives. The goal of this process is to achieve the best fulfillment of societal objectives. This requires a careful analysis of (i) how scientific knowledge can be represented and quantified, (ii) how societal preferences can be described and elicited, and (iii) how these concepts can best be used to support communication with authorities, politicians, and the public in environmental management. The goal of this paper is to discuss key requirements for a conceptual framework to address these issues and to suggest how these can best be met. We argue that a combination of probability theory and scenario planning with multi-attribute utility theory fulfills these requirements, and discuss adaptations and extensions of these theories to improve their application for supporting environmental decision making. With respect to (i) we suggest the use of intersubjective probabilities, if required extended to imprecise probabilities, to describe the current state of scientific knowledge. To address (ii), we emphasize the importance of value functions, in addition to utilities, to support decisions under risk. We discuss the need for testing “non-standard” value aggregation techniques, the usefulness of flexibility of value functions regarding attribute data availability, the elicitation of value functions for sub-objectives from experts, and the consideration of uncertainty in value and utility elicitation. With respect to (iii), we outline a well-structured procedure for transparent environmental decision support that is based on a clear separation of scientific prediction and societal valuation. We illustrate aspects of the suggested methodology by its application to river management in general and with a small, didactical case study on spatial river rehabilitation prioritization.

AB  - A quantitative method is presented to rank strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as a platform for pre-pandemic and pandemic influenza vaccines. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to achieve pairwise comparisons among SWOT factors in order to prioritize them. Key opinion leaders (KOLs) in the influenza vaccine field were interviewed to collect a unique dataset to evaluate the market potential of this platform. The purpose of this study, to evaluate commercial potential of the MVA platform for the development of novel generation pandemic influenza vaccines, is accomplished by using a SWOT and AHP combined analytic method. Application of the SWOT–AHP model indicates that its strengths are considered more important by KOLs than its weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Particularly, the inherent immunogenicity capability of MVA without the requirement of an adjuvant is the most important factor to increase commercial attractiveness of this platform. Concerns regarding vector vaccines and anti-vector immunity are considered its most important weakness, which might lower public health value of this platform. Furthermore, evaluation of the results of this study emphasizes equally important role that threats and opportunities of this platform play. This study further highlights unmet needs in the influenza vaccine market, which could be addressed by the implementation of the MVA platform. Broad use of MVA in clinical trials shows great promise for this vector as vaccine platform for pre-pandemic and pandemic influenza and threats by other respiratory viruses. Moreover, from the results of the clinical trials seem that MVA is particularly attractive for development of vaccines against pathogens for which no, or only insufficiently effective vaccines, are available.

AB  - Design concept evaluation at the early stage of product design has been widely recognized as one of the most critical phases in new product development as it determines the direction of the downstream design activities. However, the information at this stage is mainly subjective and imprecise which only depends on experts’ judgments. How to handle the vagueness and subjectivity in design concept evaluation becomes a critical issue. This paper presents a systematic evaluation method by integrating rough number based analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and rough number based compromise ranking method (also known as VIKOR) to evaluate design concepts under subjective environment. In this study, rough number is introduced to aggregate individual judgments and preferences and deal with the vagueness in decision-making. A novel AHP based on rough number is presented to determine the weight of each evaluation criterion. Then an improved rough number based VIKOR is proposed to evaluate the design concept alternatives. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to measure the impact of the decision makers’ risk to the final evaluation results. Finally, a practical example is put forward to validate the performance of the proposed method. The result shows that the proposed decision-making method can effectively enhance the objectivity in design concept evaluation under subjective environment.

AB  - Customer orders with high product varieties in small quantities are often received by the logistics service providers with requests for customized value-added services and timely delivery, so the warehouse has to plan its logistics strategy in such a way that it can effectively maintain the quality of its services. In addition, they have to pay attention to the possible risks that may occur during the logistics operations so as to prevent loss if they fail to deal with the problems and risks properly. In order to facilitate the decision making process in warehouse operations, an intelligent system, namely the knowledge-based logistics operations planning system (K-LOPS), is proposed to formulate a useful action plan by considering the potential risks faced by the logistics service providers. The system makes use of Radio Frequency Identification technology to collect real-time logistics data. Analytical hierarchy processes and case-based reasoning are integrated into the system. These help to categorize the potential risk factors considered by customers and formulate the logistics operations strategy, respectively, as the different product characteristics and order demands are taken into consideration. The searching performance in case-based reasoning is enhanced by the iterative dynamic partitional clustering algorithm. After conducting a trial run in the case company, the result shows that there is significant improvement in case retrieval time and in solution formulation.

AB  - This research work deals with the multi-product multi-period inventory lot sizing with supplier selection problem. Formerly, this kind of problem was formulated and solved using an exhaustive enumeration algorithm and a heuristic algorithm. In this paper, a new algorithm based on a reduce and optimize approach and a new valid inequality is proposed to solve the multi-product multi-period inventory lot sizing with supplier selection problem. Numerical experiments ratify the success of the proposed heuristic algorithm. For the set of 150 benchmark instances, including 75 small-sized instances, 30 medium-sized instances, and 45 large-sized instances, the algorithm always obtained better solutions compared with those previously published. Furthermore, according to the computational results, the developed heuristic algorithm outperforms the CPLEX MIP solver in both solution quality and computational time.

AB  - Precision marketing offers personalized customer service and is used to help enterprises increase their profits by means of high-efficiency marketing. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework for precision marking using data-mining techniques. First, this study presents a trend model to accurately predict monthly supply quantity; second, it uses a RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) model to select attributes to cluster customers into different groups; third, it uses CHAID decision trees and Pareto values to identify important attribute values to distinguish different customer groups; and finally, it creates different supply strategies targeting each customer group. The objective of the proposed precision-making framework is to help managers identify the potential characteristics of different customer categories and put forward appropriate precision marketing strategies, which can greatly reduce inventory for every customer category. The real-world data from a company in China were collected and used in a case study to illustrate how to implement the proposed framework. This case study demonstrates that our proposed decision-making framework is efficient and capable of providing a very good precision marketing strategy for enterprises.

AB  - In the last few decades, environmental concerns of manufacturing operations have motivated the organisations to implement green principles in different processes of the supply chain. In this paper, literature in green processes is critically reviewed to understand the process-specific green issues of the supply chain. A 10-year period (2005-2014) is considered in this paper to select and analyse relevant studies. Using related keywords, we found 299 papers, out of which 66 are discussed in this review paper. We have excluded papers pertaining to areas such as paper industry, textile industry, and municipal waste management. Moreover, the paper focuses on studies conducted to improve the greenness of different supply chain processes and to identify the barriers in adopting these green practices.

AB  - The study demonstrates how to extract essential information from a set of financial and non-financial business indicators, leading to a better understanding of company performance. To this end, use Rough Set Theory and the Dominance principle are used. The usage is justified by the possibility of there being uncertain data - uncertainty that needs to be treated analytically to yield an essential set of effectively consistent information. The analysis was based on the Brazilian publication Exame Melhores e Maiores 2013, which lists the 500 largest companies in various economic sectors ordered by net sales. The methods employed here can be extended to take other financial and non-financial indicators into account to infer patterns often hidden in the data. Furthermore, this study revealed the importance of broadening the analysis of enterprise indicators when the goal is, for example, to produce a more critical view for investment decisions and to measure the performance of probable competitors.

AB  - Reliable estimates of construction costs and schedules presented by contemporary construction companies, their consultants and suppliers at the time of project approval are important for justifying a project on economic ground and for planning the means of financing it. The economic impact of a construction cost overrun is the possible loss of the economic justification for the project. A cost overrun can also be critical for creating policies within sustainable development on the basis of economic costs. The financial impact of a cost overrun results also in demand for construction investments credits. The paper presents a case of construction cost analysis for wooden energy efficient house that meets sustainable aspects. Analyzed object is characterized by high costs of the construction investment, that result from specific characteristics of the construction output (energy efficient wooden house). In the result of analysis of the construction investment costs for the efficient wooden house and its comparison with the costs of traditional construction investment on maintenance costs, it can be stated that additional cost resulting from the energy efficient house building is higher than costs of traditional construction investment (about 10%) and it can be treated as the investment in the energy efficient house solutions since it brings savings for home expenditures (5% annually).

AB  - To survive in a rapidly changing environment, theme parks need to provide high quality services in terms of visitor tastes and preferences. Understanding the spatial and temporal behavior of visitors could enhance the attraction management and geographical distribution for visitors. To fulfill the need, this research defined a Location-Item-Time (LIT) sequence to describe visitor’s spatial and temporal behavior. Then, the Location-Item-Time PrefixSpan (LIT-PrefixSpan) mining algorithm is developed to discover frequent LIT sequential patterns. Next, the route suggestion procedure is proposed to retrieve suitable LIT sequential patterns for visitors under the constraints of their intended-visiting time, favorite regions, and favorite recreation facilities. A simplified theme park is used as an example to show the feasibility of the proposed system. The experimental results show that the system can help managers understand visitors’ behavior and provide appropriate visiting experiences for visitors.

Therefore, this research attempted to provide an integrated step by step procedure to consider both classical and green key performance indicators within the supplier selection framework. A literature survey was conducted and measures for assessing the green suppliers were extracted. Nominal Group Technique (NGT) is deployed to extract the most critical performance measures. Ten performance measures were selected as a substitute for green supplier selection. A Fuzzy Analytical Network Process (FANP) was then deployed to weight the extracted measures and determine their importance level.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology for comparing the performance of model-reduction strategies to be used with a diagnostic methodology for leak detection in water distribution networks. The goal is to find reduction strategies that are suitable for error-domain model falsification, a model based data interpretation methodology. Twelve reduction strategies are derived from five strategy categories. Categories differ according to the manner in which nodes are selected for deletion. A node is selected for deletion according to: (1) the diameter of the pipes; (2) the number of pipes linked to a node; (3) the angle of the pipes in the case of two-pipe nodes; (4) the distribution of the water demand; and, (5) a pair-wise combination of some categories. The methodology is illustrated using part of a real network. Performance is evaluated first by judging the equivalency of the reduced network with the initial network (before the application of any reduction procedure) and secondly, by assessing the compatibility with the diagnostic methodology. The results show that for each reduction strategy the equivalency of networks is verified. Computational time can be reduced to less than 20% of the non-reduced network in the best case. Results of diagnostic performance show that the performance decreases when using reduced networks. The reduction strategy with the best diagnostic performance is that based on the angle of two-pipe nodes, with an angle threshold of 165°. In addition, the sensitivity of the performance of the reduced networks to variation in leak intensity is evaluated. Results show that the reduction strategies where the number of nodes is significantly reduced are the most sensitive. Finally this paper describes a Pareto analysis that is used to select the reduction strategy that is a good compromise between reduction of computational time and performance of the diagnosis. In this context, the extension strategy is the most attractive.

AB  - Green purchasing plays an increasingly significant role in today’s supply chain management. Recycling, as a key factor in sustainable development, is seriously considered by many manufacturers during the process of procurement. In order to establish long-term green purchasing relationships between multi-stakeholders (suppliers and manufacturers), in this study the supplier selection concept model suggested by de Boer is updated, and an evolutionary game model is developed to observe the cooperation tendency of multi-stakeholders. The newly proposed game model intensively studies the trade behavior which can be realized as strategies and payoff functions of the suppliers and manufacturers. In addition, a replicator dynamic system is formulated to study evolutionarily stable strategies of multi-stakeholders. To verify the theoretical results, simulation experiments are conducted with meaningful results: the manufacturing industry can form the patterns of sustainable development, and the recycling capability of suppliers directly determines how green a supply chain is. The results can guide stakeholders to make better decisions in the future.

AB  - Monitoring and analysis of daily gas concentrations at a mining face is a vital task on safety production and security management in the coal-mining industry. This study addresses modeling and prediction of daily gas concentration variations based on the elliptic orbit model. The model describes the hourly variation in daily gas concentration by mapping its time-series into the polar coordinates to create its elliptic orbit trace for further analysis. Experiments show workability of the proposed method that daily gas concentration variation at a mining face of one coal mine in China is well described by the elliptic orbit model. Result analysis and performance comparison of the proposed elliptic orbit model with the classical AR model on the same prediction tasks indicate potentiality of the proposed elliptic orbit model, which presents a vivid approach for modeling and forecasting daily gas concentration variations in an intuitive and concise way.

AB  - In the current work, a solution methodology which combines a meta-heuristic algorithm with an exact solution approach is presented to solve cardinality constrained portfolio optimization (CCPO) problem. The proposed method is comprised of two levels, namely, stock selection and proportion determination. In stock selection level, a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) is developed. Once the stocks are selected the problem reduces to a quadratic programming problem. As GRASP ensures cardinality constraints by selecting predetermined number of stocks and quadratic programming model ensures the remaining problem constraints, no further constraint handling procedures are required. On the other hand, as the problem is decomposed into two sub-problems, total computational burden on the algorithm is considerably reduced. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by using benchmark data sets available in the OR Library. Computational results reveal that the proposed algorithm is competitive with the state of the art algorithms in the related literature.

AB  - Nowadays, manufacturing companies have been working based on people-oriented approach. Customer satisfaction is currently not only for external customers but also required for internal customers. In this context, human resource is one of the most important resources to manage and vital for manufacturing companies in terms of customers, employees and managers. With this perception, The Human Resource Management (HRM) issue is emerged. HRM enables effective and efficient management of human resources. Manufacturing companies considers that the existing abilities and qualification of its employees is insufficient for achieving their targets. The gap between desired level of capabilities and the existing capabilities of the human recourses should be narrowed. Therefore talent management (TM) concept is introduced in order to deal with the gap and reveal the required personnel profile. TM raises institutional awareness and is a supportive tool for HRM. The TM contributes to remove wastes of the companies and supports self-improvement of its employees. In other words the TM is a key of success about exploring abilities. The aim of this study is to propose a model for investigating competency level of employees and utilizing this information in obtaining a yield in an optimal level from employees’ emotional and intellectual capabilities, and experiences. The level of perception and job-ability match of each employee is different. The tests implemented in companies for TM purposes are usually evaluated in crisp logic like black and white. In this study, a fuzzy logic approach is proposed in order to deal with uncertainty and vagueness in assessment of TM.

AB  - Mobile applications equipped with Global Positioning Systems have generated a huge quantity of location data with sampling uncertainty that needs to be handled and analyzed. Those location data can be ordered in time to represent trajectories of moving objects. The data warehouse approach based on spatio-temporal data can help on the analysis. For this reason, we consider the problem of personalized reconstruction of low-sampling trajectories and include the criteria of movement as a dimension of analysis in a trajectory data warehouse. We enhance the analytics using dimensional modelling and graphical analysis in order to provide mechanisms to help decision makers. For example, analysts may formulate queries such as What are the top 5 most traversed streets between 07:00:00 am and 09:00:00 pm on August 9, 2014 (Saturday) if the trajectories are reconstructed using the touristic criterion? The answer to this query may help users to identify, e.g., city bottlenecks.

AB  - Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a well-known non-parametric methodology for measuring the relative efficiency of decision making units (DMUs). One of the points that must be considered in the usage of DEA is relationship between the number of DMUs and the number of inputs/outputs. Managers wish to apply a large set of inputs/outputs as well as classify them in order to calculate a relative technical efficiency. But, the limitations of the conventional models do not allow that have been used a large set of inputs and outputs. On the other hand, removing a specific input (or output) can greatly change the evaluation results. This paper introduces a multi-objective DEA (MODEA) model to remove the limitations of the conventional DEA models. In MODEA model, multiple objectives generate multiple frontiers. Despite other multi-objective problems, the existing methods and procedures for obtaining Pareto solutions may not be useful in MODEA because, we do not need Pareto solutions. Therefore, appropriate and fair weights regarding to the importance of each objective should be found to obtain unique efficiency score. For this purpose, the Shapley value as cooperative game has been applied. The results of the proposed approach are closer to reality. The approach regardless of the number of DMUs discriminates among the DMUs more effectively. In addition, DMUs are compared by multi-category of measures in the competitive environment. Furthermore, the abilities of the approach are demonstrated by a case study of the Iranian power plants. Also, the case study shows the steps of solving MODEA model.

Six geometric input variables were included in the optimization procedure (welding chamber and bridges height, ports width, undercut on ports, die entry angle, mandrel-bridges fillet radius) together with the ram speed. The multi-objective optimization was performed by means of modeFRONTIER® using meta-models generated over a selected set of experimental and numerical training designs.

AB  - This study surveys the increasing research field of performance measurement by making use of a bibliometric literature analysis. We concentrate on two approaches, namely Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) as the most important methods to evaluate the efficiency of individual and organizational performance. It is the first literature survey that analyses DEA and SFA publications jointly, covering contributions published in journals, indexed by the Web of Science database from 1978 to 2012. Our aim is to identify seminal papers, playing a major role in DEA and SFA development and to determine areas of adoption. We recognized a constant growth of publications during the years identifying DEA as a standard technique in Operations Research, whereas SFA is mainly adopted in Economic research fields. Making use of document co-citation analysis we identify Airports and Supplier Selection (DEA) as well as Banking and Agriculture (SFA) as most influential application areas. Furthermore, Sensitivity and Fuzzy Set Theory (DEA) as well as Bayesian Analysis and Heterogeneity (SFA) are found to be most influential research areas and seem to be methodological trends. By developing an adoption rate of knowledge we identify that research, in terms of citations, is more focusing on relatively old and recent research at the expenses of middle-aged contributions, which is a typical phenomenon of a fast developing discipline.

AB  - Holistic management of water and energy resources is critical for water utilities facing increasing energy prices, water supply shortage and stringent regulatory requirements. In the early 1990s, the concept of an integrated Energy and Water Quality Management System (EWQMS) was developed as an operational optimization framework for solving water quality, water supply and energy management problems simultaneously. Approximately twenty water utilities have implemented an EWQMS by interfacing commercial or in–house software optimization programs with existing control systems. For utilities with an installed EWQMS, operating cost savings of 8–15% have been reported due to higher use of cheaper tariff periods and better operating efficiencies, resulting in the reduction in energy consumption of ∼6–9%. This review provides the current state-of-knowledge on EWQMS typical structural features and operational strategies and benefits and drawbacks are analyzed. The review also highlights the challenges encountered during installation and implementation of EWQMS and identifies the knowledge gaps that should motivate new research efforts.

AB  - Cloud computing is increasing in usage because of its technical and financial advantages over traditional computing paradigms and also because of the availability of an expanding number of cloud services offered by new service providers. Consistent with its growth, there has been wide research interest in the literature that focuses on increasing cloud adoption. However, the current commercial and research-oriented cloud computing research in the literature mainly deals with functionalities closer to cloud infrastructure, such as improved performance and the management of virtualized resources, as well as fundamental issues related to efficient resource utilization, such as virtual machine (VM) migrations and server consolidation. While on the one hand, such features are very important, on the other hand, other important features, such as cloud quality of service management which is important for the cloud environment to move from a basic cloud service infrastructure to a broader cloud service ecosystem, have not received the required due attention. In cloud service management, a cloud service user has several choices for service selection and the quest to achieve interoperability and compatibility in cloud computing will consequently enable the user to easily migrate between service providers. In this scenario, the user needs to make important cloud service management decisions based on QoS, in addition to other criteria such as usage cost. These issues, when considered from a user׳s perspective, are quite different from cloud infrastructure management issues envisioned from a cloud provider׳s perspective. There are several challenges in cloud service management from a user׳s perspective, which the current cloud service management platforms in the literature do not address. To address this drawback, this paper presents a comprehensive state-of-the-art discussion on the existing approaches to cloud service management, critically evaluates them against the factors required for the user to manage the cloud service and presents a framework that assists the cloud service user in making cloud service management decisions.

KW  - Decision-making model
AB  - Due to the increasing global environmental consciousness and sustainability concerns, different industries that deal with Reverse Logistics (RL) are seeking methods to measure and analyze the impacts of their RL activities on the environment. However, making the greenest decision in the vague and complex area of RL makes this process somewhat difficult. Hence, to address these issues and provide a more meticulous and closer approach to the real world situations, a FUZZY-VIKOR method using interval-valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is proposed in the current research. As the further discussions explain, first, the significant factors in environmental sound practices together with the main processes and recovery options in RL are identified. Second, the influences of each green environmental factor on each RL recovery option are analyzed and ranked. To obtain concise results, the elicitation of experts is sought from among academicians and industry. The final results illustrate that, intriguingly, disposing of the returns has the lowest negative impact on the environment; thereby the best recovery option, while reselling of the returns was perceived as the worst recovery option. This research also suggests new directions for future research. From the managerial point of view, it would be interesting to study a sustainable reverse logistics through the proposed model. We only considered the impacts of environmental factors on RL, while the final decision will be more exact if the economic and societal aspects of RL are also analyzed. In addition, to reflect the technical views of all the stakeholders in RL towards the best recovery option and also take into account their concerns, we suggest designing a group decision making model across the RL using the Fuzzy-MADM methods.

AB  - Rough set theory is advocated as a framework for conceptualizing and analyzing various types of data, which is a powerful tool for discovering patterns in a given data set through a pair of concepts, namely, upper and lower approximations. Strategic behaviors need to be reinforced continuously under the dynamic decision environment where data in the decision process can change over time. Incremental learning is an effective technique to deal with dynamic learning tasks since it can make full use of previous knowledge. Set-valued data, in which a set of values are associated with an individual, is common in real-world data sets. Motivated by the needs of knowledge updating due to the dynamic variation of criteria values in the set-valued decision system, in this paper, we present the updating properties for dynamic maintenance of approximations when the criteria values in the set-valued decision system evolve with time. Then, two incremental algorithms for computing rough approximations are proposed corresponding to the addition and removal of criteria values, respectively. Experimental results show our incremental algorithms work successfully on datasets from UCI as well as artificial datasets, and achieve better performance than the traditional non-incremental method.

AB  - Conventional materials selection system was replaced with sophisticated software tools by rapid changing technology. The growing environmental concerns and regulations widely among the industry, especially in automobiles, force us to explore the natural fiber materials as a replacement for synthetic materials which is in common use. As a result of extensive research and development, new natural fiber reinforced composite materials are emerging and the database of materials growing exponentially. The decision of selecting optimized materials was complicated, as it involves diversified choice of materials, coupled with various influencing criteria for the selection process. To abstain from deciding inappropriate materials, the technology of expert system software tools can help us in the appropriate materials selection. The objective of this research was to explore the implementation of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) using the expert choice software tool for deciding optimum natural fiber reinforced composite materials by considering main criteria and sub-criteria in the hierarchical model. The final judgement was performed with different scenarios of sensitivity analysis, giving priority to the environmental factors and sustainability. The result shows that the natural fiber composite material hemp and polypropylene gained the higher rank in the selection process and almost compliant with the requirements of industrial product design specification and can be recommended to automotive component manufacturers to enforce green technology.

AB  - This paper introduces an approach to cancer classification through gene expression profiles by designing supervised learning hidden Markov models (HMMs). Gene expression of each tumor type is modelled by an HMM, which maximizes the likelihood of the data. Prominent discriminant genes are selected by a novel method based on a modification of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Unlike conventional AHP, the modified AHP allows to process quantitative factors that are ranking outcomes of individual gene selection methods including t-test, entropy, receiver operating characteristic curve, Wilcoxon test and signal to noise ratio. The modified AHP aggregates ranking results of individual gene selection methods to form stable and robust gene subsets. Experimental results demonstrate the performance dominance of the HMM approach against six comparable classifiers. Results also show that gene subsets generated by modified AHP lead to greater accuracy and stability compared to competing gene selection methods, i.e. information gain, symmetrical uncertainty, Bhattacharyya distance, and ReliefF. The modified AHP improves the classification performance not only of the HMM but also of all other classifiers. Accordingly, the proposed combination between the modified AHP and HMM is a powerful tool for cancer classification and useful as a real clinical decision support system for medical practitioners.

AB  - Global climate change and rising sea levels are impacting the sustainability and vitality of coastal communities, making identifying vulnerable areas particularly important to minimize the population and infrastructure at risk. In this paper, we expand the classic overlay method developed by Ian McHarg by incorporating sea level rise projections for the 2020s and 2050s into a GIS-based land use suitability analysis of New York City. This analysis considers elevation, slope, distance to coast, rock type, land cover, and sea level rise, which was modeled using a bathtub model. We use the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to produce weights for the criteria considered. Our results suggest that Eastern Staten Island and the southern shore of Brooklyn and Queens are especially unsuitable for future development without major adaptation measures. We also offer recommendations for improving this analysis through improved hydrological connectivity measures in modeling sea level rise, as well as better methods of accounting for policies influencing the manner of development in flood zones.

Hence, a comprehensive literature review of recent and state-of-the-art papers is vital to draw a framework of the past, and to shed light on future directions. The aim of this paper is to review recently published papers in reverse logistic and closed-loop supply chain in scientific journals. A total of 382 papers published between January 2007 and March 2013 are selected and reviewed. The papers are then analyzed and categorized to construct a useful foundation of past research. Finally, gaps in the literature are identified to clarify and to suggest future research opportunities.

AB  - The paper presents a novel cross-efficiency fuzzy Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique for evaluating different elements (Decision Making Units or DMUs) under uncertainty. In order to evaluate the performance of several DMUs while dealing with uncertain input and output data, the presented technique employs triangular fuzzy numbers. A fuzzy triangular efficiency is associated to each DMU through a cross evaluation obtained by a compromise between suitably chosen objectives. Results are then defuzzified to provide a ranking of the DMUs. The proposed method is applied to the performance evaluation of healthcare systems in a region of Southern Italy. The DMU data uncertainty derives from ongoing reforms and the reported assessment is conducted firstly in order to evaluate and rank the efficiency of the considered healthcare systems, and subsequently to assess the evolution of the performance of one of the most affected among these DMUs by the reform plans. The case study demonstrates the model ease of application, its discriminative power among DMUs when compared to a more classical fuzzy DEA approach, and the usefulness in planning and validating targeted reforms in the case of healthcare systems.

Both classifiers are verified by accuracy measurements. The results show that GrC had a better performance for seismic vulnerability assessment. In addition, the city of Tehran is judged to have a severe situation against possible earthquakes.

The underlying optimization algorithms, process simulation models, and interfaces allow users to not only spatially optimize the locations and types of new conservation practices based on quantifiable goals estimated by the dynamic simulation models, but also to include their personal subjective and/or unquantifiable criteria in the location and design of these practices.

KW  - Transportation systems analysis
KW  - Wicked problems
AB  - Transportation systems are complex sociotechnical systems and this dual nature is reflected in the literature dealing with their planning, i.e. defining courses of action from both public and private points of view. On the one hand, the social sciences literature makes it clear that most decisions related to transportation are “wicked”, i.e. they cannot be tackled with traditional engineering approaches since they are poorly defined. On the other, transportation systems have a strong technical component affecting most of such decisions, as they have to (or should) comply with compelling technical and economic requirements. The literature on transport engineering and economics deals with transportation planning mostly as a rational process based on the formulation and comparison of alternative options. In this paper, we propose an approach to planning and designing transportation systems, at least in the more complex cases, meant to bridge the gap between social and technical points of view. The proposed approach is cross-disciplinary, as it integrates notions from cognitive sciences, organization and management sciences with transportation systems analysis. Transportation planning, both under public and private market-oriented viewpoints, is seen as a complex decision-making process where different actors (decision-makers, stakeholders, professionals) interact in different contexts and according to different “models” or approaches. After a brief discussion of the main elements of most planning processes and of the different decision making models, the paper proposes a decision-making model based on three parallel and intertwined processes: a cognitive rational approach to organizing the decision-making process, a five-level stakeholder engagement process, and a revised role of quantitative analyses and methods drawing on tools from engineering and economics, amongst other disciplines. We also present a real application of the proposed decision-making model to the case study of the Regional Metro System (RMS) project in Campania (southern Italy), where a complex decisional context with different stakeholders and multiple (often contrasting) interests was managed in the integrated framework for over a decade, resulting in the largest and most effective of such projects in Italy. Finally, the paper proposes new roles and new challenges for quantitative analyses and mathematical tools to support participated decision-making processes, extending their well-established functions for designing and assessing transportation solutions.

A full-scale and well-calibrated hydraulic model of the whole water supply system is built using an extended version of EPANET, allowing storing and restoring the state of plug flow in links. Once an hour, the simulator is updated with the previous hour's hydraulic and quality state from the utility's supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and a simulation is performed. The results are stored both in GeoJSON format for geographic information systems (GIS) and in a relational database for later use. Some results are presented to the general public in a geographically aggregated form over a web user interface and as open data using Representational State Transfer (REST) web service interface.

AB  - Tower crane layout design and planning within construction site is a common construction technical issue, and is regarded as a complex combinatorial problem. Previous research focused on utilising either mathematical methods or visualisation tools to find an optimal tower crane layout plan. Both these two approaches require large amounts of manual data input by the layout planners, which is time-consuming and not very practical in industry. The purpose of this paper is to develop an integrated approach which combines Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Firefly Algorithm (FA) to automatically generate an optimal tower crane layout plan. Firstly, BIM is utilised to provide inputs for the mathematical model. Then the FA is used to determine the optimal locations of tower cranes and supply points. Finally, the optimal tower crane layout scheme will be visualised and evaluated through BIM-based simulation. A practical case is selected to demonstrate the proposed approach. The final result is promising and demonstrates the practical value of this approach.

We start by briefly discussing the MANET paradigm, and why the research on MANET protocols is now a cold research topic. Then we analyze the active research areas. Specifically, after discussing the wireless-network technologies, we analyze four successful ad hoc networking paradigms, mesh networks, opportunistic networks, vehicular networks, and sensor networks that emerged from the MANET world. We also present an emerging research direction in the multi-hop ad hoc networking field: people centric networking, triggered by the increasing penetration of the smartphones in everyday life, which is generating a people-centric revolution in computing and communications.

AB  - The GSD team-level service climate is one of the key determinants to achieve the outcome of global software development (GSD) projects from the software service outsourcing perspective. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the GSD team-level service climate and GSD project outcome relationship based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with the genetic learning algorithm. For measuring the team-level service climate, the Hybrid Taguchi-Genetic Learning Algorithm (HTGLA) is adopted in the ANFIS, which is more appropriate to determine the optimal premise and consequent constructs by reducing the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of service climate criteria. For measuring the GSD team-level service climate, synthesizing the literature reviews and consistent with the earlier studies on IT service climate which is classified into three main criterion: managerial practices (deliver quality of service), global service climate (measure overall perceptions), service leadership (goal setting, work planning, and coordination) which comprises 25 GSD team-level service climate attributes. The experimental results show that the optimal prediction error is obtained by the HTGLA-based ANFIS approach is 3.26%, which outperforms the earlier result that is the optimal prediction errors 4.41% and 5.75% determined, respectively, by ANFIS and statistical methods.

AB  - The world is witnessing a change-over from its present centralized generation to a future with greater share of distributed generation. Hybrid energy systems are inter-connected with wind power, photovoltaic power, fuel cell and micro-turbine generator to generate power to local load and connecting to grid/micro-grids that decrease the dependence on fossil fuels. The hybrid system is a better option for construction of modern electrical grids that includes economic, environmental and social benefits. An overview of different distributed generation technologies has been presented. This paper puts forward a comprehensive review of optimal sizing, energy management, operating and control strategies and integration of different renewable energy sources to constitute a hybrid system. The feasibility of the different controllers such as microcontroller, proportional integral controller, hysteresis controller and fuzzy controller are presented. The controller is a closed loop feedback mechanism used for power regulation which achieves zero steady state error and the output signal generated from the controller produces desired output response.

AB  - A complete product design cycle should include the following three stages: target setting, product design and development, and product validation. In the first target setting stage, it is required to understand the voice of customers (VOC), define the extreme customer usage conditions, acquire the duty cycle or customer usage data for the target, and cascade the top-down VOC targets from vehicle to system and component levels. In the second stage of product design and development, the multi-objective design optimization in the virtual analysis domain needs to be performed, where the analytical tools to design the products for various design criteria should have been developed and in place for analyses. In the final product validation stage, the test methods with a limited sample size are required to demonstrate the reliability of the product population for meeting the specific design functional and performance requirements. Since the test results exhibit significant statistical variations, these test methods (named the reliability demonstration test methods) are the most important mechanism to ensure a successful product launch for durability, reliability and quality. Again, due to the limited sample size for testing, a specific reliability and confidence target should be predetermined to be demonstrated by these test methods. The focus of this paper is to review the theoretical background and discuss the pros and cons of commonly used reliability demonstration test methods. Depending on the failure criterion in product validation testing, these reliability demonstration test methods can be categorized into the methods for non-repairable and repairable systems. For a non-repairable system, the test is considered complete, censored or suspended as the system fails, while a repairable system allows the actions required to restore/renew a failed system to operational status. The methods of interest for non-repairable systems include the test-to-failure method, the test-to-bogey method, the extended life test bogey method, and the step-stress accelerated life test method. Repairable systems are often modeled with the non-homogeneous Poisson process which includes the Duane and the Crow reliability growth models.

The rough set belief rule model builds the belief rule expectation for classification and recognition. It is not only considered the effects of single condition attributes to decision, but also the multi-attributes. The example analysis and comparing with the R0.5(X) model indicates the validity and advantage of this model. In evaluation model, aiming at the intrusion detection system of two types of errors (false positive and false negative), the trust evaluation of the whole intrusion detection system is given. It is not only from the macro, but also for each rule. According to the trust of each rule, the corresponding rules are selected again for the lower trust rules. So, the discern ability of intrusion detection system would be improved. The simulation experiment results show that the model can effectively evaluate the trust of the intrusion detection system.

AB  - Summary
This study highlights the need for water resource planning and management using expert knowledge to model known extreme hydrologic variability in complex hydrologic systems with lack of data. The Zayandehrud River Basin in Iran is used as an example of complex water system; this study provides a comprehensive description of the basin, including its water demands (municipal, agricultural, industrial and environmental) and water supply resources (rivers, inter-basin water transfer and aquifers). The objective of this study is to evaluate near future conditions of the basin (from Oct./2015 to Sep./2019) considering the current water management policies and climate change conditions, referred as Baseline scenario. A planning model for the Zayandehrud basin was built to evaluate the Baseline scenario, the period of hydrologic analysis is 21years, (from Oct./1991 to Sep./2011); it was calibrated for 17years and validated for 4years using a Historic scenario that considered historic water supply, infrastructure and hydrologic conditions. Because the Zayandehrud model is a planning model and not a hydrologic model (rainfall–runoff model), an Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is used to generate synthetic natural flows considering temperature and precipitation as inputs. This model is an expert knowledge and data based model which has the benefits of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS). Outputs of the ANFIS model were compared to the Historic scenario results and are used in the Baseline scenario. Three metrics are used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the ANFIS model. Water supply results of the Baseline scenario are analyzed using five performance criteria: time-based and volumetric reliability, resilience, vulnerability and maximum deficit. One index, the Water Resources Sustainability Index is used to summarize the performance criteria results and to facilitate comparison among trade-offs. Results for the Baseline scenario show that water demands will be supplied at the cost of depletion of surface and groundwater resource, making this scenario undesirable, unsustainable and with the potential of irreversible negative impact in water sources. Hence, the current water management policy is not viable; there is a need for additional water management policies that reduce water demand through improving irrigation efficiency and reduction of groundwater extraction for sustainable water resources management in the Zayandehrud basin.

AB  - With increasing concern about global warming, greenhouse gas emissions and rising fuel prices, non-motorized modes, such as bicycle are gaining importance as viable mode in urban transportation worldwide. In small sized Indian cities non-motorized transportation accounts for over two thirds of all trips, but with increase in purchasing power and affordability, Indian commuters are leaning towards motorized private modes leading to a rapid growth in motorized vehicle population and thus increasingly congested roadways and urban air pollution. At this juncture it is very important to investigate that what influences people's mode choice in general and bicycle mode choice in particular. This study has identified specific attitudinal attributes related to Physical factors, Psychological factors, Travel Time sensitivity, Economic aspects, Congestion, Parking, Route or Link level facilities, Route topography, Safety related factors, Security related factor, Environmental awareness and Weather related factors. A travel behavior survey with questionnaire designed to address these attributes was conducted to understand user's attitude toward bicycling in a small Indian city. The survey outcomes were then used in exploratory factor analysis (EFA), which revealed Perceived Benefits, Physical Barriers, Safety Hazards, Social Barriers, and Road Condition to be the major factor classes influencing bicycle mode choice. In order to compare user perception with expert perception, a pair-wise comparison using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has also been performed on factors related to user-specific, route-related and journey-related components. The results reveal physical factors, safety related concerns and route topography to be the key and common set of parameters influencing bicycle choice both from the user's and as well as expert's point of view.

AB  - Renewable energy sources are certain to play a key role in the future energy generation due to the rapid depletion of conventional sources of energy. The solar and wind energy are the major renewable energy sources which have the potential to meet the energy crisis to some extent. However, such sources when explored independently are not completely reliable because of the unpredictable nature. Whereas their use as hybrid energy systems seems to be more reliable and cost effective, due to the complementary nature of these two resources. In this paper an attempt has been made to discuss a systematic review related to hybrid PV/wind energy systems with battery storage. The work as presented in the manuscript will help the researchers to explore such hybrid energy systems for further improvements in terms of designing, analyzing and integrating such systems into the power network.

AB  - Due to the increasing global environmental consciousness and sustainability concerns, different industries that deal with Reverse Logistics (RL) are seeking methods to measure and analyze the impacts of their RL activities on the environment. However, making the greenest decision in the vague and complex area of RL makes this process somewhat difficult. Hence, to address these issues and provide a more meticulous and closer approach to the real world situations, a FUZZY-VIKOR method using interval-valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is proposed in the current research. As the further discussions explain, first, the significant factors in environmental sound practices together with the main processes and recovery options in RL are identified. Second, the influences of each green environmental factor on each RL recovery option are analyzed and ranked. To obtain concise results, the elicitation of experts is sought from among academicians and industry. The final results illustrate that, intriguingly, disposing of the returns has the lowest negative impact on the environment; thereby the best recovery option, while reselling of the returns was perceived as the worst recovery option. This research also suggests new directions for future research. From the managerial point of view, it would be interesting to study a sustainable reverse logistics through the proposed model. We only considered the impacts of environmental factors on RL, while the final decision will be more exact if the economic and societal aspects of RL are also analyzed. In addition, to reflect the technical views of all the stakeholders in RL towards the best recovery option and also take into account their concerns, we suggest designing a group decision making model across the RL using the Fuzzy-MADM methods.

AB  - Active flow control, which has great application prospects in aerodynamic design, can restrain flow separation and reduce drag. In this paper, a newly developed synthetic jet device with non-linear oscillation of the reciprocating piston actuator into the pipe is introduced and applied to control flow field of backward-facing step. An in-looped design optimization system based on experimental data adopting hybrid searching algorithm is constructed and applied to optimize parameters of this synthetic jet device. The optimum state based on experiment restrains separation dramatically, which validates the efficiency of the design optimization strategy and the excellent performance of synthetic jet device. The optimum jet slot angle is 127.5° and the optimum frequency is 35Hz. Then, power consumed in driving reciprocator is considered to derive a multi-objective optimum scheme. With theoretical analysis and experimental data of velocity profiles and Reynolds stress distributions, flow control mechanism of synthetic jet device is preliminarily revealed. The optimization process and the analysis of optimum state provide guidance to the design of active flow control devices.

AB  - Handheld mobile devices have evolved from simple voice communication devices to general purpose devices capable of executing complex applications. Despite this evolution, the applications executing on the mobile devices suffer due to their constrained resources. The constraints such as limited battery lifetime, limited storage and processing capabilities produce an adverse impact on the performance of applications executing on the mobile devices. Computation offloading addresses the issue of limited resources by transferring the computation workload to other systems having better resources. It may be oriented towards extending battery lifetime, enhancing storage capacity or improving the performance of an application. In this paper, we perform a survey of the computation offloading strategies correlated with performance improvement for an application. We categorize these approaches in terms of their workload distribution and offloading decisions. We also describe the evolution of the computation offloading based environment as well as a categorization of application partitioning mechanisms adopted in various contributions. Furthermore, we present a parameter-wise comparison of automated frameworks, the application domains that benefit from computation offloading and the future challenges impeding the evolution of computation offloading.

AB  - Green supplier development has became necessity as organizations increasingly compete on environmental supply chain capabilities. This paper aims to determine green/environmental performance of supplier, and define which suppliers need to improve their conditions about environmental issues, and identify which suppliers should be included to green supplier development programs to enhance their environmental performance. Therefore, primarily, performance criteria and green supplier evaluation criteria were determined via a survey, then factor analysis was conducted to evaluate validity of factors. Then two step clustering was performed by using c-means clustering method. In the first step of clustering, all suppliers of a firm performing in automobile industry were clustered according to criteria-delivery, quality, cost and service. Thus best performing suppliers were determined. In the second step of clustering, best performing suppliers determined in the first step of clustering were evaluated with environmental/green criteria. As a result of clustering, best performing suppliers were splitted to three groups according to green criteria-good, medium, poor. Lastly, suppliers within the poor group were sequenced by using VIKOR method in order to include green supplier development programs.

A conventional speed-based lead-lag PSS is used in this work. The parameters of the Cuckoo Search based Power System Stabilizer (CSPSS) are optimized simultaneously to shift the unstable or poorly damped electromechanical mode eigenvalues of all operating conditions to a D-shape zone in the left half of the s-plane. A multiobjective eigenvalue based objective function is designed to optimize a problem involving the damping factor and damping ratio of the electromechanical modes. To show the effectiveness and the robustness of CSPSS, time domain simulations, eigenvalue analysis and performance indices are presented and compared with Genetic Algorithm based PSSs (GAPSS) and Particle Swarm Optimization based PSO (PSOPSS) under wide range of operating conditions and severe disturbances. It is observed that CSPSS exhibits improved damping performance compare to GAPSS and PSOPSS.

AB  - The increasing number of affected people due to disasters, the complexity and unpredictability of these phenomena and the different problems encountered in the planning and response in different scenarios, establish a need to find better measures and practices in order to reduce the human and economic loss in this kind of events. However this is not an easy task considering the great uncertainty these phenomena present including the multiple number of possible scenarios in terms of location, probability of occurrence and impact, the difficulty in estimating the demand and supply, the complexity of determining the number and type of resources both available and needed and the intricacy to establish the exact location of the demand, the supply and the possible damaged infrastructure, among many others. Disaster Operations Management has become very popular and, considering the properties of disasters, the use of tools and methodologies such as OR have been given a lot of attention in recent years. The present work provides a literature review on the OR models with some stochastic component applied to Disaster Operations Management (DOM), along with an analysis of these stochastic components and the techniques used by different authors to cope with them as well as a detailed database on the consulted papers, which differentiates this research from other reviews developed during the same period, in order to give an insight on the state of the art in the topic and determine possible future research directions.

AB  - The question of how to assess research outputs published in journals is now a global concern for academics. Numerous journal ratings and rankings exist, some featuring perceptual and peer-review-based journal ranks, some focusing on objective information related to citations, some using a combination of the two. This research consolidates existing journal rankings into an up-to-date and comprehensive list. Existing approaches to determining journal rankings are significantly advanced with the application of a new classification approach, ‘random forests’, and data envelopment analysis. As a result, a fresh look at a publication׳s place in the global research community is offered. While our approach is applicable to all management and business journals, we specifically exemplify the relative position of ‘operations research, management science, production and operations management’ journals within the broader management field, as well as within their own subject domain.

AB  - 40% of the world's population lacks access to adequate supplies of water and sanitation services to sustain human health. In fact, more than 780 million people lack access to safe water supplies and about 2.5 billion people lack access to basic sanitation. Appropriate technology for water supply and sanitation (Watsan) systems is critical for sustained access to these services. Current approaches for the selection of Watsan technologies in developing communities have a high failure rate. It is estimated that 30%–60% of Watsan installed infrastructures in developing countries are not operating. Inappropriate technology is a common explanation for the high rate of failure of Watsan infrastructure, particularly in lower-income communities (Palaniappan et al., 2008). This paper presents the capacity factor analysis (CFA) model, for the assessment of a community's capacity to manage and sustain access to water supply and sanitation services. The CFA model is used for the assessment of a community's capacity to operate, and maintain a municipal sanitation service (MSS) such as, drinking water supply, wastewater and sewage treatment, and management of solid waste. The assessment of the community's capacity is based on seven capacity factors that have been identified as playing a key role in the sustainability of municipal sanitation services in developing communities (Louis, 2002). These capacity factors and their constituents are defined for each municipal sanitation service. Benchmarks and international standards for the constituents of the CFs are used to assess the capacity factors. The assessment of the community's capacity factors leads to determine the overall community capacity level (CCL) to manage a MSS. The CCL can then be used to assist the community in the selection of appropriate Watsan technologies for their MSS needs. The selection is done from Watsan technologies that require a capacity level to operate them that matches the assessed CCL of the community.

AB  - Cloud computing enables many applications of Web services and rekindles the interest of providing ERP services via the Internet. It has the potentials to reshape the way IT services are consumed. Recent research indicates that ERP delivered thru SaaS will outperform the traditional IT offers. However, distributing a service compared to distributing a product is more complicated because of the immateriality, the integration and the one-shot-principle referring to services. This paper defines a CloudERP platform on which enterprise customers can select web services and customize a unique ERP system to meet their specific needs. The CloudERP aims to provide enterprise users with the flexibility of renting an entire ERP service through multiple vendors. This paper also addresses the challenge of composing web services and proposes a web-based solution for automating the ERP service customization process. The proposed service composition method builds on the genetic algorithm concept and incorporates with knowledge of web services extracted from the web service platform with the rough set theory. A system prototype was built on the Google App Engine platform to verify the proposed composition process. Based on experimental results from running the prototype, the composition method works effectively and has great potential for supporting a fully functional CloudERP platform.

AB  - Multiple lean metrics representing performance for various aspects of lean can be consolidated into one holistic measure for lean, called the lean index, of which there are two types. In this article it was established that the qualitative based lean index are subjective while the quantitative types lack scope. Subsequently, an appraisal is done on techniques for quantifying qualitative lean metrics so that the lean index is a hybrid of both, increasing the confidence in the information derived using the lean index. This ensures every detail of lean within a system is quantified, allowing daily tracking of lean. The techniques are demonstrated in a print packaging manufacturing case.

Viral diffusion of information through social communities influences and promotes the image and reputation of a tourist destination. New media are therefore crucial in discovering and enhancing notoriety of natural and cultural heritage of small or less known areas. We present, by means of a multicriteria methodology, a way to summarize customer (tourist) evaluations of a destination and to compare them with the DMO (Destination Management Organization) evaluation in terms of, e.g., cultural heritage, attractions and natural resources. The results are expressed as inductive rules representing how multiple ratings and reviews posted by tourists could be conveyed into single scores useful for travel destination selection and benchmarking.

AB  - This article presents a model to calculate the impact on the grid of the injection of electricity generated from photovoltaic systems. The methodology combines the use of Geographical Information System tools to classify the optimal locations for the installation of photovoltaic systems with the calculation of the impact into microgrids of the electricity generated in such locations. The case study is focused on Murcia region, in South-east Spain, and on medium size photovoltaic systems. The locations have been selected from a Geographical Information System database including several parameters, and evaluated and classified using a fuzzy version of the multicriteria decision method called Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. In order to obtain the weights for the criteria used in the evaluation, the Analytic Hierarchy Process has been used. Finally, using meteorological data from a small set of possible locations, the impact on the grid arising from the injection of power generated from photovoltaic systems that are connected to the grid via a module implementing different control electronic strategies has been calculated. Different electronic control strategies have been modeled to demonstrate that stabilization of the electrical parameters of a microgrid can be obtained within 500ms in all cases, even when a relatively large power surge, or slower variations, are injected into the grid from the medium size photovoltaic systems.

AB  - From a business perspective, cloud computing has revolutionized the information and communication technology (ICT) industry by offering scalable and on-demand ICT services as well as innovative pricing plans such as pay-per-use and subscription. Considering the economic benefits of cloud computing, cloud-based design and manufacturing (CBDM) has been proposed as a new paradigm in digital manufacturing and design innovation. Although CBDM has the potential to reduce costs associated with high performance computing (HPC) and maintaining ICT infrastructures in the context of engineering design and manufacturing, it is challenging to justify the potential cost savings associated with HPC in the cloud because of the complexity in the cost-benefit analysis of migrating to CBDM. In response, this paper provides important insights into the economics of CBDM by identifying key cost factors and potential pricing models that can influence decision making on whether migrating to the cloud is economically justifiable. Specifically, the cost breakdown of adopting CBDM is presented. The general key benefits are demonstrated using real case studies. In addition, a hypothetical application example is presented to compare costs in CBDM with that of traditional in-house design and manufacturing. Finally, some of the key issues and road blocks are outlined.

AB  - Technology evolution and energy of particle impact both plays a major role in inducing multi-cycle transient fault (longer duration transient) in a device. However, designing an optimized multi-cycle fault tolerant system is non-trivial. This paper presents a novel design space exploration (DSE) approach for multi-cycle transient fault tolerant datapath based on user power-delay constraints during high level synthesis (HLS). To the best of the authors’ belief, this is the first work to solve this problem in the literature so far. More specifically, the current work in the literature so far utilizes ‘triple modular redundancy (TMR)’ to design a fault tolerant datapath, however, this paper proposes a ‘dual modular redundancy (DMR) design with equivalent circuit’ scheme to achieve the same. The novel equivalent circuit that works with DMR systems performs the function of extracting the correct output from the DMR design. Further, the proposed work is the first work in the literature that handles multi-cycle transient faults during design space exploration of fault tolerant datapath. Therefore, key contributions of this paper are as follows: (a) novel multi-cycle transient fault tolerant algorithm that has capability to isolate original and duplicate units in a DMR with respect to the transient fault; (b) novel DSE approach that combines our fault tolerant algorithm along with user specified conflicting power-performance constraint that guides this intractable search problem to reach an high quality fault tolerant solution without violating the power budget and delay requirement; (c) integrates a heuristic based on bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA) that performs adaptive searching. Finally, results indicated an average improvement in Quality of Results (QoR) of >24% and reduction in hardware usage of >57% of the final solution compared to similar approach.

AB  - The client’s choice of contractor at the project prequalification stage is critical as the selected contractor is responsible for the overall coordination of a project. Although a wide variety of criteria have been employed to develop models for contractor selection, one critical component of their capability – management performance – has historically been among the least addressed but, we argue, most critical elements in a useful selection model. Even in the cases when management performance is considered, it has typically focused only on objective outcome criteria of limited predictive power, such as contractor time and cost performance. This paper reports on the results of a study to develop a comprehensive contractor evaluation model that directly addresses the contractor management capabilities and practices as a critical additional element at the prequalification stage. Using a multi-step research process, including extensive literature review, analysis and synthesis of critical contractor management performance factors, development of an analytic network project (ANP) model, and subsequent case study and field validation, we identified a robust model that enhances the decision support tools for the client organization by creating databases for comparing multiple contractors with respect to management practices. In addition, the evaluation of this prequalification criterion permits the contractors to focus on their efforts to address the critical management practices to improve their project performance.

AB  - For product design and development, crowdsourcing shows huge potential for fostering creativity and has been regarded as one important approach to acquiring innovative concepts. Nevertheless, prior to the approach could be effectively implemented, the following challenges concerning crowdsourcing should be properly addressed: (1) burdensome concept review process to deal with a large amount of crowd-sourced design concepts; (2) insufficient consideration in integrating design knowledge and principles into existing data processing methods/algorithms for crowdsourcing; and (3) lack of a quantitative decision support process to identify better concepts. To tackle these problems, a product concept evaluation and selection approach, which comprises three modules, is proposed. These modules are respectively: (1) a data mining module to extract meaningful information from online crowd-sourced concepts; (2) a concept re-construction module to organize word tokens into a unified frame using domain ontology and extended design knowledge; and (3) a decision support module to select better concepts in a simplified manner. A pilot study on future PC (personal computer) design was conducted to demonstrate the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach is promising and may help to improve the concept review and evaluation efficiency; facilitate data processing using design knowledge; and enhance the reliability of concept selection decisions.

AB  - Buildings are responsible for some 40% of the total final energy consumption in the European Union and about 40% of the world’s primary energy consumption. Hence, the reduction of primary energy consumption is important for the overall energy chain. The scope of the current work is to assess the energy efficiency measures in the residential and small commercial sector and to develop a methodology and a software tool for their optimal prioritization. The criteria used for the prioritization of energy efficiency measures in this article are the primary energy consumption and the initial investment cost. The developed methodology used is generic and could be implemented in the case of a new building or retrofitting an existing building. A multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) needs to be solved and the weighted sum method is used. Moreover, the novelty of this work is that a software tool has been developed using ‘Matlab®’ which is generic, very simple and time efficient and can be used by a Decision Maker (DM). Two case studies have been developed, one for a new building and one for retrofitting an existing one, in two cities with different climate characteristics. The building was placed in Edinburgh in the UK and Athens in Greece and the analysis showed that the primary energy consumption and the initial investment cost are inversely proportional.

AB  - Landslides are dangerous natural hazards. Because of their threat, a comprehensive landslide susceptibility map should be produced to reduce the possible damages to people and infrastructure. The quality of landslide susceptibility maps is influenced by many factors, such as the quality of input data and the selection of mathematical models. This study aimed to identify the optimal quantitative method for landslide susceptibility mapping in Mizunami City, Japan. Three mathematical methods, logistic regression (LR), bivariate statistical analysis (BS), and multivariate adaptive regression spline models (MARSplines), were used to create landslide-susceptibility maps by comparing the past landslide distribution and the conditioning factor thematic maps. A landslide inventory map with a total of 222 landslide locations was extracted from aerial photographs provided by NIED (National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention, Japan). Then, the landslide inventory was randomly divided into two datasets: 50% was used for training the models and the remaining 50% for validation purposes. The landslide inventory map provided by NIED and an area under the ROC curve were used to evaluate model performance. We found that the MARSpline method resulted in a better prediction rate (79%) when compared to LR (75%) and BS (77%). In addition, a higher percentage of landslide polygons were found in the high to very high classes using the MARSpline method. Therefore, we concluded that the MARSpline method was the most efficient method for landslide susceptibility mapping in this study area.

AB  - There is a need to facilitate learning from failures in the context of natural and man-made disasters. This paper investigates the multi-faceted nature of research in disasters and the aspect of hybrid approaches in modelling within this domain. The paper applies a framework of reliability and multiple criteria decision analysis techniques to the case of the Hurricane Katrina disaster of 2005. It is shown how this hybrid model can be used through an integrative approach to perform a systematic analysis that can lead to learning from failures. The proposed framework incorporates and integrates Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) analysis and the Risk Priority Number (RPN) concept, together with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) which is used as a simulation model for decision support. It is shown how the proposed integrated framework can contribute to our understanding of failures and enhances the ability to extract lessons from failures or disasters. Such lessons are then mapped into specific decisions for prevention, and resource allocations, to help avoid a repeat disaster.
