AB  - Intelligent products are an undeniable asset for efficient product lifecycle management (PLM), providing ways to capture events related to physical objects at various locations and times. Today and more than ever before, PLM tools and systems must be built upon standards for enhancing interoperability among all product stakeholders and developing tools independent of specific vendors, applications, and operating systems. Based on this observation, this paper develops strategies to improve “information sustainability” in PLM environments using standardized communication interfaces defined by a recent standard proposal named quantum lifecycle management (QLM) messaging standards. More concretely, data synchronization models based upon QLM standards are developed to enable the synchronization of product-related information among various systems, networks, and organizations involved throughout the product lifecycle. Our proposals are implemented and assessed based on two distinct platforms defined in the healthcare and home automation sectors.

AB  - As our understanding of genetics has increased, so has the number of genetic tests that have entered clinical practice. Given the need of many European health care systems to contain costs, the question of how to prioritise genetic tests fairly has become an emerging concern. This study uses a discrete-choice experiment to assess the value judgements of clinical geneticists, patient representatives and other stakeholders regarding the prioritisation of genetic tests. The respondents chose between two hypothetical scenarios that differed in severity of the disease, risk of the disease, aim of the test, medical benefit of the test, and costs of the test. Standard logit models and mixed effects models were used to estimate the weights different stakeholders attached to attribute levels. Responses from 594 participants were analysed. The most highly valued attribute levels were a proven medical benefit of the test, high risk of having the disease and low costs of the test. Results also showed that rankings differ between clinical geneticists and other stakeholders. The priority weights determined within this study can inform the policy debate and improve the consistency of prioritisation in genetics. Further stakeholder deliberation is needed to explore their most appropriate use in decision practice.

AB  - This paper systematically presents recent research on the integrated optimization of hydroelectric energy in the upper and middle Yangtze River. The primary techniques related to the management of these systems, such as hydrology and hydrological modelling, flood routing optimization for power generation, flood control, ecological operations, multi-objective optimization and multi-attribute risk decision-making, were introduced. Moreover, each of these techniques was described in detail, including its specific processes, equations, and tables. We applied these methodologies to real engineering problem modelling and subsequently highlighted the applications of optimal operation for multi-reservoir systems in the upper and middle Yangtze River. In addition, the primary challenges of multi-reservoir operations in the upper and middle Yangtze River are described.

The results show that the usage of the mobile services are not significantly affected by how consumers choose smart phone handset, and how they subscribe to the mobile network. For the effect of users’ demographic characteristics, gender’s effect is observed, but is not as obvious as what have been pointed out in the literature. The most noticeable relationship is the effect of demographic variables on the attributes of mobile network. Specifically, users’ gender, age, occupation and income are found to have significant effects on the contract with voice and 3G Internet, and the monthly 3G Internet fee.

AB  - The number of model parameters of a 2k factorial design grows exponentially. When the number of factors is large, numerous higher-order interactions constitute a vast majority of the model parameters while many of them do not exist or are insignificant. The classic methods of fractional factorial designs, Plackett–Burman designs, Taguchi designs, etc. seek an already developed and often cataloged design that fits exactly the problem being tackled or select a design that fits it the most. Most, if not all, of these designs were developed in absence of convenient computation tools and enjoy computational simplicity. The necessary number of treatment combinations for unbiased estimation of significant parameters is often exceeded; undesirable confounding, i.e., biased estimation, is difficult to avoid. An opposite approach is to determine, for any set of model parameters considered as significant, a corresponding set of equal (and minimum) number of treatment combinations for unbiased parameter estimation. A companion feature of that approach is active avoidance of confounding. In addition, if the experimenter, particularly when unsure of the “borderline” significance of some parameters, can attempt to sequence model parameters in non-increasing order of magnitude (based on prior knowledge or subjective judgment), a corresponding sequence of treatment combinations can be numerically determined (with one treatment combination added for each additional possibly significant model parameter). Recently, a simple design pattern was proposed with which such a sequence of treatment combinations can be intuitively and easily obtained, without numerical computation. However, that pattern requires for the estimability of an interaction that all main effects and all lower-order interactions among all factors involved in the experiment have been estimated. For example, the interaction AB may not be estimable without main effect C having been estimated first. This paper relaxes that requirement and extends the use condition of the proposed approach to virtually all practical situations and presents a simple algorithm to estimate model parameters recursively. As sequential experimentation progresses, no experiments already conducted could be considered unnecessary for unbiased estimation of significant parameters, and hence “forward compatibility” in minimizing the number of treatment combinations is achieved. Therefore, such optimality may be referred to as FC-optimality or, more intuitively, as optimality of ‘one more treatment combination for one more parameter’ and ‘1-1-Optimality’ for short.

AB  - Currently, energy systems are not fully sustainable due to the heavy power demands provoked by high population and increasing level of the living standard and economic growth. Hence, it requires significant efforts to conserve the resources and ensure the sustainability in energy demand and in its management from a nation perspective. The Indian economy is growing at a good pace and there is an enormous demand for resources and energy in the country. In this regard, this paper aims to identify and prioritize the indicators to develop a decision-support framework for the sustainability assessment in energy planning and management in Indian context. To achieve it, this work proposes to use a two-phase research methodology. In first phase, a comprehensive literature review and expert’s inputs are used to identify the important five key dimensions of indicators and twenty-five indicators for assessing the sustainability in energy planning and management. In second phase, fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used for prioritizing of indicators to develop an integrated sustainability assessment framework for energy systems. ‘Environmental’ indicator dimension has been reported as the most important dimension for assessing the sustainability in energy planning and management. The proposed decision framework may offer some valuable guidelines for policy makers to develop their plan of action in terms of design of both short term and long term flexible decision strategies, to assess the sustainability in energy systems. Sensitivity analysis has also been made to investigate the robustness and priority ranking stability of the proposed sustainability assessment framework.

AB  - The goal of this work was to develop Fourier-transform-near-infrared-spectroscopy-based methodology for monitoring kinetics and estimating the biodegradation rate of coniferous pulp paper. Two experiments with paper-degrading fungi were tested: one with Chaetomium globosum alone and the other with a mixture of Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma viride, and Penicillium funiculosum. Paper sheets made of fibers with the addition of 0, 2, 3, or 5% of cationic starch and resinous adhesive were used as test samples. In order to quantify the resistance of the paper to biodegradation, tests of breaking length and evaluation of the degree of fungal infestation were performed during infestation. It was found that addition of cationic starch and resin adhesives improved mechanical properties of paper; however, it also increased susceptibility to fungal colonization. Degradation of paper colonized by C. globosum was more advanced and exhibited more rapid kinetics. Spectral analysis revealed that spectra were most varying in bands 4283, 4400, 4742, and 4808 cm−1, which correspond to –CH, and –OH functional groups of cellulose and hemicelluloses. Differences in spectra were in good agreement with the reference methods; therefore this technique has potential for monitoring the paper biodegradation process and predicting changes in the paper's mechanical properties.

AB  - Cloud computing has spurred the creation of a multitude of services that use the cloud to deliver their products on-demand. Behind it, stand multiple “Cloud Providers” that in the past few years have created data-centers, spread around the world, creating a mesh of distributed resources that can meet high availability and quality of service requirements. The growing number of cloud clients demand reliability, performance and better cost-to-performance ratios. Recently, scientific research has focused on the optimization of interlinked cloud systems, an aim which requires strategies for allocation of resources and distribution of computing tasks between them, while also considering their cost along with any factors that may differentiate them. In this study, we have evaluated the use of simulated annealing and thermodynamic simulated annealing in the scheduling of a dynamic multi-cloud system with virtual machines of heterogeneous performance serving Bag-of-Tasks applications. The scheduling heuristics applied, consider multiple criteria when scheduling said applications and try to optimize both for performance and cost, while also taking into account the heterogeneity of the virtual machines. Simulation results indicate that the use of these heuristics can have a significant impact in performance while maintaining a good cost-performance trade-off.

AB  - In recent years, Iran has experienced many landslides due to high tectonic activity, and a variety of geological and climatic conditions. This paper proposes a novel hybrid model based on step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to evaluate landslide susceptible areas using geographical information system (GIS). At first, based on an inventory map, landslide locations were randomly divided into two parts, 70% of which were used for generating the landslide hazard map and 30% of which were used for the validation of the model. Then, twelve landslide predisposing factors, such as lithology, slope angle, slope aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, altitude, distance to streams, distance to faults, distance to roads, land use, seismicity, and rainfall were considered for the analysis. All the factors were then weighted by the SWARA method. Considering the nature of predisposing factors, they were split into two groups, factors with discrete data and factors with continuous data. For factors with discrete data, the SWARA method was used for final weight of each class, and for factors with continuous data, results related to the center of each class were obtained from the SWARA method. Subsequently, AFNIS was used to obtain weight of each value. All the values obtained from the model were then used to generate the landslide hazard map of the study area. Finally, the landslide hazard map was validated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) using both success rate curve and prediction rate curve. 70% of observed landslides were used for the former while the remaining was used for the latter. The validation results showed that the area under the success rate curve and prediction rate curve (AUC) are 0.84 and 0.80 respectively. Additionally, the prediction performance of the SWARA method for landslide hazard mapping was investigated and the results were compared with those obtained from the proposed model. The comparison revealed that the developed model has better prediction ability for landslide hazard assessment. The results also indicated that the proposed model used in this study produced satisfactory and reliable landslide hazard map, which can be used for preliminary land use and infrastructure planning in Iran.

AB  - For many deep-rooted resource conflicts where the cultural component of ecosystem services (ES) is strong, standard monetary valuation may be methodologically difficult and not always meaningful. A deeper understanding of the value plurality of key stakeholders may be called for to develop acceptable policies. We use the Q method to analyse the perceived and actual trade-offs related to Norwegian wildlife management, a source of prominent conflict in Norway. We identify and classify distinct arguments in the wildlife management debate following the ES framework, and use the Q method to explore extant/prominent narratives characterising stakeholders' perceptions of the importance of arguments about biodiversity and ES. Finally, we reflect on whether and to what extent the Q method can contribute to our understanding of resource conflicts, underlying values, and ES trade-offs. Three clear narratives appeared: Pro-sheep grazing (cultural), pro-carnivore conservation (intrinsic) and a middle position emphasising recreational hunting (utilitarian). Despite considerable disagreement among narratives, the Q analysis also revealed areas of common ground useful for developing acceptable policies. Given the inherent complexity of socio-ecological systems, it is useful to draw from a diverse toolbox of methods, including the Q method for ES analysis.

AB  - Innovative activity of companies differs due to their sphere. This paper will focus on companies operating in the IT (Information Technology) sphere, whose business success depends on innovations more than the success of companies in any other sector. Innovations for manufacturing hi-tech products, for example, computer equipment, demand more intense (narrower) focus on product innovations owing to the fact that the basis of viability and financial well-being of hi-tech companies is demand for their products. Therefore, innovations in such companies are mostly directed at creation of new products or modernization of the already existing ones. As a consequence, in order to define the activity of IT companies more precisely we should use specific classification of innovation strategies. The innovative behavior of IT-companies is one of the main sources of competitiveness, business survival and economic growth. It is therefore important to identify and understand the factors that determine innovation behavior among IT enterprises. Innovation behavior depends on innovation capacity and is realized in a particular innovation strategy. This paper attempts to show the mechanism of choosing the most appropriate innovation strategy and the most accurate project estimation. Using the data collected on IT companies, the correlation between innovation strategies and company's performance was found.

AB  - Participation is advocated as an essential component of strategies and policies for sustainable urban mobility. This paper refers to the overall literature on participation and provides the design, test and ex-post evaluation of a deliberative-participative procedure (DPP) aimed at selecting a new scheme for the regulation of traffic and parking in the “Murat”, a central area of Bari (Italy). The potential benefits and shortcomings of participation were explicitly considered when designing a DPP which integrates three tools: an opinion poll and two deliberative arenas – the “stakeholder dialogue” and the “citizens’ jury”. The ex-post evaluation of the test confirmed ex-ante design choices. The DPP was effective and learning was generated: the use of understandable techniques for deliberation and assessment helped participants to generate an unambiguous final result which was based on the “hybridisation” of the alternative schemes proposed to the participants at the beginning of the procedure. The “last word” given to the citizens’ jury avoided that the most powerful stakeholders may capture the DPP. Only a “frustration” effect was clearly generated because of the limited involvement of the Municipality of Bari, thus confirming that the involvement of the relevant Authority is an essential requisite for successful participation. We suggest that the generation of new knowledge and learning could be further assured by the participation of citizens and stakeholders to the definition of the alternatives they will assess later.

AB  - In evaluating and selecting sustainable suppliers, we take a triple-bottom-line (profit, people and planet) approach and consider business operations as well as environmental impacts and social responsibilities of the suppliers. Different metrics are introduced to measure performance in these three areas. To examine the influences of different organizational and supply chain operating philosophies, the objectives in selection of suppliers are designed so that some of them favor profit or the business operations, others the planet or the environment and the remaining focusing on people or social responsibility. A novel methodological approach based on a Bayesian framework and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulation is developed to rank and select suppliers using specific selection objectives. This technique is also effective when smaller or missing data sets exist, which is an especially prevalent characteristic for newer and complex measures such as in a sustainability decision environment. Results obtained from the MCMC simulation provide a wealth of information about supplier performance, which form the basis for additional statistical analyses. The model allows the decision maker to execute various scenarios by changing importance weights attached to the triple-bottom-line areas. We present results for some of those scenarios with managerial and research implications and future research directions identified.

AB  - This study applies a hybrid analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate West Virginia's (WV) resource-based tourism competitiveness in relation to its neighboring states. The study also sought to investigate the utility of AHP in destination competitiveness evaluation. Ten executive directors from West Virginia's Convention and Visitors Bureaus (CVBs) and 891 visitors to West Virginia participated in this study. Findings revealed that West Virginia performed well in the areas such as availability of adventure-based and nature-based activities, and had a competitive edge on hospitality and friendliness of residents, safety and security, and value for money in shopping items. However, WV was seen to be less competitive on variety and quality of restaurants and availability of activities for children. The hybrid AHP model was shown to be a reliable tool to evaluate destination competitiveness. Theoretical and managerial implications and future research suggestions are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to evaluate the risk level for both intra-organizational cultures and for different industries in implementing an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. This study adopts the Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) method to assess ERP implementation risks, which were categorized into four dimensions: management and execution, software system, users, and technology planning. An empirical survey was conducted that utilized the collected survey data of 20 ERP experts in Taiwan to assess, rank, and improve the critical risks of ERP implementation via the FANP method. Based on the results of the FANP method, a follow-up survey of ERP end-users in different departments of three industries was conducted to assess how intra-organizational cultures and cross-industries affect users’ perceived risks a real world scenario. Our research results demonstrated that “lack of management support and assistance” is vital risk for a successful ERP implementation. Top management support and involvement are crucial and essential factors to the success of a firm's ERP implementation. “Ineffective communication with users” was found to be the second highest risk factor. The benefits of using the FANP method for evaluating the risk factors come from the clear priority weights between alternatives. Finally, this study provides suggestions to help enterprises decrease ERP risks, and enhance the chances of success of ERP implementations among intra-organizational cultures and across-industries.

KW  - Multi-channel time-slotted algorithm
AB  - Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks (WMSNs) have recently received a great deal of attention in the scientific and developers communities due to the significant advances of this technology in the wireless communication field. The main reason was that competing WMSN approaches that emerged in the last few years provide mesh capabilities (e.g., robustness, scalability, multi-hop mesh routing, or energy efficiency, among others) to conventional WSN-based applications, encouraging researchers and end users to adopt new perspectives and solutions. Unfortunately, each one of these approaches lacks some (or many) of the aforementioned mesh capabilities, not assuring, a priori, the feasibility and, especially, the long-term stability of WMSN applications. The IEEE 802.15.5 standard and, in particular, its Asynchronous Energy Saving (ASES) mode was conceived to fill this gap since it integrates, in a single solution, most of these capabilities, guaranteeing, among other benefits, a long network lifetime. However, the ASES mode has no built-in mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of hidden terminals, which sharply degrades the network performance. This fact leads us to conclude that any current WMSN approach is non-exempt of some problem, which prevents the definitive boost of this technology in the consumer market. Under these circumstances, our contribution to the WMSN field in this paper is a twofold proposal addressed to alleviating the hidden terminal problems in a scenario running under the most relevant design premises of ASES mode. Therefore, we first formulate a multi-objective optimization and then solve it by using Goal Programming. Both mathematical techniques are applied to obtain the best solution that simultaneously minimizes the aggregate message collision time due to hidden terminals and maximizes the network lifetime. Secondly, we propose the design of a MULti-channel TIme-scheduled algorithm for the HIdden Terminal problem avoidance (MULTI-HIT) which appropriately exploits the available bandwidth and accomplishes a straightforward coordination between any sender–receiver pair. Finally, the analysis and simulation experiments are presented and their results carefully discussed, demonstrating the effectiveness of both proposals in the WMSN arena.

In this paper, we surveyed existing incident handling and digital forensic literature with the aims of contributing to the knowledge gap(s) in handling incidents in the cloud environment. 139 English language publications between January 2009 and May 2014 were located by searching various sources including the websites of standard bodies (e.g. National Institute of Standards and Technology) and academic databases (e.g. Google Scholar, IEEEXplore, ACM Digital Library, Springer and ScienceDirect). We then propose a conceptual cloud incident handling model that brings together incident handling, digital forensic and the Capability Maturity Model for Services to more effectively handle incidents for organisations using the cloud. A discussion of open research issues concludes this survey.

KW  - Surveillance
KW  - Economics
KW  - Disease control
AB  - Animal health surveillance is a complex activity that involves multiple stakeholders and provides decision support across sectors. Despite progress in the design of surveillance systems, some technical challenges remain, specifically for emerging hazards. Surveillance can also be impacted by political interests and costly consequences of case reporting, particularly in relation to international trade. Constraints on surveillance can therefore be of technical, economic and political nature. From an economic perspective, both surveillance and intervention are resource-using activities that are part of a mitigation strategy. Surveillance provides information for intervention decisions and thereby helps to offset negative effects of animal disease and to reduce the decision uncertainty associated with choices on disease control. It thus creates monetary and non-monetary benefits, both of which may be challenging to quantify. The technical relationships between surveillance, intervention and loss avoidance have not been established for most hazards despite being important consideration for investment decisions. Therefore, surveillance cannot just be maximised to minimise intervention costs. Economic appraisals of surveillance need to be done on a case by case basis for any hazard considering both surveillance and intervention performance, the losses avoided and the values attached to them. This can be achieved by using an evaluation approach which provides a systematic investigation of the worth or merit of surveillance activities. Evaluation is driven by a specific evaluation question which for surveillance systems commonly considers effectiveness, efficiency, implementation and/or compliance issues. More work is needed to provide guidance on the appropriate selection of evaluation attributes and general good practice in surveillance evaluation. Due to technical challenges, economic constraints and variable levels of capacity, the implementation of surveillance systems remains variable. Political and legal issues are also influential. A particular challenge exists during outbreaks when surveillance needs to be conducted under emergency conditions. Decision support systems can help make epidemiologically and economically sound choices amongst surveillance options. However, contingency planning is advisable so that pre-defined options allow for rapid decision making.

AB  - Road traffic injuries and fatalities have nowadays been recognized as one of the most important public health issues that requires concerted efforts for effective and sustainable prevention. Given the fact that more and more countries are taking steps to improve their road safety situation, there is a growing need for these countries to work together more closely, because there are quite a number of common problems that can be identified in close cooperation, and improvement can be expected by learning lessons from existing best practices in other countries. As a consequence, comparison between a range of countries in terms of their road safety performance and development or – using state-of-the-art terminology – inter-national benchmarking of road safety, is currently widely advocated by most countries and international bodies as an emerging methodology for road safety improvement. However, performing a successful road safety benchmarking practice is by no means easy. Challenges exist from the definition of benchmarking framework at the very beginning to the final decisions in terms of identification of best practices and establishment of a continuous process of mutual learning. In this paper, the theoretical background of the benchmarking approach is introduced, and a specific benchmarking cycle for road safety is established which consists of five core activities. Moreover, as a valuable benchmarking tool, the development of a road safety index is highlighted, and some theoretical and practical issues on this subject are discussed.

AB  - This paper presents a review of the optimization techniques and strategies applied to wind turbine performance optimization. The topic is addressed by identifying the most significant objectives, targets and issues, as well as the optimization formulations, schemes and models available in the published literature. The current energy demand combined with depletion of fossil-fuel reserves and stricter environmental regulations have led to the development of alternative renewable energy solutions like wind energy. The current 2030 United States target is to have at least 20% of the US energy supply by onshore and offshore wind farms. To meet these demands, wind energy costs have to be able to compete with traditional fossil fuel sources. Hence, it is essential and vital that wind turbine designers and manufactures search the optimal solution that fits the objectives under a set of design constraints. Throughout the last 30years, the objective function has evolved from the earlier maximized metric of the power coefficient to the maximization of the annual energy production. Common alternatives such as blade mass minimization and maximization of the rotor thrust and torque have been examined. However, the main objective has been focused on the minimization of the cost of energy in order for wind energy to become more competitive and economically attractive. The purpose of this paper is to review previous work that undertakes the performance optimization of horizontal wind turbines by highlighting the main aspects when tackling the wind turbine optimization problem such as: objective functions, design constraints, tools and models and optimization algorithms. In addition, in a conclusion of the review, a discussion and argument about the challenges, issues and future developments are identified.

AB  - Supplier selection, which is the basic process of finding the best supplier/suppliers to procure the items regarding various criteria, is an important decision problem to be studied. It becomes more complicated if there are various items and any supplier cannot provide all types of items individually. Such situations are called multi-item, multi-supplier environments and rarely studied in the literature. In addition, when quantity discounts are also considered, it gets more sophisticated. Although there are several studies dealing with these aspects separately, to the best knowledge of the authors, this study is the first candidate attempting to solve this type of problem with an integrated approach including Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) and Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model. This study mainly operates in two stages. In the first stage, the relative weights of each criterion for each type of item are determined via F-AHP technique. In the second stage, these outputs are used as inputs in the MILP model to determine the suppliers and the quantities to be provided. In order to validate the model, an application is performed in a gear motor company and numerical results of the problem are revealed to select the best suppliers among 6 alternatives, for the procurement of 5 items regarding 4 criteria, namely, price, quality, delivery time performance, and after sales performance, in case of quantity discounts.

AB  - Technology Transfer (TT) process has been one of the most important activities in management of innovations in products, processes and services. It has been realized that critical factors (CFs) related to TT process need to be identified and evaluated. In this study, an attempt is made to analyze ranking of CFs of technology transfer. Twenty four CFs have been sorted by carrying out extensive review of literature and categorized in to five dimensions using experts’ inputs. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology has been identified to be used for ranking of dimensions and CFs of technology transfer. All pair wise comparisons dealt with in AHP were made on the basis of opinions of experts. ‘Regulatory concerns’ has been prioritized as most important dimension of technology transfer. ‘International bodies’, ‘Government authorities’ and ‘Environmental concerns’ have been rated top three most important CFs based upon overall weight values of CFs. A conceptual model of interactions among these critical factors has also been presented which has further facilitatedtowards:proposing strategic framework; identifying practical and strategic implications; and deducing a strategic action plan for technology transfer process. This paper may help managers/practitioners to evaluate critical factors of technology transfer process towards achieving cost effective TT implementation and efficient management of resources.

Recently, this journal published a paper, which proposes a new framework of factors that impact the outcome of such battles. We apply this framework to three format battles: for wired connectivity in home applications, for wireless connectivity in home applications, and for multi-channel sound. The framework appears to be more complete than earlier frameworks, and therefore provides a better understanding of interface format battles. Firms can use this framework to make more accurate forecasts about the winner, if any, of a format battle, and can adjust their strategies by exploiting certain factors to enhance their chances of success.

AB  - Decision making is required by many tasks, such as shopping, nowadays assisted by software systems, and providing support to the decision making process is a feature that would significantly improve such systems. Many decision support systems and related approaches have been proposed to that purpose, but they often involve tedious elicitation processes or previously collected data. In this paper, we propose an automated decision making technique, which chooses an option from the set of those available based on preferences and priorities expressed in a high-level preference language, exploiting natural-language terms, such as expressive speech acts. Moreover, in order to make a decision, our technique goes beyond the provided preferences with psychology-inspired heuristics, which concern how humans make decisions, as provided preferences are typically not enough to resolve trade-offs among available options. Two studies were performed to evaluate our approach, and results indicate that our technique is effective both by comparing its recommendations with those made by a human expert, and by considering evaluation scores provided by users that experienced our technique.

There are five in-vehicle distracter tasks: tuning the radio to a local station, touching the touch-screen telephone menu to a certain song, talking with laboratory assistant, answering a telephone via Bluetooth headset, and finding the navigation system from Ipad4 computer. Forty young drivers completed the driving experiment on a driving simulator. Measures of fixations, saccades, and blinks are collected and analyzed. Based on the measures of driver eye movements which have significant difference between the baseline and secondary task driving conditions, the evaluation index system is built. The Analytic Network Process (ANP) theory is applied for determining the importance weight of the evaluation index in a fuzzy environment. On the basis of the importance weight of the evaluation index, Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE) method is utilized to evaluate the secondary task driving safety. Results show that driving with secondary tasks greatly distracts the driver's attention from road and the evaluation model built in this study could estimate driving safety effectively under different driving conditions.

AB  - Reducing building energy demand is a crucial part of the global response to climate change, and evolutionary algorithms (EAs) coupled to building performance simulation (BPS) are an increasingly popular tool for this task. Further uptake of EAs in this industry is hindered by BPS being computationally intensive: optimisation runs taking days or longer are impractical in a time-competitive environment. Surrogate fitness models are a possible solution to this problem, but few approaches have been demonstrated for multi-objective, constrained or discrete problems, typical of the optimisation problems in building design. This paper presents a modified version of a surrogate based on radial basis function networks, combined with a deterministic scheme to deal with approximation error in the constraints by allowing some infeasible solutions in the population. Different combinations of these are integrated with Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and applied to three instances of a typical building optimisation problem. The comparisons show that the surrogate and constraint handling combined offer improved run-time and final solution quality. The paper concludes with detailed investigations of the constraint handling and fitness landscape to explain differences in performance.

AB  - Within the fuzzy literature, the issue of ranking fuzzy intervals has been addressed by many authors, who proposed various solutions to the problem. Most of these solutions intend to find a total order on a given collection of fuzzy intervals. However, if one sees fuzzy intervals as descriptions of uncertain quantities, an alternative to rank them is to use ranking rules issued from the imprecise probabilistic literature. In this paper, we investigate ranking rules based on different statistical features (mean, median) and orderings, and relate the obtained (partial) orders to some classical proposals. In particular, we propose a generic expression of stochastic orderings, and then use it to systematically investigate extensions of the most usual stochastic orderings to fuzzy intervals. We also show some relations between those extensions, and explore their relation with existing fuzzy ranking proposals.

AB  - Treatment performance of bioretention basins closely depends on hydrologic and hydraulic factors such as rainfall characteristics and inflow and outflow discharges. An in-depth understanding of the influence of these factors on water quality treatment performance can provide important guidance for effective bioretention basin design. In this paper, hydraulic and hydrologic factors impacting pollutant removal by a bioretention basin were assessed under field conditions. Outcomes of the study confirmed that the antecedent dry period plays an important role in influencing treatment performance. A relatively long antecedent dry period reduces nitrite and ammonium concentrations while increasing the nitrate concentration, which confirms that nitrification occurs within the bioretention basin. Additionally, pollutant leaching influences bioretention basin treatment performance, reducing the nutrients removal efficiency, which was lower for high rainfall events. These outcomes will contribute to a greater understanding of the treatment performance of bioretention basins, assisting in the design, operation and maintenance of these systems.

An exploratory analysis was performed by applying nonparametric techniques to measure and compare the efficiency and sustainability in a fictitious chemical production plant. The analyzed variables were identified and it was defined the importance (weight) of each of these by using the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method. It was defined a standard to be used as a benchmark and it was identified the implemented actions (projects) to achieve the proposed targets, using the technique of Goal Programming. The variables were defined considering sustainability and efficiency performance indicators. For sustainability were used as reference the standards defined in “Responsible Care®” program and the efficiency performance indicators were chosen considering some key items used by the market to assess efficiency of a production plant.

AB  - Recommender systems are filters which suggest items or information that might be interesting to users. These systems analyze the past behavior of a user, build her profile that stores information about her interests, and exploit that profile to find potentially interesting items. The main limitation of this approach is that it may provide accurate but likely obvious suggestions, since recommended items are similar to those the user already knows. In this paper we investigate this issue, known as overspecialization or serendipity problem, by proposing a strategy that fosters the suggestion of surprisingly interesting items the user might not have otherwise discovered. The proposed strategy enriches a graph-based recommendation algorithm with background knowledge that allows the system to deeply understand the items it deals with. The hypothesis is that the infused knowledge could help to discover hidden correlations among items that go beyond simple feature similarity and therefore promote non-obvious suggestions. Two evaluations are performed to validate this hypothesis: an in vitro experiment on a subset of the hetrec2011-movielens-2k dataset, and a preliminary user study. Those evaluations show that the proposed strategy actually promotes non-obvious suggestions, by narrowing the accuracy loss.

AB  - People are lately re-considering the advantages of becoming once again an active part of the society, as they everyday discover new ways of connecting with each other towards common goals. This increasing change of attitude calls for new tools and methods as traditional tools for policy making have proved unable to predict and cope with most of today's pressing and persistent challenges. In this context, it is considered as of pivotal importance to study a set of representative set of modern Policy Making 2.0 best cases, in order to scout towards evidence-based future directions, policy propositions, documented results and conclusions. The purpose of the paper at hand is to provide policy makers, practitioners, as well as other interested stakeholders, with a bouquet of (mostly ICT-related) policy implications and practical recommendations that steam through an evidence based, domain-wide study, aiming at directing them towards more efficient and effective launch, steering and sustaining of Policy Making 2.0 initiatives. Early engagement of stakeholders, openness, user friendliness and agility in the whole procedure constitutes only a high level presentation of the propositions and implications derived as a result of the analysis that follows.

AB  - Various software packages offer a large number of customizable features to meet the specific needs of organizations. Improper selection of a software package may result in incorrect strategic decisions and subsequent economic loss of organizations. This paper presents a comparative study that aims to evaluate and select open-source electronic medical record (OS-EMR) software based on multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. A hands-on study is performed, and a set of OS-EMR software are implemented locally in separate virtual machines to closely examine the systems. Several measures as evaluation bases are specified, and systems are selected based on a set of metric outcomes by using AHP integrated with different MCDM techniques, namely, WPM, WSM, SAW, HAW, and TOPSIS. Paired sample t-test is then utilized to measure the correlations among different techniques on ranking scores and orders. Findings are as follows. (1) Significant differences exist among MCDM techniques on the basis of different integrations on ranking scores, whereas no significant differences exist among them when representing the ranking scores to the ranking orders in place of the technique scale. (2) The software GNUmed, OpenEMR, OpenMRS, and ZEPRS do not differ in ranking scores/orders of experiments for all MCDM techniques presented. On the contrary, discrepancies among the ranking scores/orders are more noticeable in other software. (3) GNUmed, OpenEMR, and OpenMRS software are the most promising candidates for providing a good basis on ranking scores/orders, whereas ZEPRS is not recommended because it records the worst ranking score/order in comparison with other OS-EMR software.

AB  - This paper provides an empirical typology of online decision-making purchasing behaviour. The study explores how the online purchase process is affected by individual decision-making style and knowledge of product. Drawing from the decision analysis and consumer behaviour literatures, we present a typology of online purchase decision-making behaviour and introduce four archetypes of online consumers. A number of experiments have been conducted in two online settings: retail banking and mobile networks. Based on an extensive video analysis, we have captured four process-related dimensions (number of cycles, duration, number of alternatives and number of criteria) using a business process modelling approach. Significant differences in all process-related dimensions were found across the four archetypes. The study improves understanding of the different types of online consumers and their process outcomes. The findings are useful for online retailers seeking to improve the way they support the four archetypes of online shoppers throughout the decision-making purchasing process.

AB  - In the search for solutions to complex real-world problems, the benefits of transdisciplinary research (TDR) have been widely heralded. Land use science appears to be a designated field for TDR. However, to date, the additional expenses of TDR are accompanied by a so far not proved added value, and empirical findings are claimed to be scarce and dispersed over several disciplines and case studies. We reviewed 299 articles obtained from a structured literature search to (1) investigate the current differences between theory and practice, (2) identify empirical findings, and (3) ascertain the contributions of TDR to promoting sustainable land use management. Our results demonstrate that, in spite of an increasing conceptual consistency in the theoretical discussion of TDR, the implementation of TDR remains a substantial challenge, in part because of the gap between theory and practice. In addition, research on TDR is science and process centred. The benefits of TDR in addressing real-world problems within the field of land use remain unproven.

One of the consequences of this restructuring is the establishment of a new relationship between the Ministry of Health (MS) and the Ministry of Education (MEC) regarding the funding of Federal University Hospitals. The Brazilian Ministry of Health has implemented a certification process for the University Hospitals that requires meeting a set of financial, managerial, and educational processes related goals, and adoption of an assistance model. This article uses the MultiCriteria Decision Aid (MCDA) approach to support the development of a model that can help the university hospitals’ managers assess their institutional performance to meet their joint goals with the MS/MEC and obtain the certification. This case study was conducted at a hospital within the Brazilian federal education network.

AB  - The new EU strategy on adaptation to climate change suggests flexible and participatory approaches. Face-to-face contact, although it involves time-consuming procedures with a limited audience, has often been considered the most effective participatory approach. In recent years, however, there has been an increase in the visibility of different citizens' initiatives in the online world, which strengthens the possibility of greater citizen agency. This paper investigates whether the Internet can ensure efficient public participation with meaningful engagement in climate change adaptation. In elucidating issues regarding climate change adaptation, we developed an eParticipation framework to explore adaptation capacity of agriculture to climate change in Northern Italy. Farmers were mobilised using a pre-existing online network. First they took part in an online questionnaire for revealing their perceptions of and reactions to the impacts of ongoing changes in agriculture. We used these results to suggest a portfolio of policy measures and to set evaluation criteria. Farmers then evaluated these policy options, using a multi criteria analysis tool with a simple user-friendly interface. Our results showed that eParticipation is efficient: it supports a rapid data collection, while involving high number of participants. Moreover, we demonstrated that the digital divide is decreasingly an obstacle for using online spaces for public engagement. This research does not present eParticipation as a panacea. Rather, eParticipation was implemented with well-established participatory approaches to both validate the results and, consequently, communicate meaningful messages on local agricultural adaptation practices to regional decision-makers. Feedbacks from the regional decision-makers showed their interest in using eParticipation to improve communication with farmers in the future. We expect that, with further Internet proliferation, eParticipation may allow the inclusion of more representative samples, which would contribute to an informed and legitimate decision-making process.

AB  - Background
Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) enable users to interact with their environment using only cognitive activities. This paper presents the results of a comparison of four methodological frameworks used to select a pair of tasks to control a binary NIRS-BCI; specifically, three novel personalized task paradigms and the state-of-the-art prescribed task framework were explored.
New methods
Three types of personalized task selection approaches were compared, including: user-selected mental tasks using weighted slope scores (WS-scores), user-selected mental tasks using pair-wise accuracy rankings (PWAR), and researcher-selected mental tasks using PWAR. These paradigms, along with the state-of-the-art prescribed mental task framework, where mental tasks are selected based on the most commonly used tasks in literature, were tested by ten able-bodied participants who took part in five NIRS-BCI sessions.
Results
The frameworks were compared in terms of their accuracy, perceived ease-of-use, computational time, user preference, and length of training. Most notably, researcher-selected personalized tasks resulted in significantly higher accuracies, while user-selected personalized tasks resulted in significantly higher perceived ease-of-use. It was also concluded that PWAR minimized the amount of data that needed to be collected; while, WS-scores maximized user satisfaction and minimized computational time.
Comparison with existing method
In comparison to the state-of-the-art prescribed mental tasks, our findings show that overall, personalized tasks appear to be superior to prescribed tasks with respect to accuracy and perceived ease-of-use.
Conclusions
The deployment of personalized rather than prescribed mental tasks ought to be considered and further investigated in future NIRS-BCI studies.

AB  - Background
The objective of this literature review was to identify barriers to access and use of high cost medicines (HCMs).
Method
A literature review was performed in common electronic databases (Medline, PubMed, Springer Link, Embase, Science Direct, and Google Scholar). We identified original studies published between 1999 and 2011 relating to access to and use of HCMs. Three hundred and seventy four relevant articles were found. Forty-three original articles matched inclusion criteria.
Results
We categorized access barriers into three levels: health system, regional/hospital, and patient levels. Barriers to access included the affordability of the healthcare system, the decision-making process for funding HCMs and eligibility criteria for access, geographic variation in funding and access, communication between physicians and patients, and patient out of pocket costs.
Conclusion
Barriers to access HCMs are inter-related. These barriers are also relevant for other medicines but are escalated in the case of HCMs. Overall, healthcare systems are facing barriers related to high out-of-pocket cost for patients and/or barriers regarding the decision-making process and the effects of reimbursement decisions (i.e., restricted, delayed or denied access, particularly the latter for socialized systems with a universal coverage scheme). Inadequate access to HCMs may lead to subsequent use of unnecessary medical treatments. Barriers to access HCMs can also lead to treatment disparities between patients who can overcome these barriers and those who cannot. Improvements in the decision-making process can increase acceptance of the need to prioritize access to HCMs.

KW  - 2-strokes Diesel engine

KW  - multi-objective optimization
AB  - One of the factors limiting the utilization of piston internal combustion engines for aircraft propulsion is the performance decrease increasing the altitude of operation. This is due to the negative effect of air density reduction increasing the altitude on cylinder filling. A solution to this problem is represented by the engine supercharging. Unfortunately, in two stroke engines, the cylinder filling efficiency is antithetical to the cylinder scavenging efficiency. With the aim of guaranteeing an optimal balance between engine performance and specific consumption, an engine breathing system optimization is needed. In this work, the results obtained running a multi-objective optimization procedure aiming at performance increase and fuel consumption reduction of an aircraft two stroke supercharged diesel engine at various altitudes are analyzed. During the optimization procedure, several geometric parameters of the intake and exhaust systems as well as geometric and operating engine parameters have been varied. Then, a multi-objective optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithms has been run to obtain the configurations optimizing the engine performance at Sea Level (take-off conditions) and fuel consumption at 10680 m (cruise conditions).

The approach is explicitly selective to address multicollinearity trap due to the subjectivity in selecting energy variables by considering cost-accuracy trade-off. It objectively weights the relative importance of individual pertinent efficiency measuring criteria using either multiple linear regression or principal component analysis contingent on meta data quality. Through this approach, building energy performance is comprehensively evaluated and optimized. Simultaneously, the significant challenges associated with conventional single-criterion benchmarking models can be avoided. Together with a clustering algorithm on a three-year panel dataset, the benchmarking case of 324 single-family dwellings demonstrated an improved robustness of the presented multi-criteria benchmarking approach over the conventional single-criterion ones.

This study presents a new model, called the Electric Vehicles Regional Optimizer, to model this uncertainty and predict the optimal combination of drivetrains in different U.S. regions for the year 2030. First, the life cycle cost and life cycle environmental emissions of internal combustion engine vehicles, gasoline hybrid electric vehicles, and three different Electric Vehicle types (gasoline plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, gasoline extended range electric vehicle, and all-electric vehicle) are evaluated considering their inherent uncertainties. Then, the environmental damage costs and the water footprint of the studied drivetrains are estimated. Additionally, using an Exploratory Modeling and Analysis method, the uncertainties in the life cycle cost, environmental damage cost, and water footprint of studied vehicle types are modeled for different U.S. electricity grid regions. Finally, an optimization model is coupled with Exploratory Modeling and Analysis to find the ideal combination of different vehicle types in each U.S. region for the year 2030. The findings of this research will help policy makers and transportation planners to prepare our nation's transportation system for the influx of electric vehicles.

AB  - Rapidly increasing energy demand and growing concern about economic and environmental consequences call for renewable/sustainable energy technologies׳ adoption in India. Renewable/sustainable energy technologies have faced a number of constraints that have affected their rate of adoption. In this paper an attempt has been made to identify and rank the major barriers in the adoption of ‘renewable and green’ energy technologies in the Indian context. Twenty-eight barriers have been identified from an extensive literature review. These identified barriers have been categorized into seven dimensions of barriers, i.e. Economical & Financial; Market; Awareness & Information; Technical; Ecological and Geographical; Cultural & Behavioral; and Political & Government Issues. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique has been utilized for ranking of barriers to adopt renewable/sustainable technologies in the Indian context. All pair comparisons in AHP have been made based on experts’ opinions (selected from academia and industry). Sensitivity analysis has also been made to investigate the priority ranking stability of barriers to adopt renewable/sustainable technologies in the Indian context. This paper may help practitioners, regulators and academician focus their future efforts in adoption of ‘renewable/sustainable energy technologies’ in India. Further, this understanding may be helpful in framing the policies and strategies towards adoption of renewable/sustainable energy technologies.

AB  - Human activities and climate change are key factors impacting ecosystem functions and its goods and services, which are important to the livelihoods of mountain communities. In Nepal, community based ecosystem management has been widely adopted as a way to secure local management and empowerment, but local knowledge, perceptions and values of ecosystem change and services are often ignored, and perhaps inadequately understood, in decision-making processes at district or national level. Our objective therefore was to develop a multi-method approach to support mapping of ecosystem services and assessing their local values. Local perceptions of ecosystem use, change and values were identified using participatory mapping, key informant and focus group discussions, and an extensive household survey carried out in the upstream Koshi River basin. Results were cross-validated with scientific literature, statistics and remote sensing data. Key ecosystem services identified are water, agricultural produce, and various forest products, most of which show a declining trend. We demonstrate that the use of different methods and levels of input results in different and complementary types of insights and detail needed for balanced and informed decision-making regarding sustainable management of ESs to secure current and future livelihoods and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Vague sets were first proposed by Gau and Buehrer [11] as an extension of fuzzy sets which encompass fuzzy sets, inter-valued fuzzy sets, as special cases. Vague sets consist of two parts, that is, the membership function and nonmembership function. Therefore, in accordance with practical demand these sets are more flexible than the existing fuzzy sets and provide much more information about the situation. In this paper, a new approach for the ranking of trapezoidal vague sets is introduced. Shortcomings in some existing ranking approaches have been pointed out. Validation of the proposed ranking method has been established through the reasonable properties of the fuzzy quantities. Further, the proposed ranking approach is applied to develop a new method for dealing with vague risk analysis problems to find the probability of failure, of each component of compressor system, which could be used for managerial decision making and future system maintenance strategy. Also, the proposed method provides a useful way for handling vague risk analysis problems.

AB  - A trusted service manager (TSM) mediates between service providers, mobile network operators (MNOs), and the secure element (SE) issuer. As a facilitator to accelerate the development of the Near Field Communication (NFC) application ecosystem, such as mobile payments, e-tickets, etc., the TSM and its issues have received increased attention in recent years. In this study, the TSM development modes are analyzed under the challenges of mobile operating system designers (OSD) by an analytical network process. The research framework for developing a TSM is constructed by four main criteria and twelve sub-criteria through a literature review. Based on the authors’ previous work, five possible developing modes of TSMs are set as alternatives. An analytic network process (ANP) framework is proposed, and expert questionnaires are designed. Eighteen experts in NFC-related domains, including MNO, bank, smart card, and TSM stakeholders, were interviewed, and a proper developing mode for TSM in Taiwan was obtained. All these experts are in businesses related with TSM or are familiar with the TSM ecosystem. The analytical results not only include the ranks of four main criteria and twelve sub-criteria but also reveal that experts expect “Cooperation mode” to be the best alternative for developing a TSM in Taiwan. The explanations for the ranks are discussed with the current NFC ecosystem in Taiwan. The research framework for developing a TSM in this study is also expected to be applied to different countries, as developing modes of a TSM are generally multiple-criteria decision-making issues. Developing modes of a TSM for other countries could be implemented by changing the criteria, sub-criteria and alternatives of this research structure according to a country’s own political, NFC-related business environment or development stage of the NFC industry. In conclusion, this study provides academic and managerial implications of the results showing why “Cooperation mode” could be the best alternative to develop a TSM in Taiwan. This study’s contributions are as follows. First, an ANP network of TSM development is constructed, and it can be applied to other countries with similar developing mode analysis processes. Second, a proper developing mode of a TSM in Taiwan based on the views of different experts is uncovered.

AB  - The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a swarm-based optimization technique proposed for solving continuous optimization problems. The artificial agents of the ABC algorithm use one solution update rule during the search process. To efficiently solve optimization problems with different characteristics, we propose the integration of multiple solution update rules with ABC in this study. The proposed method uses five search strategies and counters to update the solutions. During initialization, each update rule has a constant counter content. During the search process performed by the artificial agents, these counters are used to determine the rule that is selected by the bees. Because the optimization problems and functions have different characteristics, one or more search strategies are selected and are used during the iterations according to the characteristics of the numeric functions in the proposed approach. By using the search strategies and mechanisms proposed in the present study, the artificial agents learn which update rule is more appropriate based on the characteristics of the problem to find better solutions. The performance and accuracy of the proposed method are examined on 28 numerical benchmark functions, and the obtained results are compared with various classical versions of ABC and other nature-inspired optimization algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, integrated and improved with search strategies, outperforms the basic variants and other variants of the ABC algorithm and other methods in terms of solution quality and robustness for most of the experiments.

AB  - The emergent field of green supply chain management has been rapidly evolving with a geometric growth in the number of academic publications in this field. A number of literature reviews have been published focusing on specific aspects of green supply chain management such as performance measurement, supplier selection/evaluation, analytical modeling efforts, and some others with broader areas of focus. This paper presents a thorough bibliometric and network analysis that provides insights not previously fully grasped or evaluated by other reviews on this topic. The analysis begins by identifying over 1000 published studies, which are then distilled down to works of proven influence and those authored by influential investigators. Using rigorous bibliometric tools, established and emergent research clusters are identified for topological analysis, identification of key research topics, interrelations, and collaboration patterns. This systematic mapping of the field helps graphically illustrate the publications evolution over time and identify areas of current research interests and potential directions for future research. The findings provide a robust roadmap for further investigation in this field.

AB  - Due to the limited range and long charging time for electric vehicles, proper utilization of the stored battery energy is crucial. Current methods for electric vehicle range estimation do not help the driver to formulate a driving strategy based on trip parameters (e.g., trip speed) related to power savings. This can be done by predicting the driving range based on optimal trip parameters prior to the trip enabling the driver to formulate a suitable driving strategy. This study proposes a novel strategy that presents a number of optimal trip speeds to the driver, along with the total trip time corresponding to a predicted range. The optimal speeds were obtained by solving a multi-objective optimization problem that maximized electric motor efficiency and minimized power consumption. Two approaches to calculate the objective functions were considered: using constant battery voltage and using battery voltage as a function of the state-of-charge. Pareto-optimal fronts were obtained and a plot of the predicted range and trip times for optimal speeds was created. It was found that the shape of the fronts was not affected by the approach; however, the range was overestimated when a constant battery voltage was used.

AB  - As supply chain risk management has transitioned from an emerging topic to a growing research area, there is a need to classify different types of research and examine the general trends of this research area. This helps identify fertile research streams with great potential for further examination. This paper presents a systematic review of the quantitative and analytical models (i.e. mathematical, optimization and simulation modeling efforts) for managing supply chain risks. We use bibliometric and network analysis tools to generate insights that have not been captured in the previous reviews on the topic. In particular, we complete a systemic mapping of the literature that identifies the key research clusters/topics, interrelationships, and generative research areas that have provided the field with the foundational knowledge, concepts, theories, tools, and techniques. Some of our findings include (1) quantitative analysis of supply chain risk is expanding rapidly; (2) European journals are the more popular research outlets for the dissemination of the knowledge developed by researchers in United States and Asia; and (3) sustainability risk analysis is an emerging and fast evolving research topic.

AB  - As cloud computing evolves, it is becoming more and more apparent that the future of this industry lies in interconnected cloud systems where resources will be provided by multiple “Cloud” providers instead of just one. In this way, the hosts of services that are cloud-based will have access to even larger resource pools while at the same time increasing their scalability and availability by diversifying both their computing resources and the geographical locations where those resources operate from. Furthermore the increased competition between the cloud providers in conjunction with the commoditization of hardware has already led to large decreases in the cost of cloud computing and this trend is bound to continue in the future. Scientific focus in cloud computing is also headed this way with more studies on the efficient allocation of resources and effective distribution of computing tasks between those resources. This study evaluates the use of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms in the scheduling of bag-of-tasks applications in a heterogeneous cloud of clouds. The study of both local and globally arriving jobs has been considered along with the introduction of sporadically arriving critical jobs. Simulation results show that the use of these meta-heuristics can provide significant benefits in costs and performance.

AB  - Nowadays, software systems are complex and large. To cope with this situation, teams of developers have to cooperate and work in parallel on software models. Thus, techniques to support the collaborative development of models are a must. To this end, several approaches exist to identify the change operations applied in parallel, to detect conflicts among them, as well as to construct a merged model by incorporating all non-conflicting operations. Conflicts often denote situations where the application of one operation disables the applicability of another one. Consequently, one operation has to be omitted to construct a valid merged model in such scenarios. When having to decide which operation to omit, the importance of its application has to be taken into account depending on the operation type and the application context. However, existing works treat the operations to merge with equal importance. We introduce in this paper, for the first time, a multi-objective formulation of the problem of model merging, based on NSGA-II, that aims to find the best trade-off between minimizing the number of omitted operations and maximizing the number of successfully applied important operations. We evaluated our approach using seven open source systems and compared it with different existing model merging approaches. The merging solutions obtained with our approach were found in all of the scenarios of our experiments to be comparable in terms of minimizing the number of conflicts to those suggested by existing approaches and to carry a high importance score of merged operations. Our results also revealed an interesting feature concerning the trade-off between the two conflicting objectives that demonstrates the practical value of taking the importance of operations into account in model merging tasks. In fact, the shape of the Pareto front represents an interesting guidance for developers to select best solutions based on their preferences.

AB  - Many urban areas lack in quality of urban condition, thus affecting the quality of life of urban dwellers. Great efforts are made to develop new strategies for transforming existing urban patterns toward higher quality, which is related to socio-economic, environmental, transportation, and other factors. The analysis of possible transformations further requires considering their effects at a parcel scale up to the city region. This is important, because gaining in one quality at a local scale, e.g., housing supply, comes partly at the expense of other qualities, such as the availability of open space, affecting recreation amenities at a regional scale. However, an approach for the assessment of the urban condition's quality across multiple aspects and scales is not yet available. We demonstrate an indicator-based behavioral modeling approach, which illustrates interactions and effects on and between different spatial scales. An urban development scenario was compared to the status quo to show the effects on different quality aspects. A set of indicators was calculated from the modeling results and mapped for the regional, district, and local scale. The cross-scale analysis of the selected indicators effectively points to areas where densification patterns cause, e.g., loss in their recreational quality and, thus, potentially a degradation of the quality of life of urban dwellers. The presented approach helps understanding the relationships between political interventions, urban patterns, and their impact on urban quality. The spatially explicit visualization of possible effects may support matching different spatial development policy objectives across the divergent targets of regional planning participants.

AB  - Recommender systems based on argumentation represent an important proposal where the recommendation is supported by qualitative information. In these systems, the role of the comparison criterion used to decide between competing arguments is paramount and the possibility of using the most appropriate for a given domain becomes a central issue; therefore, an argumentative recommender system that offers an interchangeable argument comparison criterion provides a significant ability that can be exploited by the user. However, in most of current recommender systems, the argument comparison criterion is either fixed, or codified within the arguments. In this work we propose a formalization of context-adaptable selection criteria that enhances the argumentative reasoning mechanism. Thus, we do not propose of a new type of recommender system; instead we present a mechanism that expand the capabilities of existing argumentation-based recommender systems. More precisely, our proposal is to provide a way of specifying how to select and use the most appropriate argument comparison criterion effecting the selection on the user’s preferences, giving the possibility of programming, by the use of conditional expressions, which argument preference criterion has to be used in each particular situation.

AB  - Multi-attribute resource allocation problems involve the allocation of resources on the basis of several attributes, therefore, the definition of a fairness method for this kind of auctions should be formulated from a multi-dimensional perspective. Under such point of view, fairness should take into account all the attributes involved in the allocation problem, since focusing on just a single attribute may compromise the allocations regarding the remainder attributes (e.g. incurring in delayed or bad quality tasks). In this paper, we present a multi-dimensional fairness approach based on priorities. For that purpose, a recurrent auction scenario is assumed, in which the auctioneer keeps track of winner and losers. From that information, the priority methods are defined based on the lost auctions number, the number of consecutive loses, and the fitness of their loser bids. Moreover, some methods contain a probabilistic parameter that enables handling wealth ranking disorders due to fairness. We test our approach in real-data based simulator which emulates an industrial production environment where several resource providers compete to perform different tasks. The results pointed that multi-dimensional fairness incentives agents to remain in the market whilst it improves the equity of the wealth distribution without compromising the quality of the allocation attributes.

AB  - Contemporary advancements in Information Technology and the efforts from various research initiatives in the AEC industry are showing evidence of progress with the emergence of building information modelling (BIM). BIM presents the opportunity of electronically modelling and managing the vast amount of information embedded in a building project, from its conception to end-of-life. Researchers have been looking at extensions to expand its scope. Sustainability is one such modelling extension that is in need of development. This is becoming pertinent for the structural engineer as recent design criteria have put great emphasis on the sustainability credentials in addition to the traditional criteria of structural integrity, constructability and cost. With the complexity of designs, there are now needs to provide decision support tools to aid in the assessment of the sustainability credentials of design solutions. Such tools would be most beneficial at the conceptual design stage so that sustainability is built into the design solution starting from its inception. The sustainability of buildings is related to life cycle and is measured using indicator-terms such as life cycle costing, ecological footprint and carbon footprint. This paper proposes a modelling framework combining these three indicators in providing sustainability assessments of alternative design solutions based on the economic and environmental sustainability pillars. It employs the principles of feature-based modelling to extract construction-specific information from product models for the purposes of sustainability analysis. A prototype system is implemented using .NET and linked to the BIM enabled software, Revit Structures™. The system appraises alternative design solutions using multi-criteria performance analysis. This work demonstrates that current process and data modelling techniques can be employed to model sustainability related information to inform decisions right from the early stages of structural design. It concludes that the utilized information modelling representations – in the form of a process model, implementation algorithms and object-based instantiations – can capture sustainability related information to inform decisions at the early stages of the structural design process.

Recognising this knowledge gap, we employed the systemic review approach to construct a framework of roles of SIA practitioners from literature. Our conceptual framework encompasses eleven roles, namely project manager of SIA, practitioner of SIA methodologies, social researcher, social strategy developer, social impact management consultant, community developer, visionary, public involvement specialist, coordinator, SIA researcher, and educator. Although these roles have been stratified into three overarching categories, the project, community and SIA development, they are indeed interrelated and should be examined together. The significance of this study is threefold. First, it pioneers the study of the roles of SIA practitioners in a focused and systematic manner. Second, it informs practitioners of the expectations of them thereby fostering professionalism. Third, it prepares the public for SIAs by elucidating the functions and values of the assessment.

AB  - As governments embark on public–private partnerships (PPPs) to develop their water infrastructure, effective risk assessment, which has remained nebulous, has become an important step to ensure success of these projects. This paper investigates the risk factors and assesses the risk level of PPP water supply projects in developing countries using fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) approach. A 40-factor risk list was established through investigation in water projects cases and related literature and an industry-wide questionnaire survey with industry practitioners. Initial statistical analysis yielded 22 critical risk factors that would have significant impacts on water supply partnerships. These factors were categorized into three principal factors (financial/commercial, legal and socio-political, and technical) forming the input variables for FSE analysis. The study showed that the overall risk level of water PPPs in developing countries is high, suggesting that these projects are risky to both governments and private participants. The fuzzy analysis, overall, confirmed that financial/commercial risk category is the most critical principal factor, followed by legal and socio-political category and technical category. The FSE approach to risk assessment can be used as an initial screening to establish risk factors that require attention of management and further detailed analysis. This study demonstrates that FSE methodology can be used to synthetically analyze local conditions in a country prior to setting up the project structure and normal due diligence. It is a multi-attribute risk assessment framework and may serve as a risk evaluation tool for private investors, policy-makers and decision-makers.

AB  - In designing a supply chain (SC) system, the problem arises when a company has unsatisfactory inventory control policy and material routing between supplier–producer and distributor in SC considering specified cost and demand. The integration of decisions of different functions into a single optimization model is the base of this research. The aim of this paper is to study and compare the existing models of supply, production and distribution in SC and propose a model which integrates mentioned criteria in supply chain management (SCM). Furthermore, it proposes a new method for calculation of fitness function in genetic algorithm (GA) process. The successful designing of this model has led us to explore the use of heuristic methods such as GA to quantify the flow of SC, information and material flow. At first, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) is adapted to evaluate objective function weights in SC. Then final weights of objective function are determined by the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). This research also simulated the real company SC operations, and determines the most effective strategic and operational policies for an effective SC system. The result obtained from the model shows that it is robust. This model can also be applied to other industrial environments with slight modifications.

AB  - Conventional agricultural practices have often been associated with negative externalities, such as land degradation, pollution of soil and water resources, loss of biodiversity, and decreased provision of ecosystem services (ES). In response to these negative effects, the number of indicator-based attempts to assess ES provided by land use systems has increased. However, decisions regarding the importance of the different ES are usually made subjectively. Following an objective approach through the use of a partial order ranking method, this study aimed to assess several non-provisioning ES supplied by alley cropping system (ACS) in comparison with conventional agriculture (CA). The main objective of the study was to verify the applicability of partial order ranking to an ecologically-based assessment, focusing on soil, water, and biodiversity indicators. Results from 40 hypothetical scenarios representing various site conditions of agricultural fields in Germany were calculated using the Ecosystem Services Assessment Tool for Agroforestry (ESAT-A), a toolbox designed to assess selected ES of ACS following an empirical approach. The results were ranked using partial order and were visualized by a Hasse diagram. The findings depict partial order ranking as a promising technique to support decision making in order to find priority scenarios and indicators where the provision of ES can be enhanced by establishing ACS. The minimal scenarios under CA identified with simultaneously low values of all indicators were perceived as target scenarios for establishing ACS. The values of the indicators for the current land use system need to be taken into account in order to avoid scenarios where high tradeoff was suggested. Additionally, this approach can be extended and utilized at the field level to aid farmer decisions on which land use strategy is the most suitable alternative to increase the provision of ES.

AB  - In the 1990s, the industrial application of high-speed machining achieved enormous success because of its favorable characteristics such as high productivity, better work quality, and ease of machining thin-walled structures. With fast changing emphasis of the world's manufacturing sector towards environmental benignity, the issue of sustainability with regard to application of high-speed machining becomes pivotal. The article presents an experimental investigation regarding comparison of conventional machining and high-speed machining with respect to sustainability measures. A set of 64 grooving experiments was performed on two tempers each of a high-strength low-alloy steel and a heat treatable titanium alloy. The experimental design focused on studying the effects of cutting mode (conventional/high-speed machining), cutting speed levels for each of the two modes, feed rate, and minimum quantity lubrication on tool life, specific cutting energy, productivity, process cost, and machining forces. It was found that the choice between the two machining modes is highly sensitive with respect to manufacturing sustainability. The conventional machining mode was found to be comparatively economical, while the high-speed machining mode significantly outperformed the other in terms of low specific energy consumption and high productivity. The article asserts that high speed machining can completely surpass conventional machining as the sustainable way of metal cutting if the ways could be found to curb excessive tool damage observable at high cutting speeds.

AB  - Assembly sequence planning (ASP) is the process of computing a sequence of assembly motions for constituent parts of an assembled final product. ASP is proven to be NP-hard and thus its effective and efficient solution has been a challenge for the researchers in the field. Despite the fact that most assembled products like ships, aircrafts and automobiles are composed of rigid and flexible parts, no work exists for assembly/disassembly sequence planning of flexible parts. This paper lays out a theoretical ground for modeling the deformability of flexible assembly parts by introducing the concept of Assembly stress matrix (ASM) to describe interference relations between parts of an assembly and the amount of compressive stress needed for assembling flexible parts. Also, the Scatter Search (SS) optimization algorithm is customized for this problem to produce high-quality solutions by simultaneously minimizing both the maximum applied stress exerted for performing assembly operations and the number of assembly direction changes. The parameters of this algorithm are tuned by a TOPSIS-Taguchi based tuning method. A number of ASP problems with rigid and flexible parts were solved by the presented SS and other algorithms like Genetic and Memetic algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Breakout Local Search, Iterated Local Search, and Multistart Local Search, and the results and their in-depth statistical analyses showed that the SS outperformed other algorithms by producing the best-known or optimal solutions with highest success rates.

AB  - Supply chain agility is a key determinant of competitiveness in today’s dynamic and turbulent business environment. This paper develops a practical evaluation framework that serves to identify critical factors for achieving supply chain agility. First, we construct a reference framework of the factors that contribute to achieving agility in supply chain based on a systematic analysis of the related literature. Then, we develop a hybrid evaluation method that integrates fuzzy logic, DEMATEL (decision making trial and evaluation laboratory), and ANP (analytic network process). The proposed framework is implemented in an automotive company that is seeking to improve agility of its supply chain. It provides a systematic approach to explore and analyze influential relationships between agile-enabling factors and assigns a weight to each factor representing its relative importance. It also captures ambiguities, uncertainties, and vagueness inherent in evaluating the factors and their relationships and provides an efficient mechanism for group evaluation.

AB  - Fishery management is increasingly moving toward management that accounts for environmental and social dimensions. Such an approach requires the integration of natural and social science information into planning and decision-making processes. The actual integration of social science information, however, remains limited in many policy and decision-making processes within fisheries. Our study provides insights into factors that influence the intention to use social science information among fishery managers and the actual integration of such information into fishery management. Based on interviews with fishery managers in the Great Lakes, we find that the lack of social science expertise in fishery management agencies leads to multiple negative beliefs and attitudes, and subsequently a low intention to use social science information in decision-making processes. At the same time, the paper finds that more expertise in decision-making tools and basing social science on equal footing with natural sciences within fishery management institutions appears critical to advance the actual integration of social science information in fishery management.

AB  - Water distribution systems are aging and deteriorating over time. Deterioration of water mains causes reduction in the structural capacity and the hydraulic capacity of the water distribution systems. Municipalities face the greatest challenges to define the deterioration processes and the factors that can affect the rate of deterioration. To face these challenges municipalities need to define methodologies and technologies for water distribution systems planning, design, construction, management, assessment and rehabilitation, that consider local economic, environmental and social factors. Therefore, it is important to implement mitigation measures in a timely manner to extend the useful service life of water distribution systems. This paper presents a model that prioritizes the rehabilitation of water mains as well as assists in rehabilitation technology selection. A series of interviews and questionnaire surveys are conducted to identify the most important factors that affect water mains deterioration and selection of the rehabilitation technology. The weighted factors scoring model is carried out using the Simos’ procedure to develop the priority index model and the alternative evaluation model. The priority index model is integrated with the Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to visualize the condition severity of the water pipes to help the decision maker to decide the course of action. A case study of water mains sample of a set of the collected data for this research has been used to implement the proposed model.

AB  - Optimal supply chain design is vital to the success of industrial concerns now more than ever before. This paper reviews some principal research opportunities and challenges in the field of supply chain design. The growing area of enterprise-wide optimization and the increasing importance of energy and sustainability issues provide plentiful opportunities for supply chain design research. However, modeling, algorithmic, and computational challenges arise from these research opportunities. There are three major technical challenge areas where knowledge gaps can be addressed in supply chain design, namely multi-scale challenges, multi-objective and sustainability challenges, and multi-player challenges. This paper provides an overview of opportunity areas, a description of relevant technical challenges, and a perspective on how these challenges might be addressed in supply chain design. Illustrative examples are presented to illuminate avenues for future research.

AB  - Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely used in handling various water resource optimization problems in recent years. However, it is still challenging for EAs to identify near-optimal solutions for realistic problems within the available computational budgets. This paper introduces a novel multi-objective optimization method to improve the efficiency of a typically difficult water resource problem: water distribution network (WDN) design. In the proposed approach, a WDN is decomposed into different sub-networks using decomposition techniques. EAs optimize these sub-networks individually, generating Pareto fronts for each sub-network with great efficiency. A propagation method is proposed to evolve Pareto fronts of the sub-networks towards the Pareto front for the full network while eliminating the need to hydraulically simulate the intact network itself. Results from two complex realistic WDNs show that the proposed approach is able to find better fronts than conventional full-search algorithms (optimize the entire network without decomposition) with dramatically improved efficiency.

AB  - A farmland environmental quality assessment and prediction system was developed based on the database technology, WebGIS and model theory to provide intuitional information of farmland environmental pollution situation and the pollution trend for scientific decision making regarding monitoring soil quality. The designed system could be used for the query of agricultural environmental information, assessment of farmland environmental quality, and forecasting of farmland environmental pollution. An environmental quality assessment model was developed and integrated in the system by single factor index and weighted pollutant index method. The application of the assessment model showed that the single factor index of soil heavy metal Hg in the study area reached light pollution levels. The pollutant area occupied 21.3% of the entire study area. The other five soil heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Cd, Cr, and As) were in safe levels of soil environmental quality assessment classification standard. The average weighted pollutant index was 0.54, indicating good soil environmental quality. Most parts of the region was in safe level. An exponential smoothing forecasting model was established based on the time series characteristics of the heavy metal pollution in the agricultural producing area to predict heavy metal pollution. The analytical results showed that the prediction accuracy of the models was approximately 90%, indicating that the exponential smoothing model can fit the variation of heavy metal pollution.

AB  - This study aims to systematically review the cross disciplinary literature covering the time period from 1934 to January 2013 on behavioral operations in supply chain in order to identify and define the taxonomy of the research on power influences in supply chain. A list of noted journals and search results from Science Direct and Web of Knowledge, IEEE Xplore, and INFORMS (approximately 11,000 journal articles) is used to prepare content collection. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is applied as the review and knowledge extraction methodology. Using the text analysis and mining method we can combine statistical methods and expert human judgment to extract knowledge in the form of key latent factors. The LSA based analysis gives the study a scientific grounding which helps to overcome the subjectivity of collective opinion about the trends. This approach allows proposing taxonomy of the research on power influences in supply chain. The adopted systems approach is used to find research gaps in each class of taxonomy. An emerging trend is noticed in the research of behavioral operations in supply chain. Understanding such a scholarly structure and future trends will assist researchers to assimilate the divergent developments of this multidisciplinary research in one place. This review will be beneficial for practitioners as they consider behavioral aspects in decision making. We have also studied articles related to supply chain published in Expert Systems with Applications (ESWA) journal. We have speculated what an ESWA-related community would like to see in future publications. This will encourage researchers to explore the recommended areas and publish to these outlets.

AB  - The concept of sensing-as-a-service is proposed to enable a unified way of accessing and controlling sensing devices for many Internet of Things based applications. Existing techniques for Web service computing are not sufficient for this class of services that are exposed by resource-constrained devices. The vast number of distributed and redundantly deployed sensors necessitate specialised techniques for their discovery and ranking. Current research in this line mostly focuses on discovery, e.g., designing efficient searching methods by exploiting the geographical properties of sensing devices. The problem of ranking, which aims to prioritise semantically equivalent sensor services returned by the discovery process, has not been adequately studied. Existing methods mostly leverage the information directly associated with sensor services, such as detailed service descriptions or quality of service information. However, assuming the availability of such information for sensor services is often unrealistic. We propose a ranking strategy by estimating the cost of accessing sensor services. The computation is based on properties of the sensor nodes as well as the relevant contextual information extracted from the service access process. The evaluation results demonstrate not only the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of ranking quality measure, but also the potential for preserving the energy of the sensor nodes.

The rankings of these indicators indicate that the public participation and service quality of these e-government websites were highly consistent. In other words, the greater the public participation, the better the appraisals of service quality, and vice versa. However, the comprehensive performance analyses indicate that only 4 of the 16 e-government websites performed at the efficient frontier, while the remainder were inefficient. Therefore, e-government operations in the Anhui province must be improved to achieve efficiency.

KW  - Motion-pose geometric descriptor
AB  - In this paper, we present a novel view-invariant, motion-pose geometric descriptor (MPGD) as a human–human interaction representation to capture the semantic meaning of body-parts between two interacting humans. The proposed MPGD representation is based on utilizing the concept of anatomical planes to construct a motion profile and a pose profile for each human. Those two profiles are then concatenated to form a descriptor for the two interacting humans. Using the proposed MPGD representation, we study two problems related to human–human interaction analysis, namely human–human interaction classification and prediction. For the human–human interaction classification problem, we propose a hierarchical classification framework consisting of a representation layer and three classification layers. The classification framework aims to realize what is the performed interaction in an input video by understanding how and when each individual performed sub-activities to each other over time. The human–human interaction prediction problem aims to predict the class of ongoing human–human interaction at its early stages. To do so, we propose a prediction framework that utilizes the proposed MPGD to construct an accumulated histograms-based representation for an ongoing interaction. The accumulated histograms of MPGDs are then used to train a set of support-vector-machine classifiers with a probabilistic output to predict the class of an ongoing interaction. In order to evaluate our proposed MPGD representation and both the classification and the prediction frameworks, we utilize a Microsoft Kinect sensor to capture human–human interactions in a video dataset that consists of 12 interactions performed by 12 individuals. We evaluate the performance of our proposed classification framework and compare the results with an appearance-based representation and a representation that combines both the MPGD representation and the appearance-based representation. On the one hand, our proposed MPGD representation performance has shown promising results compared to the appearance-based representation with an average accuracy of 94.86% in classifying human–human interactions. On the other hand, human–human interaction prediction framework has achieved an average prediction accuracy of 82.46% with only 50% of the interaction video being observed.

AB  - This study focuses on the development of a methodological framework for the design of a five-echelon hydrogen supply chain (HSC) (energy source, production, storage, transportation and fuelling station) considering the geographic level of implementation. The formulation based on mixed integer linear programming involves a multi-criteria approach where three objectives have to be optimised simultaneously, i.e., cost, global warming potential and safety risk. The objective is twofold: first, to test the robustness of the method proposed in De-Leon (2014) from a regional to a national geographic scale and, secondly, to examine the consistency of the results. A new phase of data collection and demand scenarios are performed to be adapted to the French case based on the analysis of roadmaps. In this case study, the ArcGIS® spatial tool is used to locate the supply chain elements before and after optimisation. The multi-objective optimisation approach by the ɛ-constraint method is applied, analysed and discussed. Finally, a comparison between the results of different geographic scale cases is carried out.

KW  - Decision making
AB  - Megaprojects are complex and expensive projects that often involve social, technical, economic, environmental and political (STEEP) challenges to project management. Despite these challenges, project owners and financiers continue to invest large sums of money in megaprojects that run high risks of being over schedule and over budget. While some degree of cost and schedule risks are considered during project planning, the challenge of modelling risks interactions and impacts on project performance still remains. To tackle this technical problem, this research adopted the Analytical Network Process and combined it with a new Risk Priority Index as an innovative approach to model risks analytically based on data collected from the Edinburgh Tram Network project at the construction phase. The approach provides an interactive way for developers to prioritise risks across the project supply network and to initiate timely mitigation strategies against significant cost and time consequences of STEEP risks on megaproject performance.

AB  - This paper provides an extensive review of anaerobic digestion (AD) systems, with a specific focus on community scale digesters for urban applications, processing either municipal organic waste exclusively or as mix feed. Emphasis is placed on reducing the systems scale environmental impact of AD technologies, including pre- and post-treatment stages, alongside biogas production. Developments to-date in AD system research in Europe and in the Asia region have been compared, providing a comprehensive evaluation of current practice, elucidating the areas of further potentials. The scope of this review is two-fold—one, covering AD technologies including a cohort of simple and integrated wet and dry systems, which can be operated as continuous flow designs in single- or multi-stages. Two, focusing more on practices in digestate handling that minimise environmental impacts arising from their storage and land application. From an environmental perspective, we note the following trends emerging in the literature for processing urban waste that need further exploitation: dry AD (60–85% moisture) is suitable for low organic loads, mainly owing to resource savings in terms of water usage; co-digestion has shown better buffering capability, especially for two-stage digestion of food-based feed stocks; separating the digestate into liquid/solid fractions is effective for handling post-digestion emissions, mainly for mitigating ammonia volatilisation to air and phosphate leaching to soil. We report responses to a survey, conducted for this review, highlighting the contemporary issues and challenges—with particular focus on the operational, social and management issues from an Indian perspective. There is need for follow-up of running plants to ensure their environmental performance. Such initiatives will have to consider managing of pollution footprints from AD, alongside the current drive for its widespread implementation for two incentives: greenhouse gas mitigation and fossil-fuel independence.

AB  - This study provides insights into e-lifestyle of Internet users and their avoidance of Internet advertising. Determining the type of avoidance of each e-lifestyle aids the development of strategies for designing and publishing advertisements on the Internet, so that their effectiveness is enhanced and the negative trend of clicks on Internet advertisements is reduced. A survey was conducted with a group of 412 participants. The data were analysed through structural equation modelling (SEM) and multiple regression analysis both before and after adjusting the data by introducing the effect of average hours of Internet use on participant responses. The results obtained by analysing the main data reveal that e-lifestyle does not have a significant effect on Internet advertising avoidance (IAA). However, analysis of the modified data does indicate a significant effect. Also, in the analysis of the main and modified data, the type of avoidance from Internet advertising (cognitive, affective, and behavioural) varies according to each e-lifestyle. To the authors' belief the present study is the first reporting an investigation of the effect of e-lifestyle on avoidance of Internet advertising adjusted by average hours spent online.

AB  - Degradation of environment can significantly affect human existence and development. Therefore, environmental protection deserves significant attention. Low-carbon products have become an attractive option due to global warming. To efficiently and effectively achieve the aim of eco-friendly electronic product design, this paper develops a decision-making methodology for low-carbon electronic product design. First, the proposed methodology estimates the released amounts of greenhouse gases for different product designs throughout the major phases of a product's life cycle. This research can subsequently determine the benchmarking low-carbon design parts (as compared with other competitive products) and discern the causes of the poor carbon footprint (CF) performance. This will stimulate innovation to propose the low-carbon design alternatives. This research creates an evaluation model of low-carbon design alternative combinations in order to assess their performance. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is employed to determine an optimal low-carbon design alternative combination satisfying the CF constraint of a new product and minimizing the design time and cost. Finally, this research utilizes an MP3 player as a case study to showcase the significant efficacy of the proposed methodology.

AB  - Fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controllers are designed for load-frequency control (LFC) of two interconnected power systems. Conflicting time-domain design objectives are considered in a multi-objective optimization (MOO)-based design framework to design the gains and the fractional differ-integral orders of the FOPID controllers in the two areas. Here, we explore the effect of augmenting two different chaotic maps along with the uniform random number generator (RNG) in the popular MOO algorithm—the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Different measures of quality for MOO, e.g. hypervolume indicator, moment of inertia-based diversity metric, total Pareto spread, spacing metric, are adopted to select the best set of controller parameters from multiple runs of all the NSGA-II variants (i.e. nominal and chaotic versions). The chaotic versions of the NSGA-II algorithm are compared with the standard NSGA-II in terms of solution quality and computational time. In addition, the Pareto optimal fronts showing the trade-off between the two conflicting time domain design objectives are compared to show the advantage of using the FOPID controller over that with simple PID controller. The nature of fast/slow and high/low noise amplification effects of the FOPID structure or the four quadrant operation in the two inter-connected areas of the power system is also explored. A fuzzy logic-based method has been adopted next to select the best compromise solution from the best Pareto fronts corresponding to each MOO comparison criteria. The time-domain system responses are shown for the fuzzy best compromise solutions under nominal operating conditions. Comparative analysis on the merits and de-merits of each controller structure is reported then. A robustness analysis is also done for the PID and the FOPID controllers.

The TCCS can detect the conformity of the trains traveling along the tracks, and can transfer the status information to a main traffic control center. This paper proposes a methodological approach based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate the optimal locations to install a TCCS on a railway section. The eligibility and ranking of the potential sites have been defined with respect to constraints related to the rail line track layout and geometry, the TCCS technological features, and the required safety distance allowing the train to stop. The proposed approach has been applied to a real case study on the Italian railway.

First, considering the extensive manufacturing resource, a four-tuple model with use-cost, trading period, credibility and resource consumption for manufacturing resource clustering is proposed, as well as MRCO model associated with the four indicators. Then, an improved cluster-based genetic algorithm (CGA) has been carried out with a fuzzy c-means algorithm (FCM) for manufacturing resource clustering. The proposed algorithm uses a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to successfully determine the priority weights of multi-objective. Finally, a case study and comparison of performances with simple genetic algorithm (SGA) and non-cluster-based genetic algorithm (Non-CGA) are presented. Experimental results show the proposed method is more preferable in optimal solution searching and more efficient as the dimension of problem increases.

AB  - The pattern of forest land clearing in a region can be viewed as a gauge of sustainable (or unsustainable) use of agricultural and forest resources. In this study we examine the geographical distribution of land clearing potential in the Canadian agriculture–forestry interface and propose a new landscape-scale indicator that quantifies this potential. We consider the possibility that forested land will be cleared for agriculture as a trade-off between the land's capacity to support agriculture and its comparative value if it remains forested. However, this trade-off is complicated by the land's susceptibility to fragmentation (and subsequent conversion), which derives from the local pattern of forest, agriculture and other land cover types. We find the locations in the agriculture–forestry interface with the highest land clearing potential by delineating nested multi-attribute frontiers in the dimensions of the land's agricultural capacity, its estimated forest productivity and its fragmentation potential. The multi-attribute frontier concept addresses our lack of knowledge about the relative importance of these multiple drivers of land conversion by objectively combining them into a single-dimensional land clearing pressure metric in a geographical setting. Overall, our approach provides a simple yet informative indicator which reveals the geographical stratification of land clearing pressures across large regions. In general, the spatial delineation of areas with high land clearing potential agrees well with recent evidence of land clearing and deforestation events in Canada.

Due to the adaption, dynamic and multi-objective characteristics of complex water resources system, it is a considerable challenge to manage water resources in an efficient, equitable and sustainable way. An integrated optimal allocation model is proposed for complex adaptive system of water resources management. The model consists of three modules: (1) an agent-based module for revealing evolution mechanism of complex adaptive system using agent-based, system dynamic and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II methods, (2) an optimal module for deriving decision set of water resources allocation using multi-objective genetic algorithm, and (3) a multi-objective evaluation module for evaluating the efficiency of the optimal module and selecting the optimal water resources allocation scheme using project pursuit method. This study has provided a theoretical framework for adaptive allocation, dynamic allocation and multi-objective optimization for a complex adaptive system of water resources management.

AB  - In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, an electronic combination of a prediction market and Delphi methodology, to create a foresight support system (FSS). While the Delphi method has been a widely accepted foresight technique, prediction markets have been a very recent innovation to the existing decision and foresight support systems. Though, traditional prediction markets have been quite successful recently, our extension to the traditional prediction market methodology allows us to extract more valuable market information than any other prediction market since our approach provides not only a market forecast but also delivers an entire forecast distribution. The forecast distribution is generated by the aggregation of another unique characteristic of the suggested market structure namely that financial market professionals have to submit an interval forecast rather than point forecast. Based on our analysis, we demonstrate that our market is weak-form efficient and hence contains all publicly available information. In terms of forecasting accuracy, we conclude that the precision of our market improved over time and overall outperformed its benchmark.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel two-phase supplier selection procedure. Unlike most supplier selection researches, which are decisive based on supplier eligibility at the time of the decision making, the proposed method is based on the long term trend of value, stability, and relationship of potential suppliers. In the first phase, suppliers are evaluated and assigned a comparable value based on a set of criteria. This value is then analyzed in the long run, and fed into a multi-objective portfolio optimization model in the second phase. The model determines a supplier portfolio by maximizing the expected value and development of suppliers, and minimizing their correlated risk. The novelty of this procedure is introducing a new view toward the supplier selection problem. Numerical tests show that the proposed approach selects higher value suppliers with lower risk of failure, compared to available methods.

AB  - Suppliers can be considered as inevitable sources of external risks in modern supply chains. In this context, resilience that stands for the adaptive capability to respond to disruptions and recovering from it needs to be considered in supplier selection. But selection of suppliers is a challenging issue that involves the evaluation of both qualitative and quantitative attributes, in usual have imprecise and limited information. Grey relational analysis based on linguistic assessment of supplier rating and attribute weightings could judiciously be used under these situations to obtain a set of possibility values for prioritizing supplier selection. In this research, a supplier to be selected in the context of a resilient supply chain is termed as a resilient supplier. Taking electronic supply chain as a case study, with six alternative suppliers, grey possibility values for supplier selection were calculated and the suppliers were prioritized. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to identify how far the selection priorities of suppliers change by varying the weightings given to each of the resilience attributes. This helps us in identifying the attributes of resilience where a particular supplier performs well. A comparison of proposed grey methodology with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and analytic network process (ANP) was also conducted to comprehend extent of out-performance. The results of the proposed research could help top management in taking strategic level decision making with respect to selection of suppliers in a resilient supply chain.

AB  - Recommender systems are a valuable means for online users to find items of interest in situations when there exists a large set of alternatives. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a popular technique to build such systems which is based on explicit rating feedback on the items by a larger user community. Recent research has demonstrated that the predictive accuracy of CF based recommender systems can be measurably improved when multi-criteria ratings are available, i.e., when users provide ratings for different aspects of the recommendable items. Technically, in particular regression-based techniques have been shown to be a promising means to predict the user’s overall assessment of an item based on the multi-criteria ratings. Since in many domains customer subgroups (segments) exist that share similar preferences regarding the item features, we propose a novel CF recommendation approach in which such customer segments are automatically detected through clustering and preference models are learned for each customer segment. In addition, since in practical application constantly new rating information is available, the proposed method supports incremental updates of the preference models. An empirical evaluation of our method shows that the predictions of the resulting models are more accurate than previous multi-criteria recommendation methods.
